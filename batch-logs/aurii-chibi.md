**lapost48** - *2017-11-30*

"It's dark in here." ZaRel states noting that he can't see anything. He puffs a small purple flame into a nearby torch illuminating the room in a soft purple glow. "Anyone else in here? Anyone see a way out? Anyone remember how we got here?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-30*

"... Where did this child come from?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-30*

"Nice purple flame kid! You ever try cooking meat with it?"

**lapost48** - *2017-11-30*

"I once ate this chicken that was really good, I wasn't the one who cooked it though. Some fellow named Ittory. I don't usually cook with my flames. It's more of a light and death kind of thing."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-30*

"Ah you're familiar with Itory! How magnificent, he's been a loyal servant of the Tyndall name for years! How are you acquainted?"

**lapost48** - *2017-11-30*

"I'm not really sure. I just remember eating chicken after a heated discussion at dinner. Everyone stormed off and I ate the leftovers"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-30*

"wish I had some chicken right now"

**Bill** - *2017-11-30*

*From around the corner, a massive white feather sticks out. It waves one before the rest of the massive, man sized chicken walks around the corner, head bobbing. It turns to look at you.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-30*

"I should try that more often!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-30*

"A feather?!" *Elfriede bows* "for the glory of Lylalel!"

**lapost48** - *2017-11-30*

"That chicken looks like... a person in a costume. Look closer before attacking."

**Bill** - *2017-12-01*





**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

*Afina walks into the room, adjusting a Weiss wig* "I wish I could figure out why you all agreed I should disguise myself as this "Weiss" character. Though this "cosplay" thing is very interesting, don't you agree?

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

Aldus follows, his normal long white hair traded for a short blonde wig, and white chest plate. "I don't know this Juane character doesn't seem to have much too him, whats his "resemblance thing again?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

"I believe his resemblance was being unlucky, was it not? He vomited in the first episode I recall. Where are the others? I thought we had to leave for the convention as soon as possible!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-01*

Mobius, sitting in the corner with his lute, starts strumming.... "Weeiiiisssssssss" he sings in a purposefully strained voice

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"oh boy, whos that?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

"I... don't know. And I don't think I want to. What is he even costume-playing?" Afina squints.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-01*

Elfriede walks in also wearing a white wig 
"... Well one of us is going to have to change..."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-01*

Still sitting, Mobius waves at the group. Putting his lute down for a second, he pulls on a blond wig, and if one looks closely he seems to be wearing a beacon school uniform.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

"You were supposed to cosplay the Blake one! She reads books... she's relatively quiet....... she has a distinct fear of her comrades finding out that she isn't fully human and in fact hides her animalistic traits to appear human in a society that penalizes those that do not look as such. You thought she was exemplary!" Afina stomps her foot, the heels of the cosplay clapping against the floor.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"wait is the lute person the jaune guy too?" or maybe he's the girl with one arm?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

"Spoiler alert! I'm not past Volume 2, it's an awfully long book series to read, you know. Though I do believe the other individual over there is also cosplaying... 'John'"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"opps! well now we really need some wardrobe changes "

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

*Afina folds arms* "I'm not changing, I'm the Laera-famous Tyndall cosplay by now"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"oh my- you are THE Tyndall cosplay?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

*Afina beams* "Of course! Now WHEN can we get in the wagon to go to the con. And, in the same instance, who even has their wagon license?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"dont you have like a driver or a butler or something?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-01*

*Itory enters in Sebastian cosplay*

*so you know.... A Butler*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"ooooh which brook are you from?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-01*

*Itory blinks. His blue eyes are now red.* "Wouldn't you like to know love. Now get in the Wagon already."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

*Afina grins and hops into the wagon*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-01*

Mobius stands up and walks over, "pardon Sebastion, but may I get a ride in your wagon?"

**lapost48** - *2017-12-01*

"I could really use some chicken right about now..."

**Bill** - *2017-12-01*

*His eyes change to yellow.* "Of course sir yes."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-01*

_Grinning, Mobius climbs aboard_ "Thanks. Love the costume by the way."

**lapost48** - *2017-12-01*

ZaRel is cosplaying this

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

"Well this is surely going to be an interesting convention"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-01*

"Would it be any fun if it wasn't?"

**lapost48** - *2017-12-01*

"What is a convention?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

"yea! Thats a good question what IS a convention?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-01*

The wagon comes to a stop, yet you clearly aren't at your destination. You can hear Itory say from the front "Hey wait, you can't come up her-" before he cuts off abruptly. You turn around and





**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-03*

"Hewoo I'm Elfriede kun, I hope we can be friends desu"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-03*

"Konnichiwa, watashi wa Afina-chan-desu owo"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

OwO "I'm from Eraia nyaa~~, wonderful to meet you all!"

Elfriede scoots closer to Narder.
"You uh... you come here often...?"
"....I'm sure you heal a lot of people...."
"We're any as bad off as me?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-14*

*oh what the hell. It's non canon anyway.*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

In a bush not to far away, Eliran sits with Afina watching the two,"this stinks,"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-14*

"Sorry," Afina laughs nervously

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

"Not you" Eliran sighs, "I can see whats happening"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-14*

"What?" Afina says, cocking her head

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

*Narder completly ignores Elfriede and keeps working*
*Elfriede whispers something to Narder*
*Elfriede Massages his shoulders*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

"And they don't have a clue" he laments gesturing towards the two.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

*Narder punches Elfriede through the wall*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-14*

"Who?" Afina furrows her eyebrows.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

"They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line, our trios down to _two_"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-14*

*Aldus walks in with popcorn*

**Bill** - *2017-12-14*

*and suddenly a night light falls from the sky, hitting Eliran on the head.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

*Narder gives Elfreide a thumbs up for some reason*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

_Eliran strums his lute begining to sing_ "Can you feel the love tonight?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

*Elfriede is confused, but aroused*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-14*

Afina picks up the night light that fell from the... ceiling and inspects it. "Eliran, is this yours?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

Pausing from his strumming, Eliran rubs his head, "ow..." He looks at the nightlight, "I have no idea where it came from"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-14*

*Elfriede sees a small chicken emerge from the woods*
"No.. not again..."
*He aggresively chases the chicken with his rapier*

**Bill** - *2017-12-14*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-14*

Afina casts a blinding light magic spell. Not to fight the chicken, but as a convenient segway to the next chibi scene.

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*





**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

```Location: Tyndall Tower Study
Characters: All Active Characters```

Sitting in silence of tyndall tower, everyone save Elfriede and Eliran is enjoying thier own quiet reading. (Nokri is reading manga) Suddenly stumbling is heard outside the door and everyone glances up. 

The door is kicked open and in stumbles Elfriede who, in a very slurred voice shouts, "Wherrz all da Bishes at?!!," with Eliran in tow. 

Eliran wore a tired face like he had been dealing with a child all night. He had thought Elfriede was too uptight and decided to take him out for a night of fun and drinking. However, Faun had never drank a day in his life and had terrible tolerance. Eliran shook his head as Elfriede stumbled in and fell onto a nearby chair next to Atalantia and laughed as he was barely able to sit up straight.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Looking at Elfriede, "How can he be this _weak_ with alcohol?!" Eliran cried exasperated as he flomped onto the bed in frustration.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina sat in her high-backed chair, mouth open, face frozen in utter shock. "Pardon me," she said, slamming her book shut and standing fast. "But what exactly did you do to my escorting knight lieutenant!?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"He's always so uptight so I thought it'd be good for him to relax for once, "Eliran said groaning into a pillow, "But come _ON_ he only had tw0 cups of hard cider!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"Hahahaha, I neverrr *hic* tried anee of thus  shtuff bacc in Eranus!."
Elfriede lackadazically glances over to Atalantia.
"Yer know, I've always hed a thin for women that coud kik my ass. *hic*"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Eliran: O.O

Sighing, Eliran got off the bed and walked over to Elfriede, "Ok Elfie lets get you to a bed so you can sleep before you embarass yourself any more" He said, hoping the knight would comply.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"Wait!" Afina says. "First of all, it's a rather good thing that he likely won't remember what happened in the morning. Eraian aren't supposed to drink if my memory serves me right. However," she raises an eyebrow. "This is a unique opportunity to hear the unfiltered Elfriede. Eliran, ask him a question."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Eliran was conflicted, on one hand he should be responsible and help Elfriede avoid doing anything he would regret... but on the other hand, who wouldn't enjoy learning whats behind the Knights straightlaced ways... ok it wasn't that much of a conflict "I like the way you think princess," Eliran grinned, and leaned over to Elfriede, and asked quietly so only he would hear, "hey elfie what do you think about the princess over there, do you got a thing for her?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"Hey! That is NOT what I said you-- DUMB little-- I meant something relevant and intriguing!" Afina yelled.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"Hey I think whether or not your escorts got the hots for you is completely relevant," Eliran shot back, "plus don't you _want_ to know?" he asked looking at her knowingly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

Elfriede cocks one eyebrow, tilts his head and glances over Afina's way.

"WUT? the pincess?!? Woud be tha PerFect Girl too Bring home to Mommee and Daddee wuldn't sHE?!" 
Elfriede gets up and stumbles over to her desk amnd puts both elbows on it and supports his head with both hands. 
"WHaddjuu think Hot Stufff~~Evr Think Wat'd it Be Lik to bee wih a Laguz?!!". Elfriede then trips and falls onto his back staring at the cieling and starts laughing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Eliran snorts before covering his mouth to control his laughter.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina's nose scrunches, and one could see the corner of her eye twitching ever so slightly.

"Eliran, the Tyndalls are peaceful people, but I'm going to murder you so much. That your disease-infested children will feel my wrath for years to come."

She then turns to smile awkwardly at Elfriede.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"Sure thing princess," Eliran said still trying to stifle his laughter, "that attempt at flirting and your face were 100% worth it"

Having composed himself, Eliran walked over, "And with that I think we're done Mr. Wanna-do-it-with-a-Laguz, unless you have any more questions?" he asked, looking over to Afina.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"Yes! Of course! Elfriede!" She yells. "Don't you think Eliran is an idiotic dumb-bag?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

_Wow nice dis princess_ Eliran thought to himself, wondering what the Laguz's response would be

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

Elfriede completely ignores the question and sits up, "You kno that Lagoos ar  known fer ther stamina  Mizz Tindall?" Elfriede barely manages to get out while making the worst excuse for a suductive face.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

Aldus had been trying to ignore the goings on in the study but that was failing majorly  "Smooth, very smooth Faun, I'm sure she's head over heels for you at this exact moment. I'm going to need a drink just listening to you"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"Elfriede, you were supposed to support my stance!" Afina whines. She huffs. "I would also second that drink."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

After laughing to the point of having tears in his eyes, Eliran took a deep breath "Oh my god that was the best thing I've heard in a long time" Looking to Afina he said, "For what its worth, I had no idea it'd get this bad, so I'm a little sorry. Drinks on me?" Eliran asked, as he walked over to his sack that was left at the door when he burst in with Elfriede to begin with.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"Sounds good to me, I'm sure Mrs. Faun, I mean *Miss Tyndall* wouldn't object"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"Hey!" Afina yells, face flushing bright red.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Opening the sack, Eliran pulled out three bottles, "Relax princess, you'd said he'd forget it all in the morning yourself." he said as he set the bottles on the desk, " So, we got cider, wine, and something "a bit" stronger..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"Yes, exactly, but _I_ will not forget it!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"If you drink enough you will"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"best to make the most of it then yes? Plus why would you want to forget this? This is the most entertaining thing I've seen in weeks"

"it's nice to see Mr. Tail Up My Ass let loose a bit"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"WUT My taiile's noot in mah ASsss, Its abooveeee ittttt!!  LLoookk!" 

Elfriede starts fumbling with his trouser belt but cant figure out how it works.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"yes Elfriede i am well aware of- ooooooo yup there he goes, ya know just let him struggle see how long it takes"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina's eyes went wide and she covered her eyes. "Someone with some coherence please assist Elfriede in not dishonoring his family name."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"Oh no you don't" Eliran said as he immediately went to Elfriede and removed his hands from anywhere near his pants and belt. "This is not going to end up like last month with Ransford."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"...WHAT."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"oh well i havent heard that one yet, please enlighten us"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"When I said I came to Theanovene for enlightenment, this is not the type of information I was hoping to obtain."

Afina moved her hands from her eyes. "Is there anyone _else_ here that needs to admit to their disturbing misdeeds!?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"There are some things you can't learn in a book Afina"

"and hes right about the laguz thing"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"Eh, only if the Laguz has experience or good instincts"

"and thats a story for another time when Elfriede can remember it"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina frowns. "I'll have you know, I attended university. Empirical evidence indicates no such trend."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

Aldus shakes his head at Afinas sexual innocence

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"Ah yes, because books know so much about 'The sex' right?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"How dare-! It's not like I haven't- the nerve of some people! You dirty nomadic-- UGH!" Afina angrily collapses in her chair.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"Ya know? I think theyre perfect for each other, they can grow together" "sexually"

"So you ever been with anyone Elfriede? I mean if were asking him questions..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina perks her head up, actually curious to hear the answer to this question.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

A collapsed Elfriede stirs again, "I-I ...ohh yerr, SO MANYYYY, all those clergiiieee womennn thattt iii-... NOOO OKAYYY, Lezz Grow togehtor princezz, show me the weyyy TO En LIGHT en Meant." Elfriede snorts at his really really bad (the worst) pun.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Eliran gave a short laugh, "good one." Pouring three cups full with the cider, he continued, "so drinks anybody?" he said to Afina and Aldus.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

Aldus attempts to recover from laughing "hes even more innocent then she is!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina exhales a sigh of relief.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"I would imagine light magic could get quite fun"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"See that's what you'd think until your partner accidentally blinds you cause they can't focus on their magic"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina squints at Aldus. "How... even..." she then shifts her attention to Eliran. "Do you even know how...?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"Afina is finer trained, surely"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"True, but she lacks experience on the non magical end"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"Yerr soo experienceeed Elirannnnn!~" Eyes full of admiration he looks back from his prone position

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

"No! Do not venerate him! Elfriede!"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"aw Elfriede is ok, im sure someday soon, a nice upstading beautful woman will teach you the ways of um -cough- "the sex" "

he looks pointedly at afina while saying this

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

Elfriede stumbles to his feet and wobbled over to the door he came in. 
"Itoreee, culld youu Reddy a bathhh forr meee!" He shouts down the hall. 

"Aghhh itssss beern Agessss sinnnse I *hic* hadd a bathhhh!" (literally had a bath this morning)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina presses a hand to her forehead and sighs. That would be the most innocent action to be suggested in this room in the last few minutes.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"Yeaaaaa Itory went to bed a few hours ago, shame i know not where the bathroom is, Someone who has spent extesive amounts of time here should show him where the bath is"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

Responding to Afina, Eliran look her like 'seriously?'  "I am the best musician in Theanovene, how do you think? And I do agree with you actually, I should not be venerated."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"He is the best I'll give him that"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina shoots Aldus a pointed "don't you dare suggest it before Elfriede hears you" look.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

"I what? I have no idea what your talking about, Eliran wheres that bottle of whatever you had?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina stands up, grabs a blanket, and wraps it around Elfriede's shoulders as he stands, confused, in the doorway. "Itory went to bed earlier. Let me escort _you_ somewhere that you can sleep off this... drink." She puts an arm around his shoulder to beckon him into the hall.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

"Remember he can't consent when he's drunk princess!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina shoots a glare over her shoulder at the two _boys_ in the study.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"Aree wee going tooo go takee a bathhh Missstrysss?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina chuckles. "No, Elfriede, you're going to take a nice nap."

"And... hopefully not remember anything in the morning or else you'll be severely embarrassed."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

Aldus walks up next to Eliran with a bottle of - something- he found in Elirans bag and takes a swig then offers it to Eliran "Want some?" He says while taking a mental picture in his head of the princess and the drunken knight lieutenant

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-21*

"Definitely," Eliran said as he took a swig himself. As he swallowed he shook his head a little, "what a kick, you chose the strongest one in the batch." He said grinning. "Do you think we teased the princess to much?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

"There were more? hmmmm maybe a little, but the blushing was worth it"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-21*

"Agreed." Eliran said as he hopped on the bed again, "definitely the best night I've had in a while."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

"why is there a bed in the study anyway?" he muses while taking a seat on the edge of the bed

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

"Maybe it's so you can take a break from studying" Eliran said "or maybe Afina is more lewd than we thought and uses it to 'study'. " As he took another swig, he continued, "Either way, I'm just happy it's here now."

```Location: Tyndall Tower Study
Characters: All Active Characters```
The Situation: Its the morning after, Eliran wakes up next to Aldus, both mostly clothed but clearly disheveled, what happened with them is anybody's guess, but it definitely involves the alcohol, as there are two empty bottles on the ground. At the same time Elfriede is waking up in the bath tub, and Afina is waking up in her room.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

Elfriede stirs and glances around confused. Then suddenly his eyes go wide as he feels the need to wretch.

"Ughhh... What did I.. "

He gasps aloud as his eyes go wide again. He only remembers bits and pieces but he remembers says some specifically unkind things about the Lady of the tower.

His face flushes red as he is overwhelmed with embarrassment.
Faun uneasily stood and shuffled passed Afinas room in which he heard stirring. He immediately stars moving to the other side of the house on the farthest possible floor. Elfriede huddled in the corner of the dining room in fetal position, too afraid to face Afina.
He glances up and to the side to see Itory's very dissapointed stare and his face flushes again as he buries it in his knees.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina yawns, sitting up to stretch in her blue nightgown. She glances lazily about the room, scratching her blonde bedhead. Pulling aside the covers, she slides her feet into slippers, and stands up. Outside her window, Theanovene bustles productively. She folds her arms and looks out the window at the fast-moving people and carts below. "Itory!" She calls, "Is breakfast prepared?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

"As soon as you are ready for it Milady." Itory says. He doesn't stop staring at Elfriede.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

Elfriede was going over last night's events in his head. He remembers fumbling with his belt but did.. did he ***expose*** himself?! If a superior officer found out about what he did... He would be exiled... Or *worse*. Publicly stripped and flogged. Elfriede shivers. 

"Not to mention what Afina thinks of me now.."

 Elfriede groans. "She probably thinks me a fool."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina frowns. "In the dining room, then?" She yells, brows furrowed. That's right, she forgot to request breakfast in bed for that morning. She shrugged, figuring she shouldn't inconvenience Itory too much. She walked briskly out of her bedroom, the door slamming shut behind her. She peered into the study, laughing to herself at the sight of Aldus and Eliran, before descending the stairs. Whatever Itory had made smelled GOOD.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

_rude_ Eliran thought as Afina passed, sitting up, he put Aldus under the covers and tried with moderate success to make himself look more presentable, it's been a while since he's had Tyndall cooking for breakfast and he was not going to miss it.  Getting up he headed downstairs, it was time to **consume**

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

Itory bore no expense on breakfast. Plates of bacon, eggs, sausage, coupled with an impressive three stacks of pancakes lie in the center of the table. The chef himself steps out with a final plate of cinnamon smelling pastries before bowing to Afina. "I took the liberty of over preparing. I assume your... guests will be quite hunger." He then steps towards the kitchen door. "I am but a bell away, should you require" his eyes flick to Eliran, "anything Milady."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina nods and graciously takes a seat at the table. Immediately she starts stacking her plate with food, before noticing her guests. "Good morning Eliran, Elfriede," she says, almost dismissively.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

"He never really liked me did he?" Eliran asked as he sat down ready to eat, surprisingly poised, as if he were nobility himself, if it weren't for his disheveled hair, one might think he was the more noble out of Afina and him, considerjg her plate.

"Good morning to you too princess, elfriede, how you feeling ?" He asked

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-23*

Nokri finished drying the last utensil and put it away, back into the drawer of preparation tools. The chef had praised her for doing well her first day on the job as a cook. At least, the foodstuffs she helped to prepare appeared perfectly scrumptious.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

"I slept quite well," she nodded, in between mouthfuls of food. "Elfriede, are you feeling better?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

"ughhhh" he groaned not raising his head. He gets up and sits in a chair not taking a moment to glance Afina's way in the slightest. He sits and just stares down at the empty plate. 

"I..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina pauses mid-chew to give him a questioning look. "Are you alright?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

"He's probably hungover as hell," Eliran said. "You should ask Itory to prepare a bucket and door post drinking food" He picked out a pancake stack and a sausage to put on his plate. "Really though I can't believe he is such light weight".

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

"You know he's not supposed to drink at ALL," she glares at Eliran.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

Elfriede abruptly stands up and looks to Afina, face red with small tears brimming.
"I'm sorry for the lewd and disgraceful things I've said Lady Afina Tyndall!"
He abruptly turns and runs out of the room into the library.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina shot Eliran a "see what you did" look across the table. "Are you going to fix the knight lieutanant you broke, or is that my duty?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

"I probably should, shouldn't I?" He asked as he chewed.  "Unless of course you want a chance to get closer to your crush and work on your casual racism. " he said, looking her in the eye.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

"First of all I don't-- nevermind. I'll deal with your harsh accusations and irrational commentary later. I hope you speak with your boyfriend as well sometime today," she stands, and the chair scoots backwards with a harsh scraping noise. She walked towards the hallway, peering out. "Elfriede?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

Elfriede sits in the study with the blankets over his head in a mound. Too disgraced to show his face.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina looks into the study and sighs with relief. "You realize that it isn't very becoming of a knight lieutenant to sit with a blanket over his head, yes?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

Sighing, Eliran finished his meal alone, _I really should apologize I guess_ he thought. And then he realized something, _Did she say **boyfriend**?_

"Great that's another thing I got to clear up." He muttered to himself as he picked up the finished plates, and brought them back to the kitchen to clean them. _Still, I'll give those two some time alone. Even if they don't admit it, at least they'll get closer probably._

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

"I.. I just, *sigh* you're right.." 
Elfriede takes off the blanket but still won't look her in the eye. He felt his face flush and heart race. 
".... I .........  I.... Can't... I can't believe I said Enlightenment.."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina sits down next to him, gingerly keeping a comfortable distance. She chuckles at the reminder of Elfriede's... interesting attempt at being suave. "Well. I truly appreciate the creativity with that one. I haven't actually heard it before. Who would have known that Elfriede Faun, very studious knight, could make sure a lighthearted joke?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

"I-I called you... Hotstuff. How could I say such a degrading... I mean that's not to say that your n-- I j-just ughhh" He held his head; On top of this his head was still spinning and he felt like he could wretch at any moment.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina awkwardly laughed. "You did... yes you did. But alcohol lowers inhibitions, and clearly you are quite funny when drunk. For instance, you insisted you were a laguz and wanted to show everyone your 'tail'." She laughed. "That? Quite hilarious!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Elfriede's eyes widen and his heart skipped a beat. He said..... He said... What... Why would he... Ahh but she didn't believe him. Maybe he'll get out of this unscathed. 
"Yeahh.. haha funny things sometimes you say when you are drunk." 
Elfriede was impressed with how well he was able to pass off his sharp teeth, how well he was able to suppress his animalistic nature, the only thing that would give him away was his tail. 
If someone ever found out.. no... His family would... 
"I'm sorry I in my state of.. unthinking.. I mistook your... mistrust of some of that race as a.... I don't know what came over me." Elfriede straightened and smiled awkwardly hoping....

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

And as if on queue, Eliran bursts into the (having just finished washing the dishes) somewhat loudly, "He is _not_ my boyfriend!" He declared defiantly to Afina, pointing in Aldus's direction.

"We're drinking buddys." He added somewhat more calmly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina's brows furrow in confusion. "Did you really. We were in the middle of a. Do you ever think of anyone but." She sighs. "Well, Elfriede, are you at least feeling alright now?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

"You said it, I had to deny it lest you wanted to spread rumors. A musicians relationship status greatly affects our popularity with the masses!!!" Eliran said in a huff, then he noticed Elfriede, who looked to Eliran to be slightly off kilter, "Ah... you must of heard about some of the stuff you said last night..." he walks over and pats the laguz Knight on the back, "Don't worry man, alcohol gets to the best of us... Though your tolerance level is like Record settingly low."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina frowns. "He wasn't supposed to drink to begin with."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

"I just wanted to help him relax a little and he said he wanted to try, look I swear I didn't expect.... Well I didn't expect what happened in the least." Eliran explained, then sighed. "We were just supposed to be cracking open a cold one with the boys." He looked to Retrieve, "And for what it's worth I'm sorry about letting you get that far, especially since I gave you the idea about the laguz joke." He said, knowing the poor boy was probably trying to hide in the closet, and giving him an easy way out.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Elfriede felt the churning feeling in his stomach. 
"Uhoh."
He clasps his hand over his mouth and sprints out if the room.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

"Well that's the alcohol talking... I'm gonna go make sure he gets it in the toilet" Eliran said, running off with the knight lieutenant.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Elfriede returns in a bit walking slowly with disappointed eyes. "I feel... Better..."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Eliran follows in behind him. "Hey you did better than most, nothing on the ground, everything in the toilet."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina frowns, wanting to offer support but not sure how. "can I offer you... um... Itory probably has an herbal remedy somewhere?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Eliran chimed up "Speaking from experience, ginger tea and some toast with honey is probably a good idea for the knight lieutenant." He paused, "you know I think I saw some in the kitchen, I'll prepare it for you." He said, as he walked out and headed for the kitchens.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Is Eliran doing this intentionally, Noticing they were along again.
"Hey I just wanted to formally apologize." Faun says bowing low in a militarized fashion.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

((Yes, yes he is))

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"You don't have to, Im sure there will be another time I will have to excuse my _own_ actions. And then perhaps we can call it even," she chuckled. "Or maybe someday you'll want to show everyone your non-existent tail again."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

*A chill runs down his spine again* "Ye-yeah! Haha!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina leans over, "Or after that conversation last night, maybe you'll just want to show _me_" she whispers.

Afina promptly bursts into laughter afterwards. "It's alright Elfriede, I'm just joking, you know."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

((Also you two aren't alone, Aldus is sleeping right next to you))

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

All the hairs on his arms stood on end at the comment. 
He was about to ask her to repeat herself, maybe he hadn't heard that right. But then she said she was joking, but *was she?* Did she really want to see his tail? Had she finally realized that he was telling the truth the whole time? Maybe she just didn't want to reveal it to the others. Maybe he should deflect. No... No she deserved to know. After all this time.

Elfriede grabs her hand and tugs her up to her room.
"We're alone. I can show you. P-promise you won't laugh."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"I-- Elfriede!? Are you-- what are you-- are you sure? I mean. Aren't you not supposed to...?" Afina asks.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Eliran returns shortly after the two head up, "where did they go?" He wonders aloud. _Well I guess I'll wait here_ he thinks, and sits down in a chair and sips one of two mugs of tea that he brought back on a tray of anti hangover snacks and drinks.

shocked by the yell of a Ransford that even he could hear down the hall, Eliran  almost spills his tea on himself.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

"We don't have a lot of time before Itory gets up here so let's do this quickly!" He turns around.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

***"Faun!"***

The door swings open and a red faced Ransford Gale barrels into the room. His face is tomato red and you can smell his breath from across the room. It smells like alcohol. 

"Faaaaaaaun, ya an yah boi Eriri an dich'd meh!" he slurs. He grimaces, then slaps his own face. "You and your boy ditch me at the bar! We haz drinks to drink!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

_FUCK I THOUGHT WE GOT AWAY FROM HIS DRUNK ASS SINCE HE DIDNT GET BACK LAST NIGHT_ Eliran thought to himself

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Elfriede froze halfway into dropping his trousers, staring at this drunken ... Asshole. Afina behind him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina's mouth drops open. "What...?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

"We have **drinks** to drink!" he bellows and throws an arm around Elfriede's shoulder. Drunk as he is, Ransford barely supports his own weight and leans heavily on the laguz.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Getting up Eliran ran to find the drunken.. asshole. Running down the hall he spots Afinas open door, slowing down and cautiously peering into the room.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Elfriede was getting violently shaken by Ransford with his pants partially unbuckled with the most melancholic face ever viewed by anyone ever. He was too overwhelmed to even be embarrassed at this point.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"Elfriede are we still going to...?" Afina asks hesitantly.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

Ransford's eyebrows wiggle dangerous.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Eliran sighed internally, clearly a bro was in need. He walked carefully behind ransford, grabbing what looked to be one of Afinas heaviest hard back books, and slammed it down on the drunken fools head.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"Eliran!" Afina shrieked. "THAT BOOK IS 500 YEARS OLD!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

"I know but you don't keep any other blunt force objects in your room what else could I use to knock him out?" Eliran shot back, "Or do you think it's a good idea for this asshole to catch you two here when he's drunk?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

Ransford groans.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"CATCH us? There was nothing to catch!" Afina says, pointing at Elfriede.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Eliran prepares for strike two.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

"Are... you not drunk anymore boy?" he mutters. "The night is young!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

"You don't understand how he gets when he's dru-" Eliran starts when he gets cut off by ransfords "the night is young"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"Commander, it is nine in the morning," Afina says flatly, swiping her book back from Eliran. Afina couldn't believe what had been about the happen, and even moreso what it got interrupted by.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

Ransford slowly comes to his feet. 

"Have you never drank in the traditional respect to Lylalel? And I thought you were a learned lady."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

"Aren't worshipers of Lylalel not supposed to drink?" She rolls her eyes, arms folded.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

"That's just cider boy over there." Ransford cricks his neck. "Drinking is a time honored tradition in the military."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-24*

Afina turns to Elfriede, eyebrow cocked. "Well. _Boys_. If you're going to go back to drinking, and interrupting my, er, studies. Then I'll be excusing myself," she says, chin lifted high, and strutting out of her room. Despite being barefoot and in a nightgown, she held herself as if she walked in the most elegant attire in Aurii.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

Eliran stifled a laugh at the way Afina left the room.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

Elfriede just stands there staring as she left.... As his soul left his body.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

Ransford pulls half a dozen whiskey bottles from... somewhere. 

***"DRINKS!"***

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-24*

"Itory...if you could.... Remove him.." Assuming Itory was some secret martial arts Butler.

He just gave that vibe.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-24*

"You know officer, I really would love to but I have to... Uh... Go put on a performance at.... A place that isn't here.". Eliran said as he quickly backed out of the room and went to find Afina and apologize again for this.

**Bill** - *2017-12-24*

Itory walks past the open door. 

"I serve the Tyndalls Sir Faun."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"and you don't think this guy is a threat to the....*sigh* nevermind.



```Location: Tyndall Tower Study
Characters: All Active Characters```

A few hours after the events of Ransford he sat with an icepack on his head getting over his massive hangover in the dining room. Everyone else sat scattered around him when the effects of Nokri's secret test potion began to kick in. While preparing dinner she had added *something* to the food.

Suddenly everyone felt nauseous and light headed. One by one everyone passed out. All came to 15 minutes later... *as the opposite gender*.
(what am I doing with my life)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Aldus wakes up, something is weighing heavy on his chest, but what? He doesn't remember having any anxiety before... "-what the..." he says, sitting up. *that's not anxiety* "these are breasts!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

From upstairs on the study daybed, there's the loud sound of a young man yelling. Thumping resounded off the walls of Tyndall Tower, before a young man with blonde hair and a.... gray dress burst into the hallway. "Who is responsible for this!?" Afina yelled, a dress that normally hit her knees now showing dangerous amounts of thigh.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran groans as 'he' sits up, "keep it down now why don't you? some of us are trying to sleep." Looking around 'he' gets confused, "hey did somebody turn off the lights? I can't see shit..." 'He' asks. To anybody else, they can clearly see Eliran has an insane amount hair, which thankfully is covering most of his upper torso as well as his face, considering Eliran normally sleeps shirtless.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Nokri had been sitting on a stool in the kitchen munching on some of the leftovers when she passed out. She was none too happy waking up on the cold tile, and felt oddly hungover. "The [censored] man, I mostly followed the recipe," she muttered. Her voice was deeper and she noticed a few changes in her body. *Neat. This could be good. What did I add to that food?* He couldn't recall. Maybe if he found some gloves and a metric ton of soap he could dig through the garbage, or bribe someone else to do it.
A shout echoed throughout the walls that sent a shiver up his spine though. *That can't be good. I didn't do it.* He walked into the pantry and shut the door.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

At the sound of the yelling the young lady Elfriede sits up and rubs her eyes. 

"How unbecoming of me I seem to have fallen asleep while eati-- ...!"

Elfriede grabs her throat at the sound of the higher pitched voice and started desperately glancing around confused at all these strangers in the clothes of her friends.

"W-whats happening here!!?!?" the flustered young lady says panicked.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"What did you do potion girl?!" Aldus yells in a new voice loud enough for Nokri to hear *her* "I swear, when I find you..." she says stumbling to her feet and glancing around at the other, eyes settling on the other women in the room. "oh no you guys too?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Finally realizing something was in her eyes, Eliran brushes the hair out of hair face and stands up, only to feel her pants start to slip, _shit_ she thought, quickly grabbing her pants and holding them up embarassed, it was then she realized how different things were. Slender legs, long hair and... What were these things on her chest??? "What the hell is going on here??" she squeaked.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Aldus blushes profusely at Eliran and Elfriede. Especially Eliran given *her* current state *Oh no they're hot*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Another voice, this time feminine, echoed distantly and reached Nokri's ears, directly calling her out. He cursed and frantically looked around the pantry. Its stock was a bit depleted after breakfast, as the food for lunch and dinner had already been taken out to be prepared.
Any boxes he could find were pushed up against the door, simultaneously locking him in and serving as a minor barrier to anyone who would think to open the door. Maybe no one would recognize Nokri as a guy and he'd get off scott free by pretending to be some random teenager.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede quickly ran over to the nearest mirror in Tyndall tower and gazed into it feeling her new facial features and hair. 

"Oh no.. I-I'm.. " He glances back to the rest of the party. 

"I'm cute!!" O//o//O "I look like a younger Yuria!!"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Throwing one of the large cloth napkins from tables at Eliran , Aldus tries to hide his blush and exclaims "please, just, take this and stop *moving* so much"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina, at the sound of strangers in the dining room, sprints into the room with book open, light manifesting in... HIS hand. The blue nightgown swooshes with every movement. "WHO DARE BREACHES TYNDALL TOWER?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"T-thanks" Eliran said, still a little shook by her new appearance, as she tried to unfold the napkin and cover her chest and not drop her pants with minimal success.

"Um...does anybody have a belt?" She asked hesitently

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Blonde, hair, blue eyes, light magic... *as far as i know afina doesn't have a brother* "A-Afina?? no no stop its us we're all... like you!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina cocks his head in confusion, closing the book in his other hand. "Al...dus?" He asks hesitantly. "The rest of you... Elfriede? _Eliran?_" Afina asks, snorting slightly at Eliran's 'condition'.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Do you have any clothes h--- uh she? could borrow? please this is getting distracting" Aldus says trying not to watch Elirans pants slip down.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Hey don't you snort at me!" Eliran exclaimed as she defiantly pointed at Afina, dropping the napkin, but still managing to hold her pants.

_fuck_ she thought, quickly covering up with her hands as best she could.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina laughs, taking off the ill-fitting blue nightgown and throwing it at Eliran. "Now hurry and give me those pants," Afina commands, standing in the kitchen in women's underwear. "Near nudity is unbecoming of a young prince."

**Bill** - *2017-12-27*

*Now whose a protector of women*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"thank you _princess_" Eliran said, grabbing the nightgown. Slightly forgeting her state for second, she lets the pants fall first, and puts the night gown on over top, completely unaware that she basically just flashed her ass to the room. "Much better" better she said, now clothed, tossing the pants to Afina, who she just realized (due to afina's current atire) was packing heat, and also far from an unattractive specimen. "um thanks again" she said, this time blushing a little, which was an odd feeling, since Eliran usual has control over those kinds of things.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"yes-better" Aldus is expecting a rise in his pants but it doesn't come, "oh... right"  he mutters

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina mumbles something about "respector of women" while pulling on the pants. "A prince has a duty to provide for his constituents. Even if it includes the... nightgown off his back. Nevertheless. What exactly happened here? I won't argue with the lack of breasts," Afina begins, touching his bare chest. "But the bodily changes I can't say I'm a fan of."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

_I think I saw something I'm a fan off_ Eliran thought before mentally trying to banish the thought from her head, "I'm not sure but things are definitely different..." she said looking down feeling up her chest, "these things are so much fun to play with."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"wh-" Aldus looks down at his own chest and bounces on his feet slightly "oh- whoa!" Bouncing a lot heavier this time "oh, ouch what the? "

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Faun staring in the mirror at what little chesticles he got compared to some of the others. Almost nothing there!
Elfriede finally stops gazing in the mirror and turns to everyone, suddenly noticing he had shrunk an inch or two. Afina was now taller then him! WHAT.

"How did this happen!? How do I go back!"

She glances around noticing a missing party.
"*NOKRI*"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"well, yes obviously Nokri, who else?!" Aldus says with a slight attitude

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Really noticing Aldus's full state for the first time, "oh my god you're gorgeous" Eliran said, walking over, much more comfortable now that she was clothed, "I mean look at those things!" she said poking one of the chesticles lightly. "they're _so_ soft" she said.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"hey wait!" Aldus didn't think her cheeks could get any redder, she steps back and covers her chest tightly with her arms, which only pushes them up, making them peek out through the laces of her low cut sleep tunic.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede winces and turns away blushing*
Way too much stimulation, we gotta fix this.
She hops over to pincess Afina and gazes upward at him.

"What should we do?!! I guess we should find that little gremlin."

She grits her sharp teeth.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Nokri started munching on whatever dry, edible food could be eaten without preparation. Most boxes were now blocking the only doorway and he was eyeing a nice jar of pickles, trying to discern if they were ready for consumption or not. Yum, pickles.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina made a confused face of disgust at Eliran and Aldus' shenanigans. Same old boys, Afina thought, crossing his arms. Elfriede struts up to Afina, and he can't help but smile at how small she is now. Completely ignoring the question, Afina has to make fun of the knight lieutenant just a _little_ bit. "Elfriede you're quite small now, how are you supposed to be the big body when you're such a small individual?" He laughs.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"He's always been small, nothing new there!" Aldus says while ducking out of reach of Eliran and joining the other 2"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Walking over to the other 2, Eliran joined the crew, "hey there short stuff, so what we gonna do?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriedes eyebrows furrow and her cheeks puff up a bit.

*Elfriede grumbles at Afina*
"Well..! I..!!!"

She looks down and pouts.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Look if there is one thing about Nokri I know - now granted I dont know alot BUT - She loves to monch"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede pulls rapier out of *somewhere* "There is only one choice." she says sternly.

"For the glory of Lylalel, because theres no way that gremlin is holy."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina pushes down the rapier gently. "There there Elfriede, no reason to murder our chef just yet. This is an interesting insight into how the other side lives. Truly."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"whoa whoa that holy fire!" she says helping Afina lower Elfriede's wrist gently"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"For once I couldn't agree more Afina." Eliran said, also helping lower Elfriedes weapon. "Not only is this a chance to try new things, but if we kill the Nokri, we aint changing back. "

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede continues to grumble while staring blankly*
"But-but, maybe itll wear off!"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"And if it doesn't? I dont know about you but i have no intentions of trying to explain to my mother that she has a daughter now"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran looked at her like 'seriously?' "Do you really want to take that risk. Remember every second we're in these bodies, the closer we get to _that_."  She said, shuddering at the last word.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina goes wide eyed. "That?" He asks nervously.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Oh you're fine," Eliran said, waving Afina off, "you're just going to be horny all the time and trying to hide it. But us, we're gonna have to deal with something guys never do." Eliran said, pausing to raise suspense.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Aldus's eyes go wide also "which is?" almost afraid to ask

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"We're going to start having to deal with the women's birth right plight, _periods_."

Eliran was in full on story mode now, "Imagine, no longer do you get to walk the streets feeling fine all day everyday."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede gasps in terror*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"instead, at least once a month, you feel something hurt, like in the bladder area,  and it's just like, Like someone squeezing your insides"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Oh NO, oh nooooo I do not, I cannot , I-I-I how do I even"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"PLUS blood comes out of your body, pouring out like satans waterfall while you writhe in pain from your cramps."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina rolls her eyes, "it's not that bad, you guys."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede is in fetal position rocking back and forth.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Yes it is! don't you even lie! I've heard the stories!" Aldus feels a small pain in his lowed abdomen "pleaseee noooo"

Aldus nervously walks around in a circle "ok  ok calm down boys- i mean girls - i mean uhhh everyone calm down. we just have to find Nokri and hopefully she can help with this"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede abruptly stands and takes out the rapier again, "Theres definetly no choice."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Put that damn thing away Faun!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Put that thing down you fool!" Eliran said, "Remember, we need her to change back!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede growls(it was definetly a growl)*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina cocks an eyebrow. He had to admit, he likes the fighting spirit. As a boy, Elfriede was usually a bit more docile; this was an interesting difference to say the least. "At least _I_ have nothing to worry about." He grins.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Faun suddenly turns and tackles Afina and growls* ... *but he barely moves*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Yea?? you think?" Aldus takes the back of his hand and firmly taps Afina in between his legs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina staggers from the sudden impact, his face heating up in embarrassment. "Elfriede, what-- this isn't noble behavior!"

Holding the vicious Elfriede upright, Afina makes a pleading look at his cohorts.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran walks over to Afina, "you have your own set of problems" she says, moving in a way that is _extremely distracting._ "Theres a reason why men call women temptresses." she said, now right next to Afina, pulling the somewhat small nightgown to show more than a little skin, namely showing off her breasts a bit. "Plus you have one _huge_ weakness".

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina's eyebrows furrow, and he glares at Eliran. "Yes, though for someone who has spent a long while as a brother-- er, sister figure. I'm going to have to give a firm rejection." Afina pushes Eliran aside with his one free arm, the other still holding Elfriede at bay. "I'll say, being a woman in a house of men was irritating. But the other way around is just an impediment to my own productivity."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Look can we just go find  Nokri so i can get back to the problem i *know* how to deal with?!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran puts his hands up, "thats fair. Still, before I switch back I want to try something."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"oh no, Im scared"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina pushes the blonde hair out of his eyes, trying to tuck it behind his ear out of habit. He soon realizes that his hair isn't long enough to do so, and feigns an itch. "Try something? No, no sir. You will not be trying any nefarious actions in this Tower."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Who said it was nefarious? I'm not going to hurt anybody"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina gives an 'are you serious' look. "It's you."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran feigns offense. "I never go out of my way to be _nefarious_"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede still growling and trying to tackle the prince*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina, with this newfound height, smushed Elfriede into his chest, now addressing Eliran properly. Afina mocks Eliran's pretty female voice, "I'm Eliran, I love to be naked, I want to seduce my friends just for the experience. Physical affection is something to be taken lightly." Afina finishes, and cocks an eyebrow.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede stops and her face flushes*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"1. I don't sound like that, 2. I don't seduce friends for _JUST_ for the experience, and 3. Physical affection is not taken lightly, I have _STANDARDS_."

"also I don't love being naked. I think I was clearly trying _not_ to be naked earlier."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Ha! Standards! Low ones," Afina says, leaning over to be eye level with Eliran. Afina then stands up straight, triumphantly. Poor Elfriede is dragged through the whole thing, though Afina had begun absent-mindedly stroking her hair. Wow, girls were soft.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"You know what you're right, especially since I just tried to seduce you of all people."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

The corner of Afina's eye twitches, the same angry tick he has as a female. "That's no way to address a prince, especially an objectively aesthetically pleasing one."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Aldus snickers to herself "oh shit, remember when i said we should all *calm down* yea..."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*faun starts to get sleepy* "uuuu.......you smell ni--- AgH!" *Elfriede starts trying to wriggle free*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran snorted, "Puh-lease, you act as if after all these years pulling rank is going to work, you should know better than that _princess_"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina releases Elfriede, instead getting in Eliran's face. "I never appreciated your loose behavior as a female and definitely do not tolerate it as a male. You know I give you pass on saying 'Lady' Afina for good reason and could easily revoke such a privilege."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"and now we are in a full fledged dick measuring contest - tit measuring contest? anyway Im going to look for Nokri sooooo?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"Sure *Lady* Tyndall", *she grimaces and acknowledges Aldus* "Lets go find her."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Thankfully someone is seeing sense here"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran stands defiantly in front of her, hearing Aldus's comment Eliran smirks, "either way I win," she says, "And you don't have any right to judge my lifestyle when you live up here in your little castle and I had to spend most of my life on the streets."

And with that, she turns and walks over to aldus's side, pointedly ignoring the princess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina shakes his head. "Stupid boys," he mumbles.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Now Elfriede, you may not know this being human and all but Laguz have extremely good sense of smell" he starts leading Elfriede into the kitchen

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina trails behind the three women, squinting at Elfriede's behind. Something seemed peculiar, maybe it was the clothes...?

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"And luckily, I know that Nokri smells like a mix of flowers and sugar - on account of all the monching shes always doing annnnd a little bit of chemical scent too - but we wont talk about that"  Aldus sniffs the air repeatedly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina has half a mind to ask Aldus about if laguz really do lick themselves clean, but decides against it, further analyzing Elfriede instead.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede glances back and sees Afinas eyes snap away from something. "What are you staring at Prince?......" OHSHIT.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina jolts from surprise. "You have a little... something... back..." Afina motions to his own derrière.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Despite getting more muscular, Nokri was still unable to get the tightly sealed lid off of the jar of pickles. He considered smashing it but didn't want to attract attention to the unassuming pantry, so he just stared at it angrily. The distant din of noise from the dining room started to shift, as though it was drawing nearer, so she retreated deeper into the back of the pantry.

**Bill** - *2017-12-27*

*the jar's lid pops off.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede spins around and covers her rear.* "W-we really should be focusing on finding Nokri!"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Aldus hears a pop from inside the pantry "AH! this way!" he says placing his hands on the handles of the pantry"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Ah, I'm-- I apologize then!" Afina declares, averting eye contact. Great, now I look like a pervert, Afina thinks.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Hearing a pop, Nokri turned around and was delighted to see the pickle jar open. It was shady as to why all of a sudden it did open but he didn't care, and returned to the shelf to grab the tasty treat.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"Ehhheh..." Elfriede backs up to the wall near the pantry avoiding eye contact with Afina.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"wait aldus before we go in I need to ask you something," Eliran says putting a hand on Aldus's shoulder

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina's eyes shoot up towards Eliran. "Don't-" he starts.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"yes?" she turns  around confused

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"well.." Eliran gets closer and whispers something into aldus's ear, so that nobody could hear. It was basically a request to hook up again, either before or after Aldus switched back to male, while Eliran was still female.

This was to quiet for any human ears to hear

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina mentally starts screaming.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"uhhuhuh I uhhhhh w-w-what??" Aldus stammers nervously her mind swarms with images she had forgotten about from a few nights ago, she does look quite beauti- "Eliran this isn't the time for that, you and I will talk about reviewing your finances later, right now we need to find Nokri so she can switch *me*- I mean *us* YES ALL of us back"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"But Aldus think about it a potion to change genders would make bank!" Eliran said loudly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Finances?, Afina wonders, cocking an eyebrow. Eliran has money? Maybe he should start charging rent.

"Nokri, ladies?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede's eyebrows wiggle dangerously*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Now extremely distracted and feeling a new sensation in her nether regions she steals herself and opens the door Inside Aldus finds a small. blonde young man scrunched up into the corner gorging themselves on pickles.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*the door opens the other way so the barricading did nothing*

"Well whose this cute young lad...?" the tiny girl says, words dripping with rhetoric.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Why hello there little boy, are you lost?" Eliran adds sarcastically.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"He is kinda cute isn't he?" Aldus says accidentally out loud

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Nokri was shook. He started coughing in surprise and jumped to his feet. The cronch of the pickles had drowned out the voices that were getting closer so he hadn't noticed until it was too late, and his beautiful barricade was useless. He used his sleeve to wipe the juice off his face and adjusted his collar.
"H-hello there ladies. My name is Irkon, just a lowly servant. Can I help you?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Irkon? You dont fool me! I know what you smell like Nokri! No one else smells like that!"

"Also - you wanna share those pickles?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

"Who is this... Nokri, you speak of?" He asked nervously, handing over the pickles. *Freakin' Aldus. This must be him, this chick's the spitting image.* He glared at her, the fact that Aldus's chest was bigger than hers did not go unnoticed. "She must be quite the fantastic person to have so many searching for her. I would like to meet her some day."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Very funny Nokri," Eliran said with her hands on her hips, "So how about you make a potion to switch us back"

"also Aldus can I get a pickle?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

"Are you maybe looking for the head chef? Again, I am Irkon. Lowly kitchen help. That's me. I know nothing of potions or the like. But maybe if I had some gold I could learn or come up with something. Yeah."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"hmm, I don't know about gold, but I do know somebody who's been really wanting to give you some steel." Eliran said while pointing back at Elfriede.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Sure I'll give you a pickle" She takes one and hands the jar over, then chokes slightly reasling what she just said

At the same time Aldus feels eyes on her chest and feels slightly violated *thats new*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina smacks the pickle jar out of the conversation. "Nokri, by command of the Laeran Nobility and Military, switch us back."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Those were perfectly good pickles!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Irrelevant, more can be procured. Now, Nokri?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

The jar falls to the ground and breaks, making a mess and getting pickle juice all over Eliran, Aldus, and Nokri.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

" *great* Now I'm all wet"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Hey! Those were good pickles and now my outfit is a mess!" Eliran said alarmed and upset that she could no longer eat a pickle.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Nokri dropped to his knee and kneeled deeply, vinegar dripping down his hair. "Why, prince...ess? I did not see you there, my deepest most profound apologies. Alas, I have no clue as to how this happened or what can be done to resolve it. I beg most profusely for this insolence. I will do everything possible in my power to rectify it if you would be so merciful as to allow me a chance, your highness." He lowered his head to the ground in a bow.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"damn suck up - same as always - eh Nok?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Eldriede turns her nose up at the overwhelming pungent smell of pickles*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

If his head wasn't on the ground and covered in pickle juice Nokri would very much have loved to drop-kick Aldus

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

ugh, I dont need those lagu senses right *now*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

And of course, they were in the presence of *royalty*. What an honor, Nokri could not disgrace herself further.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede holding her nose in a nasally voice says," You need to chang me bak fast, i don wans none of dem pewiads." Having no idea what that actually is she looks back to Eliran and gives him a thumbs up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina nods. "Well, get working on it. Before we have to re-examine the allowances of you living here rent-free."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"If this is going to take a while, can I get some clean clothes and a shower. I don't think the smell of pickle juice is helping anybody...."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

"Perhaps, with sufficient time and enough budget for research, your highness, I can find a cure for this troublesome predicament and restore your majesty to his-her original state." As Nokri spoke, his voice rose a few pitches. His hair that was doused in the pickle juice started to grow long again, and Nokri began regaining her feminine appearance. Though, only where the pickle juice had made contact.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina gasped, sprinting out of the room to locate Itory. "ITORY, ORDER 10 GALLONS OF PICKLE JUICE"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede goes silent and stiffens* ..."*Is it worth it*"

*maybe being a female isnt so bad*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Wear the pickle juice has touches Aldus's legs hair begins to grown back and his feet begin to return back to their normal size

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran thanked the lord that the pickle juice only got all over her gown.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*What would Yuria think of her new cute sister*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

The instant the princess ran out of the room, Nokri grabbed a pickle and tossed it with all her might at Aldus's chest.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran quickly leaped away from any pickle juice, still retaining her more nimble traits.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"what the?!" "You were just jealous I saw you staring!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"Is.. Tell me there's another way."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"no matter, my natural chest is just as glorious" Aldus says removing his pickle soaked shirt and wringing it out over now fully returns to his regular self

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Agreed"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

*Aldus looks at Eliran and then anywhere but*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"M-maybe I'll just go with you guys for a while to talk about finances... I dont think I can do this just yet." *Elfriede says shakening her head in disgust.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Wait w-what? Finances?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Uh-huh, well see my finances are pretty private so I can't let just anybody come with..." Eliran said kinda nervously, "Aldus we should go do that now. " she said, jerking her head towards the door.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

Nokri stood up, with half her original features back. "I was *not* staring." She looked at his chest again with a "hmmph." Her face was red but she blamed it on bowing down. "Where did the princess go? Did she mention giving me money for research? She's still gonna do that, right?"

"Elfriede, ask the princess about budget for more research on this. I, uh. We can get rich."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Itory, knowingly, ran a pickle bath for the princess, who disrobes in the bathroom and then hesitates. He had to admit, he liked the new power being male brought.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Yes, Finances are quite private indeed... although I am kinda gross right now, there is a guest bathroom yes?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede looks at Nokri, eye level at the moment due to her recent height, then smiles menacingly and whips out a pickle jar which he douses her with.* 
"Ya brat!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Upstairs and too the left" Eliran said

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"hmmm ya know I'm still getting used to the size of this place you should probably just show me"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-27*

"Eughh. *Hey!!* The [censored] was that for?" She kicked Elfriede between the knees, though in his current state it probably didn't hurt at all. "Me too. Show me a bath ASAP I'm revolted right now."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Sure thing, follow me," Eliran says, walking them too one of the baths, "Nokri feel free to bath here, Aldus you come with me to the next one."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"I'm sure you can find a vacant bath in one of the 6 bathrooms." *she folds her arms and smiles triumphantly.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina shrugs, princesses were prettier anyways, and sits in the pickle bath.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede passes the *pickle bath room* and almost retches right there. 
"UGH I can smell it from here!" she shouts through the door.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Don't you have to take a bath yourself!?" Afina, in her regular feminine voice, calls.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

As Eliran leads him down the hall he calls"why don't you just join her elfy? It'll be more bearable with company!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Plus we all know you want to show her something!" Eliran called back as well.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Hearing the familiar voice, her features loosen. Something about male Afina just rubbed her the wrong way.

*Her*... ugh... Elfriede hoped that the condition would just go away on its own; a bath in that Lyarlel tainted, gross liquid. Just imagining it getting into every small crevice and the smell never coming out. UGHHH.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Arriving at their destination, Eliran lead Aldus into the bath. The scene shifts to the hallway, with the door to the bath they went to in the center, Elirans head pops out and with a wink to the audience, she closes the door behind her. One can only imagine what occured next 😉

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

***What happens next may shock you***

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina drains the pickle juice, not running a regular bah for herself. She dumps a whole bottle of soap into the warm water, hoping the pickle juice smell doesn't stay too long.

Afina starts to hear noises through the wall and bangs on the adjacent wall with her fist. The noises continue nonetheless, and she sighs, getting out of the bath and wrapping a towel around herself. She pulls her hair up into a towel as well and proceeds down the hallway. Itory said the new shipment of pickle juice would not arrive for three days; hopefully Elfriede and Eliran would be able to hold out until then.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede watches her and Itory pass and hears the news*. To be honest shes not sure if she should be glad or upset. Somewhere in between maybe.

"Maybe I should start training to learn to fight with a smaller frame..."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

Adlus moans pleasurably as Eliran scrubs his long locks clean usings some method of head massage along with a heavenly smelling shampoo "I'm gonna....

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"You're really tense Aldus, you should relax more" Eliran said wrapped in a towl while she continues to wash Aldus's hair.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina hears Elfriede and peers into the room. "Elfriede? Bad news, no new pickle shipment for three days. Will you be able to stand being a girl a little longer?" Standing face to face, Afina is only slightly taller than Elfriede now.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede sighs* "I suppose... its not so bad.."

"Its unfortunate but I think I can manage... I might need to borrow ...some of your clothes though."

*Elfriede actually just thought Afina looks really cute in a lot of different outfits but felt weird asking her to try them on. Now she had an excuse.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Of course! We're the same size naturally. Almost." Afina says, pointing to Elfriede's chest with a grin.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede smiles excitedly and follows Afina with a spring in her step. If Afina meant offense it went right over her head*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

.... Be so clean ahhhh"he finishes relaxing his shoulders as the door pops open by itself

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

As Elfriede and Afina pass the door, Elfriede peeks in. "Ya know I learned a lot about finance in military prep school. I could join! I'm sure I'd be a big help!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Thats it, just like that aldus" Eliran said, "Just let yourself relax"

Eliran looks at the open door and the Elfriede peaking in, "Uh, sure thing Elfriede... Do you want to come in?"She said hesitantly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"Y-you're talking about finance n-now?!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"its good to do with a massage right? plus nobody interupts or listens in on the bathroom." Eliran said, trying to keep a straight face.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"Right Lady Afina?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Noticing Elfriedes still female form, Eliran had to ask, "Did you run out of pickle juice?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina, still wrapped in only a towel. "Uh, no thanks. I'll... I'll pass."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"Y-yeah.... hmm.. its a little weird but i'll be back after I get a change of clothes." *wow Eliran is so world smart, I didnt know that was a thing*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"And yes I regret to inform you we won't acquire pickle juice for another three days."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Three day???" Eliran said shocked. "I don't have clothes for three days... Afina!" Eliran said standing up with a glint in her eyes, also only in a towel, "We have to go shopping!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Huh!? No! I have all the outfits I need! Elfriede and I were about to go try them on!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran walked over and put an arm over Afina's shoulder, "Listen my Lady Afina, look at how adorable Elfriede is, _imagine_ how fun it would be to go to the shopping district in Theanovene, fashion capital of the world, and dress up in all the amazing clothes with her."

"Plus no offense, but your clothes wouldn't quite match Elfriedes aesthetic, you know it to be so."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina had to admit, Eliran as a girl was starting to weird her out. She hoped the pickle juice would get there sooner. Though she had to admit, Elfriede was pretty adorable. "Uhhh?? I..?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"all your wear is blue, elfriedes favorite color is purple won't work" Aldus says leaning back into the tub

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"I-...guess I could have used the same bath you did Afina.., but as if it wasnt *already* unsanitary."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Afina please. Plus we obviously don't have to go now, but later we definitely should." Eliran said, reasoning with her

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"But my current clothes are fine! AND custom made in Laera!" She whined.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

"Lezzz goooo!" *Elfriede starts tugging on her arm gently pulling her forward*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"We aren't shopping for you Afina, if you get clothes its an added bonus. This is for Elfriede." Eliran replied, "look at that face, how could you say no?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Curse these newfound feminine charms, at least when Elfriede was a boy, she could be confident that _she_ had the cuteness advantage. Elfriede has cute moments as a boy, but never carried the air of a cute person. Now, he didn't even have to try. "I... okay. Fine. Let me get clothes on," Afina resigns, wiggling out of their grasp to strut towards her own room.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"are we going shoppin?" Aldus pokes his head out of the bathroom

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Yes!" Eliran says excitedly, "now I just need some clothes..."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

"NOKRI, we're going shopping, come on Ill buy you something!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Follow me if you need feminine attire," Afina calls over her shoulder, nothing stopping the power walk to her room.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede sprints after her*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina threw open the closet doors, revealing rows and rows of tunics, dresses, gowns, cloaks, and every article of clothing one could want. Entirely in gray, black, and blue. Afina swiftly closed the closet doors to change herself, before emerging in her standard traveling attire. Gray tunic, blue cloak. As she pinned her family crest to the cloak, she began, "So Elfriede, what did you want to try on?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran runs down the hall to join the two.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede nods and smirks* Whatever you think we suite me Princess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina's eyes shimmer, and she runs to her closet once more. She throws out each article of clothing as she finds it. A blue top, black leggings, a long gray trench coat, a blue bow. "Elfriede please let me do your hair!" Afina is shocked by her own enthusiasm, but she never really _did_ have friends to do such things with when she was younger.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

Elfriede was strangely enthused by Afina's response. She grabbed up the clothing choices, donned them all and came out of the closet(lol). Elfriede did a twirl and then sat at the vanity waiting for Afina.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina had a wide range of hair and beauty products; her family may have sent her away to become "learned", but they spared no expense in reminding her of home. She started to brush Elfriede's hair with a silver brush, beaming with happiness. Her childhood self would be ecstatic.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran kinda sat as a third wheel, just looking through the clothes while those two did their thing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina calls over her shoulder cheerfully that Eliran can try on whatever clothing he wants to, humming to herself as she brushes through Elfriede's hair. If Elfriede stayed a girl, she could have the best friend she had always hoped for. That would almost make it worth it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran very carefully tries on several pieces of Afina's wardrobe, always feeling somewhat uncomfortable, her chest feeling just a little tight in most.  "Hey Afina..?" she called out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"Mmmmhm?" she asks, very carefully and artfully putting the bow in Elfriede's hair.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Do you have anything a little bigger but still fashionable? These all seem a little too tight on the chest."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

The rythmatic brushing feeling had Elfriede in an almost hypnotic state. He had never had long hair before this, but if it meant being groomed by Afina... hmm....

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina frowns. "It's not my fault you now have breasts proportional to your ego," she grinned. "I might. Try a dress with a lower cut."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Oh come on they're not _that_ big," Eliran said, deciding to join in with some self slander as she tried to figure out what to wear, "do you have anything in green? "

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina snorts, pulling the last detail into Elfriede's bow. "Of course not. Now Elfriede look!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran peers out from the wardrobe, "ooooo looking cute. Also was the "Of course not" about my ego, green clothes, or both?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina puts her hands on her hips, admiring the handiwork. "Definitely both."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Rolling her eyes,  "but of course, nothing less that blue for our princess." Eliran said, stepping out of the closet in what was probably Afina's lowest cut dress. It was a slender fit, perhaps because it was a little small, and unsurprisingly, it was blue, going down to her ankles. "does this make my butt look big?" She asked, looking over her shoulder. In all honesty the outfit was flattering, but with her hair looking a mess, Eliran looked a bit like a fish out of water

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Afina nodded, eyebrows raised. "Surprisingly, yes. Though your hair could use a loooot of work."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede looks to Eliran and smirks, as her hair was now beautiful~*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

Eliran blows the hair out of her face, "like I know what to do with my hair when its this long." She said, then squinting her eyes at elfriede, "hey get that smirk off your face, i get it your adorable and your flowing locks are unfairly beautiful."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

"If you could so graciously sit, I can see what to do about that lion's mane," Afina gestures to the edge of her bed.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-27*

*Elfriede pouts because its not her turn anymore and glares at Eliran*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-27*

"Thanks" Eliran says, quickly doing as told, noticing Elfriede's pout, she tried to console her, "don't worry, you can get your hair brushed as much as you want in a bit..." Then trying to think of something she could offer the knight, Eliran added, " if you come over here I can give you a good massage while she does my hair?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Elfriede contimplated it for a bit then nodded and plopped down in front of Eliran.

```
Location: Faun Beach Vacation home, beachfront
Characters: Yuria, Elfriede Faun, Afina, Eliran, Aldus, Atalantia, (Jerond Faun, Aria Faun)```

Elfriede sat sighing under an umbrella staring at everyone else having fun in the ocean. Yuria was playing volleyball with Eliran and Aldus... both on one team, the young lads surprisingly giving Yuria a run for her money. Nokri was blindfolded, swinging wildly at a watermelon that was now fourteen feet away while Atalantia laughed at her. 

Faun's parents seemingly quite out of character for them suggested this outing with friends as a type of "social training" for Elfriede considering how awkward he got in social situations. He'd never find a partner this way, and that simply wouldn't do in Eraia. 

Faun sighed again and glanced to his left. His parents, although uptight, clearly cared for each other a lot despite everything. Jerond massaged Aria's back while she ***glared at Elfriede***. He snapped his view swiftly away from his mother's judging gaze back to Yuria who had just spiked the ball down gaining another point. She turned to Elfriede and gave him a big thumbs up and smirked triumphantly. 

He then carefully glanced over his should at where Afina was also sitting under an umbrella several feet back reading with Itory standing guard.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina frowned at the sand collecting in her book's binding, pausing her studies to shake the the sand out of the book. Loose pages flew free from the old book, floating across the sand in the coastal breeze. Afina scrambled for the pages, grabbing as many as she could before finally giving up, sighing and returning to her umbrella with her crumpled papers. Maybe now wasn't the best time to study. Itory walked back to Afina, holding the remaining book components. The butler took the binding from her, reorienting the book. Afina looked over at the others, enjoying their time in the sunlight. The volleyball, the water, the watermelon smashing. Afina caught sight of Elfriede, also sitting alone, and managed a wave. She hoped he hadn't seen her mad dash for her destroyed book pieces.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

Eliran was enjoying the game of volleyball, until he earned a nice spike to the face when Yuria missed the ball.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

The sight of Eliran getting smacked in the face with the ball causes Aldus fall to  backward into the sand laughing.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Elfriede looked away when Afina looked toward him. He hoped that she hadn't caught him staring. He sprawled out in the sand under the umbrella, ughhhhhh he just wanted to do something he was used to, like training alone. Well. I guess he was alone... And kinda training for socially endeavors..? Ughhhhhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina lowered her hand awkwardly. He totally saw her scramble for those pages. Great. A sudden burst of laughter erupted from behind, and Afina turned to see Aldus collapsed on the floor laughing, clearly at Eliran's expense. Afina couldn't help but chuckle to herself too, standing up to check on her companions. The shade was a lonely place anyways. "What seems to have happened here?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

"I think Yuria just launched a hit single, at my expense..." Eliran said, groaning a little as a red shape of a hand started to appear on his face. While the man was hurt, he still had it in him to pun of course.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina had her arms folded, rolling her eyes to show that she clearly wasn't amused before offering him a hand. "Perhaps this is a good indicator that a break is needed. To the ocean?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

"Yes please" Aldus says wiping sweat from his forehead and  wrapping his hair up in a ponytail too keep it from getting too tangled in the water and  "Coming Elfriede?"  he says removing his shirt and  throwing it into the sand.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

"I think thats a good idea," Eliran said sitting up. "I'll join you in a second"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Elfriede sighed and rose. This is all part of his training. He had too do it, for his future. Elfriede dragging his feet slowly approached the group.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina nodded, walking back to her umbrella to remove her cover up. "Itory, please prepare me a towel," she nodded curtly, before stepping back into the sunlight. The cruel, harsh sunlight. Afina pushed the thought from her mind, reasoning that sunscreen would be enough to stave off a burn. She reached the water, and dipped a foot in. That was _freezing_. She turned back, about to argue against the idea, only to see both archer boys, and even Elfriede, approaching the water. She turned back to the freezing ocean, wading in ever so slowly. She was beginning to rethink this beach idea.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

Eliran noticed Afina's hesitation as he walked over, "whats wrong princess, to much sun for your delicate skin, or is the water to dirty." he called teasingly

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

Aldus steps int the water with ease "wow this waters really warm, nothing like the cold  streams and lakes back home" he casually walks into the water up to his waist.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

The corner of Afina's eye twitches and she reaches over to shove Eliran in. "You dummy!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

Eliran, seeing the shove coming tries to dodge, "hey watch it-" he starts, but instead of successfully dodging, he ends up pulling Afina down with him as they tumble into the waist deep water, both going under.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

"Eh... I don't like sand, it's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere...." After walking out into the sun, Elfriede's many small scars thay didn't hear fully showed all over his torso.

After seeing Afina get it he really felt like a wuss. "Ugh let's get this over with." He said as he lightly touched the water with his toes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina screeches as she's pulled under water, completely thrown off her feet. The two collide, and Afina pushes Eliran under further in an attempt to get air. Coughing and sputtering, she gets back to her feet, blonde hair hanging in her face. "You -cough- idiot! I could've -cough- died!" Afina turns to head back to her umbrella, only to be face to face with a very startled Elfriede. _Make that two embarassments to be witnessed today_ she mentally noted. "Come to -cough- enjoy the water?" she said, straightening her posture.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

Eliran, still underwater due to Afina pushing him deeper, and now standing on him, though she probably didn't notice cause she's to busy tryin to flirt, quietly ponders why these things always have to happen to him.

He then bursts out of the water to get air, cause shit bruh he ain't drowning today, promptly knocking Afina off her feet again. Coughing, he splutters out, "What -coughs- the hell?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Everything happened in slow motion for Afina. Eliran emerged from the watery depths. She was promptly thrown backwards. Elfriede's face somehow became even _more_ shocked. And with a grim finality, Afina landed on her butt in the water. "What the hell _me_!? What the hell _you_!!" Had the light mage been carrying her book, Eliran would've promptly been blasted. Afina suddenly remembered Elfriede's presence as he shifted awkwardly. _Now three embarassments_ Afina thought in shame.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

Aldus watches the entire spectical with a raised eyebrow, feeling like he's watching children, and   thankful they are not at a public beach.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

"I wasn't the one trying to shove somebody underwater, and then decided to stand on them to keep them there!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Elfriede was standing there stunned at Eliran and Afina scrambling to no be submerged. The water was indeed a scary place. Then gets splattered with water as Afina finally surfaces. He goes to bend down to help her up when her head whips around to stop close to his face.
Time froze for a moment as his face went flush and he instinctively backed up. Afina then asked if he was coming to the water.

He started to stumble over words went Eliran violently emerged from behind her which really started Elfriede. He could tell she was embarrassed but so we he. As Afina and Eliran began arguing he glanced around to Yuria who was staring at him smiling and giving him a thumbs up.

What could she be..? He glanced back down to Afina who just fell on her bum. A-ahh.

Elfriede suddenly splashed into the water to hide his face.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina's jaw dropped as Elfriede ducked into the water. That was it. Three embarrassing strikes against her and he was hiding. Afina tackled Eliran, a fire clearly in her eyes. "Itory, my book!" She yelled. Itory, privy to this scene many times before, ignored the request, instead focusing on his quest to find the perfect coconut.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

"but wouldn't that... Ruin the book?" Aldus says out loud but doesn't expect a response. Aldus looks up, meeting eyes with Yuria who seems almost equally entertained with all this and shakes his head in response to the actions of the other three. "Wonder when he'll come back up...."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

With a nice _oof_ sound Eliran takes Afina's tackle like a champ, "You're gonna have to try harder than that to beat me" he said, pushing Afina backwards to get some space, but not enough to send her underwater or tumbling again. "Take this!" He called as he used his arm to create a large splash of water in Afinas direction. Cleary this was a common occurence between the two of them at the beach.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina begins to search for Elfriede in the water, before a wave of water is splashed in her face. She coughs as more water fills her lungs. "What are you, a child?" She calls, splashing him back.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Elfriede emerged behind Eliran coughing and spuddering, he hadn't swam much in training despite being close to the ocean. Ugh...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

"At least I'm not threatening people with a magic bo-" Eliran started, getting cut off by a large splash from Afina, with some residual probably hitting the Faun behind him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Afina inhales sharply as some of her splash gets on Elfriede. "I'm Eliran, I love women and hurr durr here's me lute," Afina mocks, hands on her hips.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

Eliran squints his eyes, "how dare, you _know_ I love men AND women." And it was in that moment, this was no longer a game (except it 100% was totally a game) Eliran took both arms, spread them wide, and brought down to large splashes of water in Afinas direction.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Elfriede getting continually splashed by stray fire looked onward to Yuria in defeat. She smirked and started sprinting towards the group at a crazy speed. She jumped in the air to cannonball near everyone.
"Oh no."
 Elfriede dove under, he figured he'd be more likely to survive *under* the water.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

"Wha-?" Afina manages, before she sees a flash of brown hair and she is entirely consumed in a wave. Sputtering and coughing, she wipes her eyes. That was too energetic to Elfriede so it must've been... Yuria? The fearless woman resurfaces, and anyone looking closely could see the corner of Afina's eye twitch ever so slightly. Yuria was cool and confident; Afina didn't want to admit that she was jealous.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

The only warning Eliran had was the quiet "oh no" of Elfriede behind him.  By the time he could begin to think "Oh no what" it was already to late and Yuria landed her cannonball right by him. Getting hit by the full brunt of the cannonballs wave, Eliran knew it was no longer time to focus on small fry, a new enemy had entered the battlefield, an enemy who had struck him once before.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-10*

Elfriede emerges again after the huge wave passed over. It was huge. How is she so cool ?!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Afina pushed the hair out of her eyes. It. Was. ON. "Itory, my book!" Afina barked again, trudging through the water towards the coastline. The others in the water gave her puzzled looks, until she emerged on a large rock nearby. "I'm the queen on the rock so your tiny splashes cannot compare with me!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-10*

Elfriede glanced up at Afina and back down to Yuria. These two strong personalities coming together, anything could happen. What if she challenged Yuria... On no,
"M-MAYBE WE SHOULD HEAD INSIDE AND DRY OFF A-AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT AFINA." He needed to save her.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Eliran dunked Elfriede as soon as he heard the words 'head inside'. 
"Oh no you don't Faun, this is what the beach is all about! King (or Queen) of the hill!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

"Muahaha no one dares to challenge me!" Afina cackled, waving a palm frond in the air.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

"Don't be so certain, Aldus! come with me real quick!" Eliran barked, grabbing Aldus and dragging him to shore.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

"Do you BOYS really think you can take ME?" Afina cackled, pointing her palm frond scepter at Eliran.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

"Just you wait Princess, never doubt the Bow Brothers!" He yelled back, now on the beach, rummaging through his bag

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

Aldus had simply been talking in the scene, admused at the energy and friendly competition. A firm grip on his wrist snaps him out of his trance. As Eliran begins to pull him to the shore Aldus chuckles "Whoa what are we doing now? What do you have in there" he asks cocking his head, honsetly curious as to what Eliran could have brought to the beach.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

"These!" Eliran says triumphantly, pulling out a pair of odd bow-like contraptions and a bag of what could be considered Early water balloons.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

"Are those sling shots?!" Adlus exclaims excitedly, nostalgia bubbling up with in him. He takes one of the slingshots and one if the balloons and takes aim at Afina. "I haven't used a sling shot in years but I used to be quite good at it." He brags while firing

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

"Exaclty, these are our way to claim the Rock for ourselves!" Eliran said excited, loading a two bags of water balloons and passing one to Aldus, "Here take your ammo!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-10*

Elfriede crawls to shore 20 feet north of where the challenge was taking place looking eye to eye with his mother.
He felt the disapointed stare weighing on him. Ugh... mother please have mercy.... I cant just instantly woo someone with the social powers that he doesnt possess. Besides...
Elfriede glances back the the party all pelting eachother with water.

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

*(ooc: Just to add the the 'aurii is rwby' meme, this is the food fight.)*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-10*

Suddenly Yuria is picks him up off the ground from behind, places him on the ground and whispers in his ear, 
"You might want to go join them... Knight lieutenant. " She lightly shoves him towards the group, "Just leave the two pretty one's faces alone." she said with a wink.

Shivers went down his spine as he went to rejoin the main group. What... did she mean by that?

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

"That rock is a good as ours!" He says taking his share of the balloons before calling out to Afina "You won't be standing there for long Princess!" And firing another water balloon in her direction

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Afina manages to dodge the first balloon, even smacking away the second with her palm frond. A final third balloon hits her in the chest and Afina sinks to her knees. "Curse you nefarious hoodlums..." she says, shaking her fist. "Little did you know, I have back up! Elfriede!" She tosses the palm frond to him. "Defend my honor!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-10*

Elfriede reaches down suddenly in "combat mode" and grabs a conch in his off hand while catching the frond in his main hand, holding it as he would a rapier.
"Lady Afina, I'll remove these vagabonds from your sight." 
Instead of engaging he sort of awkwardly half circles around the 2, waiting for them to make a move. Faun 's face looked way too serious.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

"Who are you fooling Elfriede? Do you really think you can beat us?" Aldus respostions himself so that he is back to back with Eliran ensuring they are covered in all the sides as he readies up two balloons at once flinging both in Elfriede's direction.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Eliran stood back to back with Aldus, "use the balloons to force him closer to the rock" He said, as he too unleashed a couple of balloons toward Elfriede.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Afina, feeling rather useless in this new confrontation, summons Itory to bring her the bottle of sunscreen. The butler obliges and Afina pops off the cap, aiming at the two boys in the water. "Hey! Dummies!" She says, trying to create an opening for Elfriede. "I'm aiming for your eyes!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Noticing Afina's new assault, Eliran called out, "Aldus, you focus on the sword, I'm going for the head." before quickly diving underwater to avoid the sunscreen.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

Aldus continues his assault Elfriede not letting upwhile putting himself low in a defensive posture in case the princess should make good on her word.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Having left the laguz to battle it out, Eliran swam closer to afina, popping up every now and then to launch a couple Balloons at the princess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Afina gasps. "Yuria do you need help keeping your top from exposing yourself!?" She calls, feigning that the strong woman needed assistance. Maybe that would fool Eliran. She took a shot at his face.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Eliran blocked it by raising both arms to cover himself, "Ha! As if she of all people would have problems with that!" He said, though if somebody was paying close attention they would have noticed he kinda did check behind him while covering his face from the attack.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-10*

Elfriede was agressively ducking and and deflecting waterballoons and not getting anywhere. When Afina said the line about Yuria, he paused for a second confused and shocked. "W-what? no. Yuria would never-- UPHM "Elfriede got pegged in the face with a  water balloon. He stared at Aldus unamused and grimaced.

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*



**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

T'was opposite day
and all through the realm
personalities changed
and people got overwhelm~~ed~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina sits up straight at her desk, pausing halfway through reading her book. "Well this is shitty," she says, pushing her chair away from the desk. Grabbing a decorative sword off its mount on the wall, she spins it. "Hey anyone down to spar?" She yells into the hallway.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

Nokri felt oddly refreshed all of a sudden. Her mood was great, amazing even. She considered bursting into song. It was as though every bad bone left her body. The feeling was so profound she decided that everyone should feel this way, and was resolved to help everybody feel just as wonderful.

Hearing a voice in the hallway that magically connects everybody, she went to investigate who it was. *Oh... Afina.* Normally Nokri would be on hands and knees, grovelling before somebody of Royalty and doing her utmost to befriend the princess, but today... Nokri really didn't care. In fact she felt almost a twinge of contempt for the royal. "Careful with that," she started, backing away from the sword. "You could poke someone's eye out! That would hurt quite a lot."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina turns abruptly, swinging the sword with her. "You! I challenge you to a duel! To. THE. DEATH." She laughs wildly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

"ugh, could you keep it down" Aldus saying entering the room. Ever since hes woken up this morning hes just been so *annoyed* at every thing, and everyone. "What are you, batshit?" he says to Afina rolling his eyes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Ah finally! A respectable laguz to battle. You, sir, I challenge you to battle as well!" She yells, pointing the sword in his face. "Why would we fight with words or magic, when we have weapons and fists!"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

Cowering, Nokri thought bravely of a way to diffuse the situation. When suddenly, "Aldus! Oh thank goodness, I'm so glad to see you! Could you please help me calm her down?" But rather than that, it seems the situation escalated. "Oh dear, I *said* that could be dangerous! What about the property damage, even?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Dishevelled Elfriede walks into the room, Tail out, armour off, "your all making too much noise! I have a hangover!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-31*

Eliran, behind Afina, cowers somewhat "p-p-please put that down princess" he requests in earnest.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

"UGH" Aldus moves Afina's sword to the side and walks past her, unaffected buy the threat. "SHUT UP!"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

With her hands up trying to think of a way to calm everyone down, Nokri heard Elfriede's arrival. "Oh, are you alright? Do you want some water? It's best to stay hydrated with a hangover." Turning back to the others, she gasped, "Aldus!! Are you okay? You're never like this, and look how scared Eliran. Did the sword cut your hand?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Oh. My. God. Elfriede nobody cares about your problems. Stop being such a drunk, why don't you actually care about your duty for once?" Afina demands, before turning to Eliran, dropping the sword. "Little brother!" She throws her arms around his neck. "Glad to see you awake!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-31*

Eliran was to timid to correct her, and frankly to startled by the hug. He never could get used to her way of breaching social hierarchy in like this, "G-good morning my lady." He stammered

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Ah drop the 'my lady' Eli, you know that's way too formal!" She punches him in the shoulder. "Loosen up!"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

Aldus thinks id he rolls his eyes anymore he'll hurt his eyes"Ugh Im getting out of here..." Aldus walks out of the room and down the hall

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede slaps Eliran's back,
" Aahhhhhh loosen up kiddo! "

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-31*

Eliran gives a slight, startled 'ow'. Whether it was Afina or Elfriedes hit that caused it, nobody knows

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Aaaanyways," Afina says, stooping over to grab the sword. "Who finally agreed to duel against someone of my fighting prowess!?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

Hearing an exclamation usually associated with pain, Nokri whirled around. "Eliran, you alright? Are you in pain somewhere, let me see." She went to step closer but noticed the princess going for her sword again and halted, cautious of any sudden movements.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina smirks, "so who's gonna duel me? no ones ever wanted to go against a _princess_." She wiggles her eyebrows. "You know you want tooo"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran looked to nokri, "n-no I'm just ok it's nothing a-at all" he says, trying to seem a bit tough.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

"Eliran!" Afina exclaims, temporarily forgetting his presence. She gets in close to his face. "I know you're a prude and all, but do YOU want to duel?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran jumps at her exclamation with a little yelp. "My lady I r-really shouldn't. If your father found out."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

"Dad doesn't find out, what I don't write in the letters," she grins. "Come on, you need to flex your masculinity once in a while, right?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran pauses " nobody knows..?" He asks hesitantly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

"No one." she nods, shoving the sword into his hands. "Now come on!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Having the sword suddenly shoved info his hands Eliran stumbles back a little, fumbling with the weapon, "s-shouldn't we be using training weapons??" He asked startled

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina's eyes flash with excitement. "Training weapons are for losers."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran looks to Elfriede and mouths the words "help me"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina scrunches her eyebrows. "What did you say?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

"n-nothing" Eliran says innocently

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Despite their height difference, Afina grabs him by the collar. "Were you talking crap about the Tyndall name, Cantaret?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-05*

"By Lylalels tits put the kid down. Your racket is giving me a headache."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

"My lady I would never. The Tyndalls have been my benefactors forever" Eliran responds with his hands up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

"MY racket?" Afina asks incredulously, shoving Eliran away. "Um, why don't we address you awful drinking habits?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran falls on his ass.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-05*

"Listen *little lady* I'll drink if I want to drink. And the Tyndalls have been nothing but con artists from the start." Elfriede scoffs.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

"How about you stop squandering your furball-fondling family's money by being the worst excuse for a knight. EVER," Afina laughs. "At least the Tyndalls have contributed to their country. No better warfare tactics have come from anywhere but the Tyndall home."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-05*

Elfriede grits his teeth. "Please. I dont wanna hear any more from the Harlot of Light Magic. Any family thats as rich is your is making thier money of someone. Somewhere someone is getting screwed. I'll be willing to bet you get breakfast brought to you every morning from your butler Willington and dont have to worry about *any* responsiblilities. Your kind doesnt know what its like to serve in the military or *hic* work hard..."
As he rambles on his voice gets less and less enthused.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina steps closer to Elfriede; thankfully, they're of similar height, so doing so puts them at eye level. "Just because I'm a princess doesn't mean I have a comfortable lifestyle. At least I don't insult my family name like _someone_. Do you care about anyone but yourself?" she folds her arms.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

_talk about the pot calling the kettle black_ Eliran thinks to himself

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-05*

"Yeah I DO. My older sister looks up for em to set an example. She's always struggled in life, I do everything for *her*. Meanwhile you rag on this kid for no good reason *(even though hes older then him)*."

He moves closer as well. "What do you have to say for yourself *Princess.*"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

"_Right_ because providing for your incompetant sister makes you _such_ a saint. And I haven't hurt a single hair on Eliran's head, right Eliran? I may not care about my kingdom, but at least I have a cause to throw my weight behind. The laguz have seen mercy and help from me at every opportunity. And you? You bum off your military assignment of protecting me so that you have free lodging and alcohol."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-05*

Elfriede gimaces and about-faces. "Pfft whatever, you still love me." 

He starts walking away.
 "I'm going back to bed princess.... sorry buddy." He says as he stops at the pantry to grab another bottle of wine.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina purses her lips, turning her back to Elfriede. "He's correct, and lucky that I have a long fuse, otherwise his ass would've been toast."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-05*

Elfriede scoffs lightly and walks upstairs. He very loudly walks over to the part of the house Afina's room is and falls asleep on her bed making sure she heard it the whole way. *Anything to get under her skin.* He smirked at himself as he poured a glass, put it on the night stand and passsed out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

Afina glances up as the floorboards above her head shake and shutter. _Of course he sleeps in my room_, she thinks. _It's not like the damn cuddler knows anywhere else_. If he spilled alcohol in her bed though, she would kill him.

"Well, now that he's taken care of, as lady of the house, I will promptly ignore the needs of any of my guests, find lunch for yourselves."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran sighs, puts his sword down and goes to his own room to take a nap cause fuck this shit
