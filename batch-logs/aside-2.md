**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-04*

"Excuse me," she says to the young man with the sword, "do you have business with this tower as well?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-04*

*Elfriede Glances over and sees that the person that approached him was a female lagu.*
*He shifts a bit uncomfortably for he doesn't have a lot of experience dealing with laguz.*
"I-Indeed, I am here as a courier... nothing more."
*He glances back at the door*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-04*

*She notices how uncomfortable he was with the small stutter and stiffening posture. Perfect*

*She grabs the boy by the arm.*

"Ah, then perhaps we are bounded by fate, for I too need to meet with the lady of this tower."

*She pulls away, rubbing his arm down to the hand as she prepared to curtsie.*

"You may call me K, a young maiden from Callorian. And you?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-04*

*Elfriede's face noticeably flushes but he quickly shakes it off*

I-I am Elfriede Faun, ... of Eraia. 

*he uncomfortably glances down*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-04*

*She raised her pose and gave a smirk.*

"It is a pleasure to meet you Elfriede. It's uncommon to see a knight do a courier, even if they are so young."

"Are you a new recruit?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-04*

"Indeed." *Elfriede nods in agreement* "A pleasure"
*Looks slightly offended and raises an eyebrow*
"Although I am no new recruit, I am a knight lieutenant."

*He Glances back to the door and awaits a response to his knock from within*
"As for why they sent a Knight to do this job, well....If you will excuse me maiden I must find out what *that* is all about"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-04*

"Allow me to join you."

*She says, quickly grabbing his hands.*
"After all, no lieutenant would leave a lady alone. Especially when their destinations meet."

(ooc: Atalantia then appears?)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-15*

*Elfriede is slightly pushed aside and away by a much larger Lagu female*
*Immediately looks disgruntled*
(Why are there so many Laguz here..)

(*enter round 2*)

```Location: Bandit Trail, near Eraia Border
Asided from: Woods cabin
Characters: Afina, Elfriede, Kailyn, Atalantia```

*Elfriede sits off to the side in the woods Grumbling about how the group cant even work togethor long enough to open a door*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-15*

*Although it was only said once, Kailyn feels that Afina has been talking about an attack word for weeks.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-15*

"So?" Afina demands, hands on her hips. "No one here seems to know the value of a contingency plan! What's our signal phrase!?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-15*

*Twice.*

"We can simply say attack or help. I don't think a phrase would be so useful when we are close. Anyone who is prepared to attack should be ready."

Kailyn continues, "Also, I think if we are being grappled, pinned, thrown, or attacked it should be obvious we need help."

(*Atalantia says something about wanting to knock on door and talk to the people in the cabin. No weapons should be used unless the people in the cabin  pose threat. The rest of team can hide and ambush if violence occur, but as last resort.*)

(ooc: Gotchu fam)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-15*

"And if we want to launch a pre-emptive attack? What if us in the forest notice something before you do? Do we attack while you still pursue diplomacy?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-15*

"If the people outside do notice something that the people inside don't, they should come to their aid, or at least prevent whatever mischief would occur."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-15*

Afina exhales with exasperation. "Im not predominantly a fighter, you know. I don't trust that there won't be at least one bandit with an itchy dagger hand. I don't trust this plan, and I only barely accept it"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-15*

*Elfriede's eyebrow twitches*

*its difficult getting on his nerves but this new crew is starting to push the limits*

"Can we please decide on something, we already took this detour I dont want to be even later then we originally planned. We're taking enough time as it is."

**lapost48** - *2017-11-15*

Atalantia says something along the line of, "You are jumping to the conclusion that these are bandits"

(ooc: I'll speak for the alpha female of the group)

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-15*

*Kailyn sighs*

"How about this, Atalantia and I will knock on their door while Elfriede and  Afina will be around the windows. You can easily come in case anything bad happens. However, until they attack us or we believe they are guilty and refuse to come then we will **apprehend** them. Sounds fair?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-16*

Afina raised her eyebrows. "And the attack phrase is...?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-16*

*Thrice.*

**lapost48** - *2017-11-16*

"As the Laguz of the group, K and I are less likely to startle them. We will knock on the door and speak to the people inside." Atalantia turns to Elfeiede, "Set a perimeter and ensure no one interrupts us. I leave the princess's safety in your hands. The attack phrase can be 'Help!' "

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-16*

(ooc: Do we know he is a laguz?)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-16*

(ooc: nah)

*elfriedes nods and sighs again*

"At last some order?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-16*

(retcon:
"As the alpha male of this group-"
"I'm the only man."
"As the alpha male of this group...")

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-16*

Afina nods, finally content to have an established plan. "Finally, something I can agree to. I trust you both to keep tensions from escalating as much as possible. And, in the worst case scenario, we attack."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-16*

*Kailyn smiles.*

"I think we finally have some cohesion in this group."

(ooc: Everyone jumps in the air and freeze frame)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-16*

"Yes of course." *Elfriede nods*

"Let's be done with it."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-11-16*

[END ASIDE]

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

```Location: Bandit hideout boss room, near Eraia Border
Characters: Elfriede, Atalantia
 ```

Elfriede glances to Atalantia circling the Laguz leader and smiles disarmingly.

"I understand your pain, and I respect what you are saying, but please don't let your pride for your race blind you into risking your life for the final blow. We should focus on doing what's right together."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

Atalantia looks Elfriede in the eye with a serious expression, "We will be fighting this battle together. I just wish to be the one to conclude this fight. 
This isn't just a matter of pride for my race. It's a test for myself. A test to determine my strength in this world."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

Elfriede sighs.

"I'm only worried that this foolishness will only end in your injury. I will respect your wishes but I certainly disagree."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

Atalantia shakes her head. 
"I am not afraid of my own injuries, if anything I'm still worried about your own. It hasn't been very long since you've sustained brutal wounds, I'd rather not see you take more on behalf of my stubbornness. 
Besides, as a leader and warrior I am more than capable of surviving. You have seen the damage I can do in order to survive on my own..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-15*

Afina pauses, the light from her hand fading as her head cocked in confusion. For once, she had been willing to collaborate, for the sake of ending the first. But now _these two_ had to bicker? Afina scowled, a burst of light shimmering on her face one more, containing the laguz leader in captivity with her light spells. If they didn't finish their quarreling soon, she would finish the job herself.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

"Yes, and I respect your strength. Just in the military we are taught to not let personal glory get in the way of the end goal." 

Elfriede eyed Atalantia and nodded respectfully.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

Atalantia is taken back by Elfriede's statement, "If you don't fight for your own personal goals, then what is the reason you have for fighting?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

Elfriede pauses awkwardly. It's something he thinks about often but being asked outright really threw him off. 

"... My family name and my duty to... My country."

He seemed unsure about the latter.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

"So you too fight for some sort of pride.
It is my duty to MY people to defeat the laguz bandits, in order to stop them from ruining our people's reputation. And it is a duty to myself, to finish what I have started."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

Elfriede paused for a moment to think over her reasoning. 

"I can't say I fully understand, what if we were to arrest her instead? Then there would be no final blow."

He shook his head in defeat. The culture difference ran too deeply. Is this what his family came from before Eraia? You would have never have guessed looking at the Faun family from the outside.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-15*

Afina took a moment to glare at the two of them. _Hurry up_, she thought. She didn't want to hold position of the same light spell _forever_.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

Atalantia noticed Elfriede's puzzled face. 
"I'm afraid arresting Rica would do nothing for us. I've given her plenty of chances to end her crimes before I engaged in the battle for survival. Therefore, a final blow would be best."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

Elfriede just agreed to disagree.

"I guess this battle will lay where it falls."

Elfriede said softly as he slowly began an approach of the heavy axe wielding woman.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

Atalantia gets filled with even more fiery conviction to the point where one could almost feel the heat radiating from Atalantia. Ignorance was one thing, but She didn't seem to appreciate the fact that Elfriede would not allow her to finish the battle that was rightfully hers.
She steps forward and begins to flank Rica with Elfriede. 
"NO. I will be the one to finish this battle. I've survived this long on my own, it should be the least you can do in order to pay respect to that fact."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

"We still have yet to defeat her in the slightest, let's get passed *that* first."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

"oh I will defeat her, especially with your support"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

[end aside at the sound of Elfriede's sighing]

```Location: Eraian Theanovene Border Station
Asided from: Medical room
Characters: Elfriede Faun, Atalantia Enneka, Afina Tyndall```

Elfriede awoke from a vivid nightmare… then realized it wasn't a nightmare. He recalled being hit hard in the gut with a horizontal slash backwards into a wall then slipping from consciousness slowly. The last thing he remembered was the axe flying for..! He shot up to glance around to find *her* and felt a throbbing pain in his stomach which caused him to double back over. 

“Ach..!” Elfriede winced harshly at the pain; the wound was closed thanks to healing magic but the pain still lingered for the moment. He slowly looked up and around the room. His eyes first stopping at Atalantia staring out the window. She looked at him and he offered a smile back. He was glad she was alright, she had taken some decent wounds if he recalled, but here she was looking as if she had barely fought. *Narder does good work.* He turned to his right to see a ball under the covers in the next bed and he sighed lightly.

“Thank Lylalel.”

 It was already midday. The sky was clearly overcast as there were no shadows. A perfect gloomy day after their grim fight, but it felt almost peaceful.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-26*

Atalantia stared outside the medical room's window and admired the blissful rays of sunlight that shone down on the world. 
While in the hideout, Atalantia did not know whether or not she would be able to see the light of day again. In fact, just a few hours ago that she had to fight for her life against those criminals. Despite this fact, the overall fight seemed like a distant memory... specifically a memory that occurred all too fast.

Atalantia's ears perk up to the sound of Elfriede moving. As she turned to face him, she made sure to put on a smile, but she hid back the guilt she felt for allowing him to get hurt. At the same time, Atalantia looked towards Afina who also got hurt trying to assist her.

Atalantia only wished that her friends would understand why she had to do what she did. And that both of them would fully accept her as an ally and friend.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

A dull soreness seeping into Afina’s leg wakes her begrudgingly. With a groan, she opens her eyes, anticipating a warm meal and Itory to be waiting for her. Instead, she sees her travelling companions. With a start, she looks down at her torso, hands feeling through her gown for an injury that was no longer there. Her tense shoulders slump in relief, seeing her travelling clothes folded up with her travel pack at the end of her bed. _That’s far too much blood_ she notes, mentally calculating just how much it would cost to repair her clothes, custom sewn in Callora. Perhaps she would be better off doing so herself. 

Noticing Elfriede and Atalantia, she nods in acknowledgement. “Good morning,” she says. “I do believe we must have slept well, as last I saw, it was night.” She laughs lightly at the pleasantry. “Did we… win?” she asks hesitantly, remembering her last glimpse of battle was a battle axe flying towards her.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

Elfriede closes his eyes and recalls the dangers of last night. The blood, the chaos, everyones injuries, ... and Rica's final retreat before unconsciousness.

".. No.. but I wouldn't say we lost either. She has been hurt and pushed back, the compound will be cleared by Ransford's platoon, as is protocol." he thinks for a brief moment and smiles. "The path will be safe for a time, until Rica can regroup and heal; even so coming back hear would be too dangerous. She'll have to move."

Again Elfriede locks eyes with each of his companions.
He felt much closer to them in that moment. He would hate to see either of them go... which was unusual for him. Faun wasn't sure what to make of it, but he would enjoy their further travels together. 

"I'm glad you are both alright."

Elfriede scoots the the end of the bed painfully and sees his traveling gear on a nearby end table.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Afina folds her hands in her lap. “I'm unsurprised. Out battle strategy was a tactical nightmare. Its a credit to ourselves and the commander that we accomplished as much as we did.” 
_Well, more like ***you*** accomplished as much as we did_ she thought. Though her light magic had been proficient enough to hold a line, she stood no match in one-on-one conflict. Afina resolved to improve the use of her dagger. Or perhaps either of the two with her would share their strategies of swordsmanship. Her father used a sword, perhaps it was a viable weapon. 
“I'm pleased to see that you are both also doing well; it seemed that the bandit leader was not the only one horribly injured. Though thanks to… Narder I believe was his name. We should be fit to travel again soon.” Afina made another mental note to ask Narder for medicinal advice. This battle was lost because her enemy had more knowledge in attack. She would surely have to compensate in turn for a possible next skirmish. 
“Has anyone spoken to the commander?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

Elfriede lifts up his shirt to look at his injury, the skin was discolored slightly where the axe had dug in. He stood up and very slowly stretched his abs by bending back and twisting. They still hurt *pretty bad*.

"I just awoke as well. However, if memory serves he's probably recovering just as much as us. I'm still in a decent amount of pain but if we are just traveling I think I can make due. We can head out whenever you are ready Lady Afina. The pain should dissipate throughout the day." He paused for a moment and eyed the amount of blood staining their clothes yet again; mostly their own this time. "..and yourselves? how are you two holding up?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

“I am well.” Afina replied tersely. Though she wore leggings with her gown, she dared not lift the fabric to survey her healing. Most of all, it would be highly uncouth for a princess to bare her skin to professional company such as hers. But Afina was more troubled by her own personal reasons. The thin line of a healed wound would remind her of her failure in combat, and not all such scars were recent. 
“Though I would like to continue on our journey as soon as possible to expedite the mission… if our company shall have us, a day of rest is in order. Even the most proficient of mages need study time. My motion is that we appeal to the commander’s lighter nature; perhaps he shall grant us stay another night. Alternatively. The accommodations here are quite barbaric. Perhaps there is a nearby inn?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

"We of course could travel to the nearest inn. Unfortunately I believe that It is indeed in the opposite direction... The one along our way is over a day's travel. We'd have to camp unless we paid for passage." The knight stretches again, desperately trying to ignore his screaming nerves as his abs flexed. He winces a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Afina pulls the covers off her legs, swinging her feet out to the ground. The floor feels cold under her bare feet, and she pushes herself off the bed with a grunt of strain. She picks up her dress to examine it, noting the shredded fabric and rust-colored blood. _Yes, she would most definitely like some time to repair her garments_, she thought.  "I supposed we are at the mercy of the garrison's hospitality then," she said with pursed lips, still examining her clothes.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-26*

Atalantia looks towards her friends and responds to all their questions and greetings. "Good morning to all of you as well. I'm glad you both have awoken, and I am very greatful that both of you had returned to the hideout in order to find me. There's no telling what situation I'd be in without the two of you.

While we did not defeat Rica entirely, she did give us the honor of taking the win, and acknowledge our skills as valiant warriors. 

I also believe that we should try to find an inn to stay at during our travels. None of us are at full strength, so taking chances would be foolish."

Atalantia then looks towards the window once more. 
"If we are choosing to stay another night at this garrison, I would very much like to try and train. I couldn't bare seeing you both become more hurt than you already are..."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

"Agreed.." 

Faun's eyes went from his borrowed clothes he is wearing, Afina's unusually drab gown  for a women of her tastes, and Atalantia's revealing torn tunic. The princess's less then flattering clothing almost aggravated him. He wasn't sure why, it just didn't feel *right*. And Atalantia, well... there were more pressing issues as to why she would need to see to her wardrobe.

Not to mention that the clothes that he wore barely fit him, they were way to large, made for a bigger man then he. The pants were only staying up due to a tight belt.

"We should Probably... repair and wash these while we're here the best we can. I'm sure we can pay for any materials we use in the barracks."

"We can set out early tomorrow morning as long as Ransford will have us for the night." 

Elfriede walked over to his clothes and grabbed his shirt and held it up and eyed the blood and the small cuts. *I'm going to need some of that mix that Narder washed us with earlier...*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-26*

Atalantia's face began to blush as she noticed Elfriede observing her torn clothes. Her clothing was in such a mangled state that one would probably assume they were rags rather than the tribal and high standing leader attire she once worse. Although despite her disheveled appearance, Atalantia didn't give much thought to her appearance till now, but was still a bit ashamed to say the least.

"I-I'm afraid my clothes are beyond the ability to be repaired. Would the garrisson have new clothes that I could use, until I'm able to buy more?" Atalantia said with a bit of a stutter, rather than her typical clear and strong tone.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

"Most likely. Here take this until we talk to Ransford about purchasing some from him. It's too big for me anyways." 

Faun changes back into his stained shirt and throws her the one he had on. 

"I know its not great, but its all we have until we find somewhere we can buy better clothes. Or my family home in Lyall. Probably a travelling trader in Effera two to three days south of here will have what we need. It's a sort of hub for traders from Theonovane."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-26*

"Thank you..." Atalantia says towards Elfriede while looking towards the ground attempting to hide her blushed face. It wasn't like her to accept such things from others. Usually people in her tribe would fend for themselves, or share necessities with the young such as food.

 "Hopefully I can find something similar to my tribal clothes if we shop in Effera....." Atalantia says with clear disappointment in her voice. Her clothes were a remaining symbol of her tribal family, and her strength as a leader.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Afina glances between the two of her companions, then back down at her own clothes, not quite grasping the situation. Whatever it was, she felt awkward. She cleared her throat. "I do believe my father could send extra clothes by courier, if given a destination. Perhaps to the Faun residence, if your family would be so kind, Elfriede." Afina gathered up her clothes in her arms, careful to make sure the silver pin bearing her family crest was still secured to her cloak. "Though my family would not have your measurements offhand, we could still clothe you in the best Callora has to offer. We'll need proper clothing for the route; there's no doubt we'll run into more hostile laguz."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

Elfriede nods at Atalantia, "I'm sure we can in Lyall if not Effera."

Faun then turns to Afina.

"I'd think that its probably more likely that we'd run into Drecan patrols than Laguz considering what we've accomplished. And yes that would be quite fine, I'll have clothing already there for me so no need, but in the mean time I think we should definitely purchase some goods and temporary garments in Effera."

Elfriede holds out his hand to offer Afina to get out of bed and smiles. "We still have a long journey ahead of us; let us make the most out of today to prepare Lady Tyndall."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Afina accepts Elfriede's polite offer of assistance, smirking with an air that only a princess could carry. "Naturally this is the case. I myself must find some food and speak with the commander, I believe. Though afterwards, I request that we train together today; I feel it would be most beneficial for ourselves, as well as our teamwork."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-26*

"Yes, training and making use of this day for recovery would be best. I hope we all become very good friends and allies." Atalantia nods towards her friends.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-26*

"Agreed and as do I." Elfriede nods approvingly and excitement flows through him. He cannot wait. He never realized it, but adventuring with friends excited him. Even if this was to only be a temporary mission and they parted ways, he hoped that this relationship would last.

[End aside]

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

```
Characters: Elfriede and Afina 
Setting: Eraian Military Outpost- Medical Ward ```

As Atalantia left to be occupied with her own affairs, Afina closed her book. She walked over to where Elfriede sat, inspecting the washing job he had done on their clothes. The princess sat down next to him on the bed, legs crossed and hands folded in her lap. "Elfriede, if I may, might you be able to answer a question for me?" Afina asked politely, with only the slightest edge to her voice.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

Elfriede snapped out of where his mind was lost, stops mindless washing the same shirt and to and turns to Afina.

"Yes of course, what do you need answered Miss Afina? Is everything alright?"

Slight concern lined his voice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

"Do you find yourself feeling disillusioned from the fight?" Afina asked abruptly. Seeing Elfriede's confused features, she elaborated. "It's simply just that. We should have emerged victorious in a fight that resulted in a dubious tie. At best. And..." she clears her throat. "I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps a proficiency in light magic isn't enough to become the person I want to be. Or, for the good of my kingdom, the person I _need_ to be."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

Faun stares at her and smiles. "Yes, I feel the push to better myself after the conflict, but you are one of the most talented light mages I've met. Even my time spent among the lumos branch of the clergy your magic is on par with all but the highest." He sighs. "That women was just not ...normal..."

He smiles again, "So what is it you are asking me princess? Do I think you should train more?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

"I... well yes of course! And I will! I'm ashamed of the way I fight with a dagger, with only the most rudimentary blocks. So, yes I wish I train with weaponry more. But I think in another sense, perhaps one magic isn't enough. Perhaps I should be dedicating myself to more of them. But light magic is all I've ever known, and all my teachers ever taught me! So... I guess... in a way I'm afraid to learn a new discipline." She wrings her hands together. "But I don't think I'm adequately able to fight with light magic and poor knife skills alone."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

Elfriede looks breifly surprised. 
"I'm surprised someone as well studied as yourself only dedicated yourself to one type of magic. Although I suppose light magic is a different kind of disapline."

Elfriede looks down and thinks for a moment.

"With someone of your own fiery passion there only seems to be one choice. Some others in the clergy would take another practice who's greatness was expanded upon based on emotion. Or at least that's the idea."

Elfriede stood up and looked at her eye level. (As they are around the same height)

"Have you ever given pyromancy a thought Lady Afina?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

"Fire? Awfully destructive for a Tyndall, no? And. Well, yes that probably is quite shocking. But I was always skilled in light magic, so I never ceased learning more about it, in order to reach the highest proficiency possible. I never considered anything else, but I don't want the situation of last night to be repeated. Do you believe fire to be the most fitting for me, truly?" She asks, head cocked slightly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

"Either that or its close cousin... lighting. 'Tis a similar practice. Unfortunetly all of the Anima magics are going to be destructive Miss Tyndall. And I cannot reccomend the dark arts."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

"Yes, perhaps a light and dark mage would be a sight to see. I don't think I would like to be such a mage," she says, though a flicker of curiosity flashes through her eyes. She sighs. "Thank you for your honest input, Elfriede. I truly appreciate it. Were you not already a devout defender of Eraia, I would have promoted you to the King's Guard. Or, well. Whatever the Eraian equivalent might be," she laughs lightly. "I almost forget my social graces. Are you feeling alright in the wake of the skirmish?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

Elfriede chuckles a bit at that. 

"Yes I am quite alright, I'm still feeling very tender in the abdomen but I feel like I'll recover mostly by the morn. And yourself? I remember you taking a decent hit before I went full unconscious, I should be the one asking **you**. You are my livelihood at the moment after all." 

Elfriede laughs a bit again.

"I will say I'm glad to see you out of those drab clothes. They didn't quite... *Fit* you if I may be so forward."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Afina's cheeks flush light pink, and the princess is unable to hide her shocked expression. "Oh! Yes, right. I'm quite fine, a little leg and abdominal injury is nothing out of sorts for a medical mage. Narder can clearly be trusted to maintain his garrison's, as well as our, health. And ah, yes, I was not a personal advocate for the gown either. I'm glad to see you're..." Afina hesitates, realizing that Elfriede still lacked a shirt, and still wore the plain trousers that the garrison had provided. "you're on your way to your armor once more. It is most fitting for a knight of your stature."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

Elfriede studders a bit. "A-ah yes I just need to get this shirt sewed and I'll be donning my armour again for training later. It doesn't feel right training without it. "

Feeling overly flattered and wanting to change the subject Elfriede studders out. 

"Do you think you can help me with that?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

"Training? I should be asking _you_ the same question. You seem very comfortable and familiar in combat. I would be honored to train with you. Hopefully the base has practice weaponry for the likes of us," Afina reaches down to feel the fabric of the drying clothes. Mostly dry. Gathering the fabric in her arms, Afina does a small curtsy. "Now if you'll excuse me, I should repair our clothes so we don't have to spar in our current attire. I don't think that is a situation either of us prefer," she smiles.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

"Quite, I prefer to spare with my clothes *on* as it turns out. Thank you very much, I will try to show you all I can later today if you'll have me."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

"Of course. Especially when you still have to redeem your shortcomings from our first skirmish in the cabin _Knight Lieutenant_."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-27*

*Elfriede smirks deviously* "That almost sounds like a challenge *Princess.* I won't hold back."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

[END ASIDE]

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-30*

```Location: Eraian Theanovene Border Station
Asided from: Mess Hall
Characters: Elfriede Faun, Atalantia Enneka, Afina Tyndall, Ransford, Narder```

Elfriede sits somewhat near the captain and motions for his companions to sit beside him. He eyes the feast on the table. It gives him flashbacks to the parties his parents use to throw to impress the other noble families. It was always a sort of competition among themselves… it was petty. Once he got older Elfriede began getting invited to these parties, especially as his ranking rose in the military. He went to a couple of such events with Yuria, but never drank anything. Eraians generally drink during events, so it was unusual and he got some flack for it sometimes. It was likely that today would be no different.

Elfriede shook the thought from his mind and glanced over to Ransford who was looking his way at this moment. “Thank you for your hospitality despite all that has happened.” He pretends to sip his wine, a learned trait to ward off anyone who thought he wasn’t letting loose enough. Why would you ***want*** to be loose as a knight. It all seemed very counterintuitive to him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-30*

Afina frowns at the benches of the mess hall, accustomed to the ornate chairs of home. She joins Elfriede, awkwardly swinging one leg over the bench to be seated. She analyzes the contents of the table. Impressive, especially for a military complex, but hardly comparable to Itory's cooking. "Thank you Commander, your hospitality is much appreciated," she nodded, smoothing out the wrinkles in her dress once more. The princess had immediately fell into step with her training of her younger years. Spread a napkin across your lap, elbows off the table, back straight...

A young solder came by, offering wine, and Afina graciously accepted, before turning to watch the soldiers admire Atalantia's fitness and swordsmanship. She had to resist smiling between sips.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-30*

Noting Atalantia getting fawned over a bit made Elfriede smirk a bit, as well as did Afina's awkwardness in this setting. 

He glances towards Ransford, "I hope you will have us for the night commander, but we definetly plan on leaving in the morn for the south trade route town near the border."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-30*

A thought suddenly strikes Afina as she watches the men laugh and admire Atalantia, and the princess lowers her glass. She surreptitiously glances at her own physique, frowning at her thin frame and soft features. There existed quite a discrepancy between herself and Atalantia. Afina’s heart sank, and she turned back to her food, eating quietly. She halfheartedly chimed in after Elfriede. “Yes, we will naturally be gone in the morning, after an evening of recuperation and celebration, if you, as commander of this outpost, would be so kind.”

**Bill** - *2018-01-30*

"Why would I turn you away after all this?" Ransford says, rasing a brow at Elfriede. "Stay the night, head out in the morning."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-30*

Elfriede nodded half heartenly and scanned the room full off people laughing and smiling. This was worth it, there was loss to be sure, but people would be safer now. His eyes stopped on Afina who was frowning lightly and had stopped eating. She appeared to be thinking about something sad, but he wassnt sure if he should ask or pry.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-30*

Afina pushed her food around her plate, frowning at the roasted chicken and steamed vegetables. This was an odd feeling to grapple with; naturally the soldiers wold gravitate towards a physically superior woman. Why should she be surprised? "Thank you sir,  the kingdom of Laera and I appreciate it."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia hesitates in her swordsmanship training as she notices in her peripheral vision that a bunch of the soldiers fawn over her abilities. 
*"Are women not common in the military?"* Atalantia thought as she observed the soldiers silly admiration towards her. 
Because of the constant attention, Atalantia began to become flustered from the countless eyes on her, and felt that she could not practice effectively. In order to combat her embarrassment Atalantia decided that it would be best to push through the swarm of soldiers so that she may join her friends in the mess hall. 

"AH, I found you guys!" Atalantia said in a flustered tone as she finally was able to escape some attention and join her friends. She had not been able to have a decent conversation with them since leaving the tower on their initial quest. 
"I want to thank both of you for coming back to the bandit hideout in order to help me" Atalantia says as she looks at both Elfriede and Afina. 

She then focuses on Elfriede first, "I especially want to thank you for assisting in my fight against Rica. If you hadn't joined, I surely would have lost as a result of my stubbornness."

She then leans towards Afina and says, "I also want to thank you as well princess. Your magic abilities we're incredibly valuable, and definitely helped me to defeat Rica as well"

Atalantia sits back in her chair after taking a moment to thank her friends. "*Sigh* Hello everyone! Now what were we talking about?" Atalantia states towards the entire company of the table. Her stomach then grumbles upon admiring the food on the table.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

The slightest twinge in the corner of Afina's eye is the only thing that betrays her thoughts. Did Atalantia _really_ just stride over here as if half the outpost wasn't fawning over her? Afina bites her tongue, forcing her voice to hold a steady, noble tone. "You're quite welcome. We were just discussing the possibility of training together later today." They had not, in fact, been discussing such a topic, but Afina felt now was as good a time as any to broach the topic.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Ooooo training?! Yes! I think that would be an excellent idea! I'm sure we all would be able to bring a lot of valuable lessons to the table. Although what type of training are you hoping to achieve" Atalantia responds rather quickly as her eyes shone brightly in anticipation to begin.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede nodded and smiled at the two about the training. "I personally was thinking our teamwork, plus Afina had mentioned improving her swordplay?" 

Elfriede looks to Afina to confirm his statement.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Hm? Oh yes, I appreciate both of your skill in combat as swordsmen. I think I would like to be able to... provide an adequate defense of myself as well. It seems light magic isn't performing to quite the caliber that I hoped it would. I would be honored to train with such decorated fighters," she says, turning her gaze back to her plate.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Hmm well I certainly have a lot of experience with hand-to-hand combat, especially with my dual blades, so I'm sure I'd be able to help." Atalantia says while clunching her fist and thrusting it in the air as if some sort of victory pose. She was determined to help her friends any way she could, so that she could continue earning their trust and prove her worth.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Gaze still fixed down, Afina contines. "I would offer help in the magical arts, but I do not believe skill in light magic is as transferable as skill with a sword. And my dagger abilities leave much to be desired." Afina pats her mouth with her napkin and rises from the table. "Do meet in the courtyard this afternoon, yes?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Sounds like a plan! Let's do this" Atalantia nods in response to Afina.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

"Absolutely, I'm actually kind of excited! I haven't done much group training since military school back in Lyall."

Elfriede's eyes flicker a bit with excitement.

[End asideooo]

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

```
Location: Eraian Border Station- Training Courtyard
Characters: Elfriede Faun, Atalantia Enneka, Afina Tyndall
```

The training courtyard was well-stocked with mock weaponry and training dummies; Ransford was clearly adept at keeping his men’s skills sharp. As Atalantia approached the center of the training grounds, Afina walked out to meet her. The princess had replaced her dagger and sheath with a wooden dagger tucked into the waistband of her belt.  She held an old, messy book in her hands, with pages jammed into the folds at odd angles, jutting out of the book in every direction. 

“I find the best assessment of each others’ skills will lie in combat with each other,” Afina announced. “It is only after this that we can fight using proper teamwork. Atalantia, would you be willing to spar with me first?”

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia steps forward with great conviction and pride. "I would love to spar with you first, princess. Only question is do you want me to hold back or not?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina shakes her head. “Do not hold back,” she says. “Holding back will mean that we only learn falsehoods of each others skills.” The princess opens her book, holding it at the ready. A couple meters separates her from her laguz companion.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Haha alright, then I won't princess. Get ready to face the wrath of a true ultimate alpha" Atalantia exclaims in a hearty and pumped up tone. She then grabs hold of both of her blades and runs towards Afina at full force. 
She then lifts both of her blades and acts as if she's about to strike Afina's legs, but then twirls to the side so that she can get in back of Afina, as she hopefully attempts to block the leg strike. Atalantia then attacks Afina from behind, aiming for the shoulder blades.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina's eyes go wide, and a bubble shield of light pops up over Afina's head, flowing from a hand extended skyward. "Atalantia!" the princess shouts from within her bubble. "Did you not exchange your weapons for prop weaponry!? This is training, not an assisted murder-suicide!"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia hesitates right before striking Afina and her eyes widen. "What is this prop weaponry you speak of? Do you all not train as if its the real deal.... I... I... don't understand????" Atalantia states fairly innocently, clearly not comprehending how people outside of her tribe prepare for combat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

The light shield fades around Afina as she lowers her hand and ceases reading. Withdrawing the wooden dagger from behind her back, she holds it out to Atalantia. "This is what the nobility, and many of the soliders, use to become more skilled with their weaponry. It is a staple of modern training, as it provides the benefits without any of the damaging drawbacks."

"I advise you try using them, for our sake as well as yours."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Ah I suppose that make sense. Although how do you all prepare for battle wounds then? Wooden props surely don't prepare yourselves to face the real deal of pain?
I am sorry if I seem frustrating; I just truly don't quite understand you nobles yet." Atalantia says awkwardly laughing as her face begins to blush

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"To be injured would be to rely on a medicinal mage to assist you," Afina instructs, sheathing her wooden dagger. "It would be rude to impose upon a mage, when one could simply avoid getting injured in the first place."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Oh... I suppose that's understandable." Atalantia acknowledges Afina, trying to grasp on to the new style of training.
"I will train with your wooden swords then! Shall we try again?" Atalantia questions.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede finishes a short discussion with some of the soldier in the mess hall and walks out to see Atalantia swing her swords at Afina and his jaw briefly drops.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Once more," Afina says, grabbing hold to two wooden swords and handing them to Atalantia.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Thank you!" Atalantia states in a determined manner. She was going to train the princess well, and learn the ways of the nobles.

Atalantia accepts the two blades and starts to walk back to the starting position. "Elfriede, can you start us off?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede sighs heavily, he might have to change his mind, this might be a long trip....

"If you two insist of sparring ..... Fine... Just do not get more injured alright? We have a trip to make tomorrow."

He eyes the two of them.

"Alright.. take your positions."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina's back straightens, and she raises her hand in front of her to cast. She exhales, preparing to read as soon as Elfriede gives the signal.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia holds the wooden swords out in front of her, she was not about to give up. She also looks to Elfriede to give the signal

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

He pauses awkwardly and sigh disapprovingly.

"Alright, ... seriously dont get injured, 3.....2......1...... commence the duel."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

The second Elfriede gives the signal, Afina directs a flash of light in front of Atalantia’s face. A quick flash, it abruptly fades, and Afina immediately switches battle tactics. A halo of light appears in the grass around Atalantia’s feet, shooting upwards in a bright, coalesced beam.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia smirks, and dodges the blast of light right away. She was familiar with Afina's tactic from her fight with Rica.
She then runs towards Afina, grabs on to her shoulder and flips over her. She then attempts to strike at full force, but loses balances as a result of the shoulder pain she still felt from her injuries with Rica

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina seeks an advantage as Atalantia stumbles, spinning around to re-direct her light beam, and aiming for Atalantia’s torso. _If she could hit the solar plexus, she would knock the wind out of Atalantia and weaken her_, Afina thought.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia notices Afina trying to plant another spell onto her. Atalantia reacts by kicking Afina's book out of her hands, and goes for a strike at her torso

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina's book goes flying out of her hands, and she doesnt even blink, instead unsheathing her dagger to parry Atalantia's blow. Noticing Atalantia's other sword, Afina throws her elbow back for a quick jab in Atalantia's ribs. She then ducks and sprints, hoping to recover her book.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia's eyes widen as Afina successfully hits her. She was fairly surprised at the princess' abilities. Atalantia then attempts to swing at Afina again, but Afina ducks immediately and runs for her book

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina dives for the book and snatches it up, but neglects to find a proper way to stop herself in her tragectory. The princess crashes into a stack of boxes filled with training equipment. Dizzy, Afina tries to shake it off, and stands up

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia notices Afina crash into the boxes becoming dizzy, and takes the opportunity to push her back onto the ground. Atalantia aims to pin her down to the ground.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede winces a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina tumbles back onto the boxes, and they collapse beneath her with a crunch. She holds steadfast onto her book, however, and flips it open at the last second. A bright ball of light explodes between the two women.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia springs back as a result of the light. She was not used to fighting someone with magic, so this was a very interesting experience. Atalantia regains her stance and braces towards Afina for hopefully what would be the last blow

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina takes the advantage, and tackles Atalantia while she's stunned, unsheathing her wooden dagger to hopefully end the spar immediately. Afina successfully tackles the larger woman, but ends up fumbling on the grass, trying to battle for the advantage.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia is pleased to see Afina fumble; this was her chance.
She kicks Afina forward once again so that she can pin her to the ground, and takes a jab at her side successfully hitting. Atalantia tried to restrain herself from hurting Afina too badly, but was still determined to win

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede leans in worried, he was going to have to call it soon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina feels the sharp jab of the wooden weapon in her side, and decides this is her chance. She mocks doubling over in pain, slipping a bundle of folded paper from the pockets of her tunic. In an instant, Afina begins to read, and the courtyard erupts with light. When the brightness clears, a ring of fire encircles the two women. Afina's face breaks into a triumphant smile. Perhaps light magic _wasn't_ the only option for her.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia was taken off guard by Afina's new tactic. She had no clue where the battle was going to lead now

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina shook herelf from her victorious reverie, noticing that Atlantia too had been shocked by her newfound skill. _A double win_ Afina thought, unsheathing her daggar and jabbing low.

Afina's mock knife made contact with Atalantia's skin with a grunt, and the princess continued to play the advantage.  She struck upwards, with the intent to daze Atalantia and knock her onto her back

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia laid on the ground in shame. Was it because she was lost in combat without her dual blades? She had never fought without them

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina held her dagger in a defensive position, her shoulders only relaxing once she heard Elfriede call the end of the match behind her. Afina wedged the wooden knife back into her belt, hesitating for a second to extend a hand to Atalantia. The fire around them had been extinguished, replaced with charred, blackened grass.

"Thank you for sparring with me, it was a pleasure," Afina nodded

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

Atalantia took Afina's hand. The princess had won, and she had to accept that. It may have been through the aid of magic, but regardless it was a good fight. 
"Thanks for introducing me to magic. Next time I suggest we fight with the real deal though" Atalantia nodded back

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede watched the two and sighed one last time, he couldn't help but feel Afina was trying to show off a bit after Atalantia received so much praise.

She is so mature and yet not is so many ways. Not that he could really talk..

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Perhaps," Afina says, helping to pull the laguz warrior up. "Well? Next match?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Faun squinted at Fina... "What do you mean... *Next match* ...princess?."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

"Naturally sparring each other is the key to maximizing our teamwork. How do we know what the other is capable of, without testing for ourselves?" Afina replied, cocking her head.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-31*

"Afina speaks the truth" Atalantia agrees

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede looked at her disapprovingly once more and sighed. 

"..And who would my opponent be? You miss Afina? Surely you wouldn't challenge the knight that is supposed to be protecting you to a duel?"

His voice dipped slowly in that sentence from concerned to overconfident and suddenly he was smirking.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina's brows furrow. "Yes, most certainly, you should be sparring both Atalantia, and myself. Is there something wrong with that?" She folds her arms.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

His responsible side was screaming at him not to but his competitive side fought him every step of the way. 
"I don't know... I don't think we should... But, like I said earlier, I will not go easy on you Afina." The agile boy stepped forward grabbing a small dagger and a sword from the sparring weapons racks.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

_Afina_, she thought, _there he goes, dropping the noble title again_. With a "hmph" she strode towards the center of the room, adjusting the wooden dagger held in her belt and opening her book. She turned to face Elfriede. "Call the start when you please," she said firmly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

"When I please?"
He gets into his usual duelist stance with his sword foward and dagger behind his back.
"Ready when you are princess"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina takes a moment to assess Elfriede. She knew his strength was in speed with his weapons. He was cunning, as well, but lacked raw power.  He was much more eventally matched with Afina than Atalantia was. Afina resolved to disarm her opponent. "Commence!" she declares, taking a defensive position with the anticipation that Elfriede would attack first.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

A few awkward seconds went by as they both stood there and waited for the other to make a move. Elfriede.. wasn't used to his opponent ..not attacking first. Faun guessed he was going to have to get things rolling. 

He shuffled forwards suddenly, swung lightly at Afinas forward leg and back stepped slightly trying to provoke an attack.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina watched as Elfriede struck first, though she was unsure of what... exactly his attack was meant to do? She had to retaliate, but Elfriede would be too smart to fall into a column of light. Directing her spells in his direction, Afina set off a series of small, crackling lights in an attempt to confuse the knight. Perhaps if he could stumble backwards into her spell...

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

He side stepped expecting a spell but the spell the came was not at all what he expected. He quickly jumped left and right almost losing his balance.

"I suppose I should get more aggressive?" He conceded.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina dashed forward, hoping to knock Elfriede off his feet, with enough time to conjure a spell that would significantly weaken him. He recovered quicker than she expected however, and Afina had to unsheathe her dagger in anticipation of an oncoming counterattack,

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede regained his composure and narrowly side stepped Afina's advance. 
Faun raised his rapier up in anticipation.

"Alright my lady, let's get serious. "

Elfriede suddenly lunged towards her with a barrage of thrusts trying to open her guard.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

Afina held up her dagger to parry his advances, dropping her book in the process. _Darn_ she thought. _She had completely forgotten to take into account Elfriede's well-developed defensive skills. _ Afina managed to block most of his thrusts, but hesitated on the last hit, and her practice dagger was unable to hold the block. With a dull thunk, the mock sword hit her shoulder, and Afina scowled.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede felt the triumphant thud when the sword found an opening and hit her shoulder. He then felt a light pang of guilt. Should he be really sparring so openly with his charge. It seemed counter productive. He *could*  potentially get in trouble for it. Also he just felt bad striking the Lady. Although given the opportunity she wouldn't go easy on him right?

That thought gave him another burst of motivation to continue pressing the attack.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

The impact of the hit had shocked Afina into launching a more aggressive resistance against Elfriede's attacks. She had assumed he would go easy on her by default, perhaps she had been wrong. It seemed that Elfriede's vigor had also been renewed; the two were locked in what seemed to be a stalemate of blows and parrys.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-31*

Elfriede suddenly stopped attacking, spun and swung low at her legs hoping for a trip to end the fight.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

Afina side-stepped the lunge, instead bringing her arms up high above her head. Elfriede was her height, but he had had to duck to try and get a good hit in on her legs. She brought her arms down hard on his upper back, using the wooden dagger hilt as leverage.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-01*

Her hands came down hard on his upper back sending a bit if pain through his shoulders. *There it is!* he was glad she finally hit him, he didn't feel so guilty now.

Faun took it all in stride and used the force of her hit to lower himself more. 
He suddenly tuck,rolled and spun with his leg out sweeping her legs from behind.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

With a yelp, Afina fell backwards, right onto her open book on the floor. The air rushed out of Afina's lungs with the force of the fall, and she gasped. She held fast to her dagger, but wasn't even sure how to use it now that she was on the ground. Elfriede had made her drop her book early into the fight. That was why she was losing so soon. Afina fumbled for the papers in her pocket, hoping to conjure another elementary fire spell before Elfriede got cocky enough to attack again.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-01*

Elfriede heard her gasp and breifly paused his assault to check if she hit too hard then saw her fumbling in her pockets. He obviously just saw this and didn't want to be set ablaze. He dropped his weapons and grasped at her wrist trying to bring it behind her back and under control so she could not.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

Afina watched as Elfriede dropped her weapons and knew this was her only opportunity. The two of them grappled for the tomes, with Elfriede trying to remove them from her sight. She hoped she could stabilize them enough to read. She had no intention of setting fire to any_one_ but perhaps just enough to get a distraction...? Afina inhaled sharply as Elfriede seemed to be getting the upper hand; maybe she just didn't have the strength to gain an advantage. She cursed herself for dropping her spell book so quickly in the match.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-01*

Although not the strongest, Elfriedes dexterity came through. He found the right angle and brought her arm around behind her back. All the while wrapping his arm around her neck and under her other arm so she lost her freedom of arm movement.

"It was a good fight, do you yield Lady Afina?" He said respectfully.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

Afina struggled against Elfriede's hold, but to no avail. It must have been a tactic that he learned in the military. She relaxed with a sigh. "Yes, I yield. Clearly you are not the knight that fought in the cabin yesterday," she said with a twinge of sarcasm, and the princess straightened herself up as Elfriede released his hold. "Clearly you are quite adept in protecting, as well as defeating, princesses."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-01*

Elfriede stands up and lets go of Afina. 

"Yes,yes very funny. Perhaps I could show you some sword tricks next time, instead of sparring against you."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

Afina nods. "Yes, of course. There will be free time while we're travelling, naturally. I look forward to such an occasion. I'm impressed with your work today, Knight Lieutenant Elfriede," she says, folding her hands.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-01*

Surprised by her sudden shift in demeanor from slightly annoyed to appreciative and complementory caught Elfriede off-gaurd. He shys away a bit and stammers. "A-ah yes, thank you you for the compliment my lady, I will do my best."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Location: Eraian Trade Route, night time
Characters: Elfriede Faun, Afina Tyndall
```

Afina took a deep breath, concentrating on a nearby patch of dirt and sticks. Though she had only a few pieces of paper's worth of tomes, the princess was determined to garner an elementary grasp of fire magic. Sparks flickered and crackled across the ground, and Afina pressed her concentration. In an instant, a small blaze erupted from the ground, and Afina smiled triumphantly. The light of the fire danced across her face, throwing shadows in all her features. 

The fire continued to burn, fueled by the tinder beneath it, as Afina switched books. She ran her hand along the pages of her light magic tomes, frowning at the couple of spells she had not quite grasped yet. Concentrating once more, she directed a ball of light towards a stump in front of her. _Come on_, she thought. _Just detonate!_ The light continued to grow in front of her, burning more brilliantly with every passing second. 

The sound of a stick snapping behind her shocked Afina from her focus. She directed a ball of light to the source of the noise. "Hello?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

Elfriede had heard the crackling and whispering whilst trying to sleep. He sat up and looked around at his 2 companions bedrolls that they had set up that night for camping... *one was empty*. He figured one of them had left to relieve themselves most likely, not all that odd for traveling the distance they had. He started to worry a bit as time passed. "...maybe I should check on them.." He whispered to himself. 

Faun stood up and followed the sounds into the pitch black night a short distance away to where he saw the feintest sparks among the trees. The moon wasn't out tonight so the feintest light was clearly visible.
He took a breath in and slowly approached a small clearing in the woods. He rounded a tree and there sat the princess lightly cursing herself under her breath. He sat and watched for a minute thinking to himself about her; how light magic works and her devotion to herself. It had always been something he was curious about, something that he always didnt grasp. That longing had his feet walking forward against his better judgment.

. . . . . ***snap***

Elfriede jumped back bit as Afina thrusted a ball of light in his face.

Wincing at the bright light he stammered out softly "H-hello Lady Afina. I just had heard you and...came to check on you. But then.. I got curious. I didnt mean to startle you."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

The bright light immediately faded, leaving the two only able to see each other by the light of the small fire. "Oh," Afina realized softly. "Well thank you, I appreciate the concern. I'm quite alright, though. Just doing some training before we're back to traveling tomorrow. Did I wake you?" She cocked her head. 

It was clear that studying had put her in a much better mood than when they had been fighting laguz days before. The princess had a penchant for stubbornness, but her demeanor seemed surprisingly attentive and receptive amidst her studies. 

Afina paused, analyzing Elfriede's features. Her spell had forced him into a defensive posture, but he seemed much less knightly out of his armor. It was funny, in a way. That his training still held, even when he was dressed much more casually. Afina smirked at the thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

"I.. No, you did not wake me up. I was up lost in thought about everything under the sun. er.... Moon.." *there's no moon out tonight either you fool*

Elfriede relaxed his tense muscles and posture.

"I was watching you and... well, magic is something that I have thought about often, but never had much luck with. Although with how I've been busy since my schooling I havent had a chance to try it again since childhood. ...and well you learning new magic had me thinking...I was intrigued and curious and..." Elfriede searching for an excuse had him rambling for a bit. The was a childlike curiousity about him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

"Would you like to try to learn again?" she interjected, motioning towards her book. "I'm a student in fire magic myself, but perhaps you'd have luck with light magic. You _are_ from Eraia, after all, the same nation as many of the world's most prominent light mages. Come over here," Afina instructs, motioning towards him.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

"I'd... I'd think I'd like that. I really appreciate your generous offer. Let's try light magic."

Faun awkwardly shuffled foward and knealt beside her not really sure how to proceed.
I mean, he knew the basics: hold the book read some words, pick a location and *boom*, or something...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Afina hooks her arm in Elfriede's, standing up straight and pulling him with her. "First and foremost, you'll want to stand. It's easier to focus that way." She then plants her feet, and nods at Elfriede. "And then put your feet in a solid orientation. There’s often a… force that comes with casting.” 

The princess then takes his arm, and gingerly places her book in his hand. She looks at him and nods confidently. “The book is naturally quintessential. It expedites your ability to cast. It is imperative that you read from it.” 

Afina steps back, examining Elfriede’s form. He followed her instructions, but he still looked unsure in his stance. She pursed her lips. “The last component is faith. My instructor, Master Witella, used his faith in the church to guide him. I use my faith in myself.” She cracked a smile. “Though in Eraian territory, I use my faith in the church, of course.” 

The princess pointed at a tree stump. “Why don’t you use your faith in Lylalel and direct your spell at that stump?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

Elfriede tried listening to her every instruction, positioning his body in the way she said. The thought of Lylalel flooded his mind. Thoughts of the god of Erai- the world.
He focused his intent on the stump and felt arcane energy flow through him for the first time since childhood. The page began to burn up and a dim light flew from his hand a few feet and fizzled out. The page didnt even burn up fully. 

Elfriede slumped and tried to hide his embarassed and frustrated face. He knew why he wasn't able to do it, but wouldnt admit it to himself.

"...sorry I wasted your page..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Afina covered her mouth to hide the laughter that threatened to sneak through. Elfriede had made a valiant effort, and failure was a part of learning light magic. But that didn’t make the failures any less entertaining. “It’s alright, I have plenty of books to use for my own magical pursuits. And even more books coming for when we arrive at your residence.” She straightened up, clearing her throat. Perhaps Lylalel wasn’t the right inspiration. Perhaps Elfriede was more like herself.

“Try again, focus on yourself this time. You aren’t trying to attack; you’re trying to purify. Channel it. You know you have the potential, you’re a knight of Eraia. You can do it,” she encouraged.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

Elfriede straightened up.

"Alright I'll give it one more go."

He cautiously raised his hand again toward the stump and thought of his military prowess, all he'd done to please his parents for acceptance. He felt uneasy, but his competetive learning nature pushed him ever onward. He wanted this.

The page began to burn again as he felt arcane energy run through him. The stump lit up slightly more then last time and the page fizzled up entirely. He casted it but was extremely unimpressed with his results.
He glanced to Afina with a defeated look in his eyes.

"Maybe I'm just not cut out for this... I thank you for your patience my lady." Elfriede held the tomb out to her. "Perhaps I'll try... not... light magic next time."
He glanced awkwardly down as he knew that most casters in Eraia never even touched another magic. It wasn't *wrong* just... taboo? If he ever did he couldnt let his family know he did. Practitioners of light magic in Eraia would be questioned if they didn't use light magic on a day to day basis. Maybe they were trying to cover thier *unbelief* up. There was one case where a high up cleric was stripped of her rank for losing faith.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Afina smiled as Elfriede successfully cast his first spell. It wasn’t particularly strong, but it was a feat nonetheless. In a way, Afina was proud. She knew Elfriede would be able to do it; He had simply confirmed her inkling. The princess’ smile dropped as Elfriede turned back towards her, shoulders slumped and gaze downcast. He wasn’t faithful enough in his church or himself to cast very vibrantly. Afina felt a twinge of pity, but abruptly dismissed the feeling. Elfriede was a strong, dutiful fighter in other settings. There was no need to pity him, only comfort. 

The knight began to apologize, and she stepped towards him, a comforting hand going to his arm as the other took the book from him. “That was a valiant effort, Elfriede. I’m proud to see that you could accomplish as much as you could so quickly. Don’t be despondent, with time, you could achieve many high-level spells,” Afina said confidently, only faltering as she saw his face still sullen and despondent.

“And if light magic isn’t for you… then it’s no matter.” She lowers her voice, even though the darkness and quiet makes it seem like they’re the only two in the forest. The light from the fire flickers across her face, her gaze serious. “Light mages may be the most glorious in Eraia, even if the elemental magics aren't secondary. But if that’s who you are, you can’t deny it. After all, if not faith, what keeps you rooted in Eraia’s ways?” 

Afina doesn’t even wait for a response, instead her head tilting to examine the sword that was strapped to his side. Perhaps if she could help him with light magic, he would be able to also provide an exchange of information…

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

Elfriede felt her hand on his arm and heard her words to him, about himself and his country, but didnt... He was lost in thought for a moment about hes loyalty to Eraia and parents, and his sister. He always separated his parents and his sister in his mind, but were they really that different? They both seemed to have unwaivering faith to thier country always keeping up the solid appearance of the perfect Eraian noble family. And of course he was expected to do the same. A failure in magic would not be tolerated, thus he *shouldn't* if he *can't*. But Elfriede couldn't dispell that curiousity within him. He wanted to be able to do that which he could not.

Afina gazing at his sword lost in her own thought broke his concentration. He watched her with an inquisitive face. "What is on your mind?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Afina’s eyebrows raise and her gaze abruptly shoots away. “Well. I’ve been thinking about that fight recently. Against the laguz. And regardless of the sparring we did the other day. I wonder if I don’t have adequate ability to attack with light magic alone. Or even fire magic now.” Afina hesitates for a moment. 

“And my skills with a dagger are rudimentary at best. So as soon as I lose my book-- I mean, that’s how you beat me in sparring after all-- but as soon as I lose my book, I feel like… I can’t defend myself.” Afina looks up abruptly. “And I trust you to protect me! Of course. But should an unfavorable situation occur, or you become indisposed…” She glances back at his rapier. “I want to prevent the outcome of the laguz fight from being repeated.” Afina glanced away, hoping Elfriede could read into the situation enough to realize what she was asking.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

Elfriede worked through her words and understood. She didn't want him running off like he had been doing in all thier recent fights.

"Oh, I apologize... I only ran off in those fights because I thought you well defended, but I will not anymore. Please forgive me."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Afina frowns. “It’s not that. I just don’t want to be dependent on your ability to protect me all the time. Just because I am a princess does not mean I am content being a damsel in distress.” She huffs, realizing she has to be forthright. “Can you show me how to use a sword?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

Elfriede smiles wide. All the frustration washed away in that moment. 

"Absolutely! We can get started whenever you would like, there are many aspects and slights of defensive parries that many peopl---"

*Faun composes himself and gathers his thoughts*

"Perhaps we could have a session every so often where I teach you what I know and in return... on off days.. perhaps you can help me understand what it is about light sorcery that I have yet to understand."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Afina blinked as her mind processed what Elfriede had said, before her own face broke into a smile. “Really?” Her eyes flashed with excitement, and just as Elfriede had composed himself, Afina’s own hands went to cover her mouth. “Would you truly do that for me? I would be eternally grateful if you could help me in such a way. And I would surely reciprocate!”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

"Of course, it'll give us something to do on this long journey, and I'm excited to watch your progress as well as my own. Thank you Afina, I will try to not let you down." 

Elfriede glances around suddenly becoming aware of the pitch black and how long they've been out here.

"Perhaps we should turn in for the night, we've been out here a while and you even longer still." ~~He holds out a hand to her.~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

“Ah, yes. And if Atalantia has stirred, she may be creating a path of wreckage through the forest in pursuit of us. That is perhaps something to be avoided,” Afina grinned sheepishly. As if on cue, the small fire Afina had created from her spell fizzled out, leaving nothing but glowing embers in its wake. The overcast night made it difficult to see, with Afina just barely able to glimpse Elfriede’s features in the dark. “I believe your culture would say that that is a sign from Lylalel to go to bed as well, yes?”

Afina followed close behind Elfriede as they made their way back to camp, taking off her boots to set them beside her bedroll. “Thank you, Elfriede. Sleep well,” she whispered, before settling back under her covers. She closed her eyes, her body relaxing. She was continuing her journey towards enlightenment at an exceptional pace, a feat that many Laerans would have deemed impressive.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-04*

When they returned he noticed Atalantia hadnt budged and was still sound asleep. He got comfy under his covers once again, hopefully for the last time tonight, and said back in a quiet voice , "Of course, good night lady Tyndall." He slipped into his thoughts again and slowly drifted to sleep.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina’s brows furrowed and eyes shot open as she realized that Elfriede had dropped the honorary title earlier, without her even noticing. She repeated the phrase in her head, _Thank you Afina_. There was nothing particularly subversive about what he said. Perhaps it was innocent enough to forget the “Lady” title. Especially if Afina was making an honest effort at becoming friends with her companions, which she felt like she was. The princess closed her eyes. Yes, perhaps just “Afina” would suffice.

[END ASIDE]

```
Location: Eraian Bath House
Characters: Atalantia, Afina
```

Afina nods a "thank you" at the innkeeper, before making her way down the hall. The changing room is quaint and simple, with lockers lining the side walls. Afina hesitantly approaches a locker, opening it slowly to peer inside. Deeming it vacant, she takes off her pin, and her cloak falls away. Afina folds it neatly, placing the pin on top of the stack of folded fabric. Removing her boots and then leggings, Afina suddenly becomes immensely aware of Atalantia's presence beside her. 

With only her undergarments and traveling tunic left, Afina looks over her shoulder at her companion. Atalantia had, for the most part, disrobed without any hesitation. Afina turns back to the wall, hands wrapped across her body. Laera wasn't shy about bare arms or legs, but the torso was another matter entirely. The princess begrudgingly began to unzip her tunic, facing the wall. "What does Wynne think of nudity, Atalantia? I'm curious, and sorry to say I'm unfamiliar with that particular culture."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Hmmm...well nudity is not anything to be ashamed of in my tribe, for it is a natural thing. Although we do admire modesty and insist on clothing ourselves when in our human forms. I assume our culture in regards to nudity is similar to yours." Atalantia says trying to answer Afina best she can.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina shrugs off her dress, but grabs hold of it before it can fall to the floor, exposing only her shoulders. "Interesting, I would have never thought of that. And what do you make of Eraia thus far?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Well considering we have just arrived, I must admit I'm still not entirely familiar with Eraia. However it seems like an interesting area for sure. It's nothing like the outskirts of Wynne.

I'm quite excited to learn more of the Eraian culture to be honest."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina takes a quick breath and hurriedly takes off her tunic as the wolf laguz talks, hoping that Atalantia hadn't turned around to address her. In the light of day, her pale scar tissue starkly contrasts the skin surrounding it, and Afina quickly wraps a towel around herself. She turns around, still wearing her undergarments. "Really? And is there any comparable religious influence in Wynne?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"I am not quite sure what religion you all celebrate, but perhaps the biggest difference is that my people greatly appreciate our god who has given us the gift to transform into our beast form." Atalantia tries to clarify

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

"Ah yes, that makes sense," Afina says, wiggling out of the rest of her clothes with one hand as the other holds the towel. "Laera is... different." Afina glances about the room, not quite sure she trusts the soundproofing of the area. She decides not to elaborate, for security reasons, instead making her way towards the bath. "Do we just... enter?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

Atalantia notices the fact that Afina failed to go into detail about the religion of Laera, but was curious how much it differed from her own. One of her goals in journeying was to gain a better understanding of the world outside of Wynne, so she decided to initiate further discussion on Laera.
"So what is the religion of Laera like? And yes, I believe we just enter."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina takes special care in speaking, knowing that they are not alone. "Laera is different because it does not have a national religion. It doesn't deny any particular divine power, but rather, sees almost all religions as equally plausible," she explains. "Kind of ridiculous, hm?" Afina says, forcing a laugh, glancing about the room. She exhales, stepping to the shallow bath with her towel still wrapped around her. She really did not want to do this.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Hmm I don't think it's ridiculous... while we do worship one higher being, my tribe has been open towards other beliefs. Perhaps the biggest issue we have is when others don't appreciate their beast form gifts, or our religion as a whole."
Atalantia walks towards the bath rather confidently in comparison to Afina. She was very anxious about being dirty still, and desired to clean herself badly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

"So, if the... animal form is a gift, then why have some acquired it, and other not?" Afina asked, still clutching her towel tightly.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Well for one, there are slightly um...racial differences in people of this world, which we must acknowledge. My tribe believes, and correct me if I'm wrong, but each race or area in this world might embrace a different god... hence the different religions we might encounter.

For the laguz people, my tribe believes that our god has chosen to give us the gift of transformation as a way to truly embrace the earth. Our beast forms allow us to truly be one with nature, and one with our animalistic self. I personally believe all laguz people have the gift to transform; some people just seem to dislike that fact or have not discovered how to use that form yet." Atalantia says trying to shine more light on to the ways of her tribe.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

While Atalantia is explaining, Afina hurriedly throws her towel to the side and ducks in the water. _Quite subtle, Afina_, she thinks to herself, but it appears that Atalantia had not noticed. Afina sinks beneath the water, comfortable to once again be covered. "There's laguz that deny their beast form? I thought that such a feat was impossible."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"I mean I have not encountered any that have in my tribe, but theoretically I assume there can be people who deny their beast form. Especially if a laguz individual lives in an area in which others do not accept our kind as willingly." Atalantia discusses considering both her knowledge from speaking with Rica, and how her friends originally though of her laguz form.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

"Therefore, they... _suppress_ their beast form? Is that difficult?" Afina asks, taking a cloth from the side of the bath to wash the dirt from her body. "Scholarly texts always said that laguz often borrowed traits from their animal form to appropriate for their human one. Is this true?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"I mean it takes conscious effort to transform, so I wouldn't say it's really suppressing. It's more so not wishing to use their form due to fear of not being accepted." Atalantia starts talking as she thoroughly enjoys soaking in the bath.

"We do borrow traits from our animal form, but it's more so to enhance our abilities to do certain tasks. So for example, I use my wolf form for hunting, scouting, and travel because those things are harder to do as a human.
Hmm I guess a way for you to consider our transformation is how you view your magic. Magic makes certain tasks easier for you as well, correct?" Atalantia begins to rub her arms, wiping off any excess dirt or blood that was not cleaned thoroughly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina continues to wash herself in silence, mulling over that which Atalantia had said. There was no way that a beast form was comparable with light magic. Absolutely no way! Afina forces a smile. "I'm afraid I don't comprehend, but I appreciate your attempt in explaining with familiar terms."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Hmmm what do you not understand? Perhaps I could explain better?" Atalantia truly wished to help Afina understand more of what she spoke of.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina hesitates. "Well. My light magic isn't necessarily a part of me. Intrinsic, if you would. You can't separate yourself from... _being_ a laguz. You know?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"I guess that's fair, but can't only certain people use magic?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina thinks back on her training session with Elfriede. "Not necessarily. One must think a certain way to use magic. But anyone can learn to think that way with enough effort. Correct me, but one cannot learn to have a beast form."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Oh, I assumed only certain people were gifted with the ability to use magic.... then you are correct, it's not very similar to being a laguz. However, you still use magic as a way to make things easier, right? Therefore it's similar in principle to the reason why we transform."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

"I understand, they are both means to an end. That seems the only way that they are comparable, however," Afina states, grabbing her towel from the edge of the bath. In one swift motion, she wraps it around herself as she stands from the bath, cleaned off the grime from traveling,

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Well it's still the point I was trying to illustrate;  As a Laguz individual I tend to use my beast form in order to make things easier, plus why not use a gift if you have been given it? At least for good anyway....." Atalantia remained in the bath, she was enjoying herself way too much.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Afina nods. _If only that were always the case_, she thinks, stepping out of the bath. "I see your point," the princess says, her stride leaving watery footprints in its wake. "Do hurry with the bath, by the way. I know Elfriede is anxious to feel at home once more." Afina then ducks into the changing room, anxious to put an end to the conversation.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-06*

"Ughhhhh I guess I can hurry if it's necessary. I do wish I had new clothes though; I feel very much dirty and unprofessional without any proper clothes." Atalantia states toward Afina, clearly not enjoying the fact of having to leave the bath.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Alone in the changing room, Afina sighs. _Atalantia just didn't understand_, Afina told herself, solemnly dropping her towel and pulling on fresh clothes. The same pale scar stood out like a crack in the princess' otherwise flawless skin. It caught Afina's eye in a mirror, and she hesitated, before it was smothered by the luxurious fabric of her formal clothes. Shoving her travel clothes into her pack and pinning her brooch to the shoulder of her dress, the princess briskly exited the changing room to reconvene with Elfriede.

[END ASIDE]

```
Location: Effera Market, Eraia
Characters: Atalantia, Afina, Elfriede 
```

"Is... this the market?" Afina asks tentatively, peering at the roving vendors with their wares. "Smaller than I would have imagined." Afina looks back at the spiraling church, wondering how such grand architecture could be surrounded by such... squalor. "Interesting," she mumbles to herself.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

Elfriede turns from eyeing the marketplace with a smile. He was in a much more upbeat mood after his bath. There was just something about being clean that was relaxing and cleared the mind.

"The grand marketplace in Lyall and other big cities is much more... Normal then this. This is only like this because of the nature of this settlement. It is primarily a trade route and has remained as such. These traders are either on their way to one of Eraias grand cities, or back up to Theonovane."

Faun watched Afina's eyes wander to the church.

He leans in and looks up at it too. "What do you think of the building, most buildings in Lyall match it in style. This one was put up after the trade route was secured, thus it looks different from the surrounding buildings that pre dated it."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

"It's magnificent architecture," Afina nods, inspecting the black stone. "Though I would have thought that a place with such renowned light magic would be more... white?" Afina's eyes light up as a thought strikes her. "Do you mean to say there's a light mage in this church?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

"I don't believe so, or at least I haven't heard of any casters of note way out here. Probably just the church staff. I'd recommend we go in so I can show you around but as you said we shouldn't waste *too* much time getting to Lyall. ... Then again we are staying the night. Maybe after shopping if you are interested?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

"Perhaps," Afina says, less enthused than before. She had been excited to begin learning more as soon as possible. The princess turns to the small marketplace, examining the stalls. She tentatively walks over to a trader carrying books, and begins to look over his wares. She glanced over at her companions, who were doing much the same. Afina had never bought something for herself before; she hoped one of her companions would make a purchase first so that she might see how such a deed was done. Was she to bargain? Or just accept prices? Did vendors offer deals? Turning over a faded brown book in her hands, Afina mindlessly thumbed through the pages. Perhaps she would have to _ask_ if the vendor carried spell books.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

"Im sorry, we might need to shop around a bit Lady Tyndall." He said seeing her disgruntled look. "This town isn't exactly meant for it, but the traders are always willing to offload some goods before continuing onwards."

"If you want I can take care of most of the bartering, most of the traders may give me better prices because I'm military." He says with a slight bow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Afina's relief was plainly written across her face as she put down the book and stepped aside. "Much appreciated, Elfriede. I'm afraid Itory always did the shopping back in Theanovene. I'm only searching for more books and provisions, nothing more. I have proper clothes from Laera already." _Not to imply that Eraian clothes were inferior_, she thought, looking at the Eraian residents around her. _They just didn't have the appreciation for blue and gray that Laera did_. "Though I fear that is not such the case for Atalantia, she must be struggling to find proper attire here."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

"Understood." He says with a slight nod and smile. "I will secure what I can."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

"Oh," she adds, gently grabbing him by the arm. "And perhaps you should pick up some light magic books for yourself, yes?" She says encouragingly. She lowers her voice. "You may not realize it but you've been making progress."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

Elfriede chuckles softy. "I dont know, perhaps id be more cut out for something like anima magic..." He says kinda softly trying not to draw attention.

"What about yourself? Wouldnt you like to buy something..." Faun glances down to her dagger sheathe at her side. "More substantial?"

Elfriede smiles excited again. One could say he had a sort of soft spot for weapon types. "Have you ever though about using a more elegant weapon like a rapier or a short sword!? or maybe a cutlass! All would suit a princess such as yourself! I personally couldn't see you using a mace or axe, much too barbaric!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

"Me? Have I really been doing so well as to warrant purchasing a weapon for myself? It would be awfully embarrassing to walk into battle with a sword I could not use..." she says hesitantly, though the idea of acquiring another skill by becoming a proficient swordsman excited her.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

"But you could train with it tel you are ready! I would probably have to recommend something small but larger then a dagger." *He starts gently pulling her along towards the nearest cart that looks like they have weapons.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

"I... well yes you make a fair point!" she says, startled as Elfriede starts pulling her along towards the nearest weaponry cart. _Awfully enthusiastic about helping another learn_, Afina thought, eyeing Elfriede. _She respected that_. Afina was glad to see the knight in high spirits, however. He had been so tired and weary from traveling. Clearly a nice bath can do much for an Eraian . Elfriede halts in front of the stall, rapidly beginning to analyze the weapons' selection. Afina herself leans in close. She wanted something elegant, but dependable.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

To be entirely honest Elfriede thought that a rapier would fit her the best, but he also felt a sense of pride surounding his weapon choice. As it wasn't nearly common in the military. He hesitated but he would still suggest it out of respect. Elfriede withdrew with 3 weapons, a smaller decorated rapier with a jewel on its pommel, a slender razor sharp long sword with blue inlays, and a small but sturdier cutlass with purple thread on its handle hanging down.

"You dont have to pick any of these ma'm but I'd thought I'd make some suggestions."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Afina picked up the longsword from the bunch, tracing the blue inlays with her finger. "This one seems fitting of a Laeran," she says, holding it out with two hands. "Is... is this actually a two-handed sword?" Afina asked, the embarrassing realization showing in the flush of pink to her cheeks. She probably looked like a child, trying to find a sword.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

"It's... not traditionally" He says laughing a tiny bit. "However thats not to say you cant use it two hands, it's long and it make take a bit to get used to the blanace. But really what decides it is its weight and grip size. You could just get it as a training sword until you are ready to get your own crafted by a smith artisan."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Afina straightened her back, going through the limited motions that she had learned in training with Elfriede. The blade still felt awkward in her hands, but that was likely simply due to her inexperience. "This feels as natural as I assume a sword could feel," Afina said, raising and lowering the sword to test its weight. "Then again, _I'm_ not the expert."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

"You wont truly know I suppose til you practice with it a bit. Why dont we buy it and see how it works for you, if it doesnt then we'll pawn it off later. Sound good?" He watched her excitedly. Faun didnt spend a lot of time teaching people but he was actually really enjoying it. Reveling in a the small technical aspects and sharing them was more fun then he realized. Especially if she bought this weapon which was somewhat simliar in shape to his, he could teach her so much.

"I suppose I owe it to you and myself to buy a light spell book as well." He conceded.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Afina nods in agreement, handing the sword over to Elfriede to do the haggling. "I very much appreciate this exchange of skills we have. I never anticipated you to be the teaching type. Perhaps you're more Laeran than you think," she says with a smile.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-10*

He pauses for a moment. "... perhaps." He says sort of solemnly staring off for a second.

"Alright then!" He shakes himself out of thought and exchanges some words with the traveling caravan for the weapon and manages secure the piece for a decent price.
He sheathes the sword and hands the new belt sheathe over to Afina with a smirk. 

"Come let us buy the rest of what we need! For the road... and for Atanlantia." He say's nodding to the tribal warrior from the north. "Hopefully we can secure you something at least somewhat to your liking. Although I doubt it'll look at all like what you used to have, this mostly Eraian goods on its way to Theonovane after all."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Afina ties the belt around her waist, and though it clashes with her formal outfit, the princess seems immensely prideful. She agrees, looking back at Atalantia, who seemed baffled by the outfit choices available. Afina almost pitied her; Atalantia was immersed in a culture entirely unlike her own. At least Laera had a few culture overlaps with Eraia; respect, the arts, et cetera. The laguz fighter, however... she must be utterly puzzled. Guilt tugged at Afina once more, from the current situation as well as their tension in the bathhouse, and she briskly made her way to the laguz woman to offer assistance. Perhaps should could teach the warrior a thing or two.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-11*

Atalantia was a bit flustered by the various merchants surrounding her. Back in her tribal days most of her trading would be done one on one, or with a smaller market. 

Atalantia looked towards her friends, "Do you think this market sells anything similar to this?" Atalantia points to her torn clothing. Her torn outfit was nothing too complex; her clothing consisted of a fabric top, a long but flexible robe type pants, and a leather strap to hold on to her blades. The most complicated part about her outfit was the Nordic embroidery that symbolized her status in the tribe. (ooc: look at miniature photo)

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-11*

"I would think that it sells something at least similar to your liking, we can probably secure you something even closer in Lyall, but our selection here is limited." He brings Atalantia across several leatherworker and clothier carts to browse thier selections.

"See anything that would do as a temporary replacement Atalantia?" He says skiming over the wares.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-11*

Atalantia looked at the wide variety of clothing options. Most of the vendors seemed to carry more elegant designs than Atalantia was used to. 
"Hmmm perhaps this one would work for now" Atlantia picked up a fire red colored one piece tunic, which seemed relatively basic and would allow for free movement. 
Atalantia also looked towards the leather, which all seemed fine in quality. "Hey, Elfriede, do you have any recommendations on which pieces might hold my blades best?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-11*

"Hmm since you have two youll probably want a tighter one for good balance. Elfriede carefully searched through the belts and pulled out an adjustable one that seemed sturdy. Here try this!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-11*

Afina pursed her lips at the bright red tunic. Red wasn't exactly the most _subtle_ color to travel in, but perhaps that was her bias for muted colors talking. Afina steps in, feeling the red tunic fabric. "Seems comfortable, and the highest priority is your freedom of movement. Which, this garment seems to permit. I think this is a good choice." She nods.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-11*

Atalantia looks towards Elfriede and the leather belt he chose. "If you think it'll be good, I'm willing to give it a shot!"

Atalantia then looks towards Afina, "Yes, this tunic does seem relatively comfortable. I will admit that red is more flashy than normal for me, but I feel like red reflects a bit of my personality, which is important to me if I am unable to find clothes that match my tribal ones."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-11*

Elfriede nods approvingly and proceeds to negotiate prices. Once the whole matter is settled the Knight leuitenant bought himself a small light magic book for practice on thier travels and stuffed it into his pack.

"Alright, we have a little time so we can either walk around town if you two are curious or head back to the inn for some much needed rest. We head out tomorrow in the morn as the sky first starts to turn pink from the dawn."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-11*

" I am satisfied taking a rest for now. Thank you for both of your help." Atalantia states towards her friends. She was relatively satisfied, but still wished she had clothing more suitable to her tribal heritage.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Afina looked about Effera, analyzing the architecture, and seeing the people milling about. "I would very much like to continue exploring," she said. "I _am_ in Eraia on a cultural exchange; I wish to experience as much as possible."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-12*

Faun nodded and glanced to Atalantia, "I suppose I will be taking the lady around the city for the afternoon, you are welcomed to join if you like. It is also fine if you'd like to get some rest and head back to the inn."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Characters: Afina Tyndall, Elfriede Faun
Location: The Woods En Route to Ebonary; Night
```

Afina shifted in her sleeping roll, wide awake and disgruntled by her experiences in Effera. _I just don’t get it_, she thought, face contorted in a tight frown. _Why would anyone let their citizen die like that, without even trying to help him?_. Eraian customs had not made sense many times, but this was the first custom that truly bothered her. It was _unjust_. Afina rolls over in her pack to see her companions nestled into their rolls comfortably. Their campfire had since burned out, and in the crisp fall air, the warmth was desirable. 

The princess opened her tomes, and with a pop, the fire crackled to life once more. Across the way, Afina could see Elfriede was also awake and staring at the night sky. He looked surprised at the sudden campfire, before seeing his charge was also awake. 

“Elfriede? Are you awake?” Afina asked. _Of course, dumb Afina, he’s looking at you right now_, she mentally reprimanded herself moments after.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-22*

Faun was broken from his trance of enjoying the fall night sky by a spark and then fire. 

*The knight slightly smirks, his eyes narrow and he nods slowly once.*

He stares at her for a moment.
"Are you troubled?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Afina blinks a few times, propping herself up on her elbow to address the knight. “Yes. I don’t… understand Eraian culture. But perhaps this is a conversation best had on a walk,” Afina says, nodding at Atalantia’s sleeping form. 

Afina quietly wiggled out of her sleeping roll, shocked by the sudden chill of the night air. She pulled her cloak around her, and stood up to promenade through the woods. 

“What do _you_ think of Eraia’s culture, Elfriede?” Afina asks once they are alone. “I know this is where you were raised, but I cannot help but notice that you seem… less invested than some of the other individuals in the country.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-22*

Elfriede throws off his cover, stands and stretches his aching muscles, then joins to walk alongside Afina. 

"I mean.. it's really all I've known. I do what I must to get by. It's not as if anything actively bothers me. They only thing that has me on edge lately is the constant Drecan attacks."

He pauses to think for a moment about her meaning. "I understand that we are from very different parts of the world, but is Leara really so different other then subtleties? We aren't taught as much about other cultures other then the basics. I'm assuming it's not far off from Theonovane? I've only visited that and some Drecan border towns."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Afina thinks for a moment. “Yes, Laera is quite similar to Theanovene, we have the kingdom’s largest universities, so we must be adaptable and accepting of those from many walks of life. Much like the trading city. But we’re accommodating. And Eraia feels so…” Afina searches for a word, careful to avoid upsetting Elfriede. “Inescapable.”  

“Rights and justice and providing for the citizen is an integral component of ruling for the nobility in Laera. But that priest in Effera. He made no motion to save that soldier, even if it was his duty to do so.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-22*

"That was because that soldier was most likely going die regardless of what he did. It may have also been his *wish* to die... as are many others. It is considered a type of honor for the afterlife." Elfriede frowns a bit.

"Maybe you should reserve your judgement until we reach Lyall, its truly beautiful... These is the far reaches of the Kingdom after all, everyone is more on edge here with the threat of Dreca so close at hand. Eraia is certainly one for rituals, but that doesn't mean that we're wrong for believing such things either."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

"Yes, that's possibly the case, but no one even attempted to help the man. He arrived at the town alive, and not a single medical mage stepped forward. _I_ would have helped him, and he isn't even a citizen of my country, but to have stepped forward would be to put the diplomacy between Callora and Eraia at jeopardy," Afina replies, a patronizing tone slowly seeping into her voice. Her eyes become downcast as she thinks about the implications her visit has for international relations. 

Elfriede suggests suspending her judgements, and Afina sighs. "I would not suggest Eraia to be wrong for practicing religion as they wish. It is perhaps, forcing it on others, that I find more rude. The people here wouldn't have been kind to our party had it been simply myself and Atalantia."  

Afina's hands begin to nervously thumb the pin that bears her family sigil on her cloak. "You know, Eraia and Callora are, at best, cordial for the moment. But it's become increasingly clear to me that their conflict is infinitely complex. Even moreso because it very well may be my rule that decides where Laera stands in an inevitable conflict. I don't want fighting, but I don't think the treatment here is necessarily fair."

Despite the harsh tone, Afina's anxious fidgeting and careful choice of words showed her restraint. The Afina of a week ago would be more given to an argument; the princess hoped that Elfriede would at least give her credit on such a development.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-22*

"Ah, yes I understand where that comes from. Not *everyone* of course agrees that force should be used for conversion, hence the push for peace as of late. Of course some people are just tired of war and others think that if Eraia wasn't fighting Dreca and had more resources they'd branch out again... I of course hope that not to be true. Dreca's warmongering ways I can get behind fighting, but I have never been involved with a fighting against Callora and I hope to never be."

Faun carefully avoids a patch of stones that his keener then normal night vision picked up and leads Lady Tyndall around it.

"I believe that to be the **hubris** of man and not the will of the Goddess that we love so much. That just doesn't make sense to me..."

Elfriede shifts uncomfortably and grabs his upper arm. "All I'm saying is I understand... I cant really fix anything... but I wish Eraia was different in a few key ways... as I'm sure many think of their own countries."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

_I have never been involved with a fighting against Callora and I hope to never be._ Afina visibly relaxes, as if that was exactly what she needed to hear. For some reason, she felt proud of Elfriede. Perhaps because he was self-assured in where his alliances lay. 

"I think that is fair. Perhaps more journeying will reveal a softer side to Eraia. The religious fervor on the border is justifiably due to the conflict arising there." 

Afina nods. "Thank you, Elfriede, for providing so much counsel in these travels. I don't believe I've properly thanked you for your service. Back home, a ruler would have her council, her tutor, and her friends. But it seems you are much accustomed to performing the duties of all three." 

She cocks her head a little bit. "And you know a ruler will always help those who help her. So if you find yourself in need of something, don't hesitate to ask, yes?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-22*

Elfriede nods solemnly. "Although I dont believe you'll find Lyall has any less religious fervor, but a the very least people will be in much higher spirits. My family... although stern, were once foreigners themselves, I'm confident they'll treat you with respect, especially considering who you are." He relaxes and chuckles a bit.

"And do not mention it, I am only trying to allow you a window into my understanding of my home. I thank you for your compliments and your gracious offer." He smiles genuinely and bows slightly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

She smiles. “Looking forward to it. It will be quite interesting to meet the people who raised an upstanding knight such as yourself. I have no doubts that _all_ the Fauns are as friendly and hospitable as yourself.”

Afina purses her lips slightly at Elfriede’s bow, a little disappointed that the knight held such formalities, even when they were engaged in friendly conversation. “Feel no need to bow, Elfriede. Though we began this journey as charge and escort, I’m proud to call you a dear friend now. Which means there is no standard for bowing.”

Afina hesitates for a split second, unsure how to convey the warmth in her statement. She decides that a pat on the upper arm shall suffice.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-02-22*

The knight laughed a bit nervously. He honestly hoped his parents did not disappoint, after all they weren't bad people just... matter of fact in.. ways... He silently wondered to himself on the slim chance that his sister would be home. He'd like Afina to meet her.

Elfriede unsure how to react to Afina's declaration of friendship and dropping of formalities felt flush with embarrassment. "Aah, y-yes I'll be sure to act... more casual.. Ms. Tyn--. Afina." He said while desperately fighting off the urge to bow again apologetically. 

Although he was happy. He had been feeling along similar lines lately. Faun was definitely feeling a closeness with his companions that he hadn't felt in a long time. The thoughts, emotions and his sudden want to see them far from the border was throwing him off... but it felt warm.

[Endu Asideru]

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

```
Characters: Afina Tyndall, Elfriede Faun
Location: Ebonary Inn
```

The three retired to the inn soon after, each member of their party getting their own room. Afina hesitated as she turned the key to her room, glancing down the hall as her companions entered their own rooms. This was the first time she had been truly alone since their journey had begun. How long had it been? A week exactly? It was difficult to keep track while on the road. 

Afina closed the door behind her, sighing as she sat down on the side of the bed. She took off her shoes and tossed them across the room, and unpinned her brooch so her cape fell to the bed behind her. The princess changed into her nightgown, and soon began to brush her hair. 

Was it right to have called the harbormaster on that crew? They _were_ exhibiting suspicious behavior. But maybe… she had been making assumptions. Were they suspicious to her _because_ they were laguz? Afina frowned. _No, that couldn’t be it, the crew had suspicious behavior, disregarding their appearance entirely_.

Afina tried to shake the thought from her mind, standing up and beginning to pace the room. The floorboards began to creak under her feet, and she sat back down with a huff. She was far too energetic to go to bed. 

The princess shoved her feet into her white slippers, and grabbed the inn’s blanket to wrap around her shoulders, before walking down the hall. She hesitated, glancing between Atalantia’s door and Elfriede’s. Atalantia was someone she should be forging a better companionship with… but Elfriede was already someone she could trust. Afina knocked on the knight’s door. “Elfriede?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

Elfriede stood alone in his room. He went through his normal nightly routine now that he was alone and had a private sleeping place. He removed his traveling gear and began changing into sleeping clothes the inn had provided. 

The boy stood in his underclothes and extended his cramped tail as far as he could stretch it whilst staring at his chest plate. It was of course adorned with the symbol of Eraia; the two feathers: One white, One Black, each symbolizing light and dark among many other small details. He had worn this armour for quite some time since leaving military school, as it already was marked with 3-4 cuts where it has saved his life. 

Suddenly and unexpectedly a light knock on the door and a soft voice calling for him. Elfriede gasped loudly and dropped his armour. In that moment he reached for it quickly to no avail. **clang** 

"I-I.. Yes Afina, what do you need?! I mean! One sec!" he said rather hurriedly as he rushed to put on his sleep wear.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina jumped back from the door as a metallic clang rang from the other side. What had Elfriede been up to? “If… this is an inconvenient time I can just reach you later?” she offered awkwardly, unsure as to whether choosing to talk to Elfriede was proving to be the best alternative to sleep.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

Lots of movement can be heard on the other side of the door. "No! It's quite alright!" Eventually the movement moves over to he door which unlatches an opens to a concerned Elfriede.

"Is everything okay?!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina blinks a few times, bewildered, though appreciative of Elfriede’s concern. “Oh… oh yes, everything is quite fine! I just could not seem to find sleep is all,” Afina laughed awkwardly. “It appears that you seem to have the same issue,” she said, glancing over Elfriede’s shoulder at the armor that now lay on the ground. “If you’re fit for company at this hour, at least. I understand if you need your personal time after so long spent with Atalantia and myself.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

"No, no please come in. I actually had just gone down for some tea before retiring. It helps me relax sometimes after.... stressful traveling." He motions for her to sit down at the very small table that was in the room, it was nothing fancy, just a small and simply built out of pine, but had two chairs. "I have the leaves and the hot water here if you would care for some."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina enters the room, gratefully sitting down to tea. It had been a long while since she had had tea, possibly months. Her mother drank it, and though Afina had no personal taste for the beverage, she had always joined her mother for tea sessions. “I’ll have some, thank you kindly,” she nodded, pulling the blanket closer around herself.

“Strange, actually. I would have thought that military training would oust such an art form out of someone like yourself,” Afina observed. She knew Elfriede was a noble, so she should not have been all that surprised; Perhaps seeing Elfriede primarily whilst traveling had colored her view of him. Afina made a strong mental note of such.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

"Hahaha, I wouldn't consider tea an art form myself." He says as he steeps the tea leaves into the hot water. "We just drank it a lot when I was growing up so I like it every once in a while to relax and remind myself when my responsibilities were much less." He puts his elbow on the edge of the table and rests his chin in his hand.

"So... you sure nothing is wrong, you just came here to chat Afina?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

_Great, now Elfriede must be under the assumption that I only wish to talk when I’m upset, I must have complained one too many times_, Afina thinks. But she dismisses Elfriede’s question with a wave of her hand. “Yes, nothing is wrong. It’s a Laeran quality. Constantly thinking and never quite settling to sleep,” she said. This wasn’t entirely a lie; many Laerans _did_ suffer from lack of sleep, but not enough to be a substantial trend. “Just mulling through the day’s events is all. I’m excited to be travelling by a method other than walking, for once,” she smiled. “Never really travelled by boat in Callora.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

"I definetly share your sentiment there. My legs are ready for a bit of rest. Even with all the military conditioning..." 

Elfriede leans back in his chair a bit. "You've never been on a boat? Like at all? Well it'll either be a fantastic experience or a terrible one.... or sometimes a bit of both. The water is truly beautiful way out there, but at the same time there isnt much to do and thats not to mention sea sickness if it hits ya. Luckely it'll be less then a week at sea; conditions depending, 3? maybe 5 days? some people stay out at sea over a month. I dont know how they do it." 

The knight leuitenant removes the leaves and pours two cups of tea.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

“Yes, one must get lonely on the sea for so long. Of course, you always have your crew and fellow workers, but to be estranged from your family and friends for so long…” Afina’s voice trails off as she realizes the exact situation applied to both herself and Elfriede. He must’ve spent months away at military training, and she had spent quite a while passing time in Theanovene, waiting for her family to retrieve her. She changes the subject abruptly. 

“So what do you plan to do once your mission is complete and we reach Trisp?” she inquires, genuinely curious. Afina hoped that, at the minimum, Elfriede would be somewhere close enough for mail correspondence. He was proving to be an invaluable source of advice and assistance. And surely he would wish to stay in contact as well.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

Elfriede looks down at the table for a moment. "... I most likely will return home for a bit, then after a short time I will return to active duty. That could be other missions such as this, could be staying to gaurd the homefront, and even could be... sent to Dreca. I know not what my future holds Afina. I haven't thought about it much since meeting up with you to be honest."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina’s mouth gapes in surprise. She hadn’t even considered the war with Dreca. The conflict was so far outside her own sphere of influence that she had not believed there to be even a remote chance of Elfriede joining that fight. “I see,” she says quietly, hands beginning to fidget with her blanket. 

The princess was at a loss for words, for one of the few times in her life. _What was she to say? What a shame?_ or _I’m proud you can serve your nation as such_? Eraians lived to serve their goddess, but… the idea upset Afina. She thought such a cause to be useless and dumb. Why worry about the next life when you’re living in one now? But even Elfriede admitted to not being the staunchest of supporters of Lylalel. “Yes, well. That is to be expected of a knight after all.”

A few moments of awkward silence persisted between the two as Elfriede drank his tea and Afina stared at hers. Elfriede was a disciplined and devoted knight. This was the way of the world. Regardless if she had made friends or not, this was his duty. Their meeting had begun as a simple escort mission, after all.

Afina’s hands cupped the mug of tea, its smooth surface warming her hands. She had already written to her father that Elfriede would make an excellent addition to the Calloran guard. Obviously she appreciated Elfriede, as a friend and as a knight. But the idea was preposterous, and Afina bit her tongue. 

“Perhaps you could consider making a habit of escort missions. I find few other knights so well qualified for the job. It would be a shame to waste such a talent,” Afina said, forcing herself to make eye contact once more, and hoping her tone of voice did not betray her.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

After a few moments of silence Afina spoke up. "Yes well.. Thank you.. and I appreciate your friendship, you've been very kind to me. I will definetly attempt to keep in touch no matter where they send me. Besides, who knows what will happen between here and Trisp." He says with a smile. "Perhaps the war will miraculously end in the next few weeks?" he say and chuckles a tiny bit. "Regaurdless we can enjoy what time we have left traveling together." 

*Trying to lighten the mood a bit... but... the selfish feeling is there. Leaving feels... wrong? still... I'm a knight of the Faun name. I would never desert. Why would something so simple minded even cross my mind...* 
Faun scrambled through his thoughts a bit while sipping his tea.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina was never particularly good at hiding her thoughts. The awkward silence that filled the space between them once more was unbearable. Afina opened her mouth to speak, before deciding against it and taking a sip of her tea. She was not particularly confident in where she stood with Elfriede. How honest could she _be_ with him? Perhaps if she played off her thoughts as a joke…

“Yes, we should enjoy such time. To live in the moment, as many would say.” She set down her cup. “How interesting to think, had you been a Calloran, your skill would certainly qualify you for the king’s guard. Odd how pivotal circumstances can be, you know?”

_There._ Even if it wasn’t a direct suggestion, Afina had managed to vocalize herself. Perhaps if Elfriede just happened to _think_ about the idea… Well. Nothing was guaranteed. But the king’s guard would someday be Afina’s queen’s guard. And the princess knew that she only wanted to most fitting of knights to surround her. Afina saw Elfriede’s response. _Perhaps now would be a proper time to return to my room_, she thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

Elfriede smiled despite having so much on his mind at the moment. "Yes perhaps in another life, if I was born elswhere to a different family... In Laera. Entertaining such fantasies is blasphemy you know." He held a stern visage for a breif moment after saying it before cracking a smile and laughing a bit. "I suppose I'd be protecting your father then at this moment. And I wouldn't be escorting you at this very moment. Then you would have another, clearly inferior knight guiding you at this moment. It could have been *Ransford*."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina laughed in response, nervously at first, but genuinely once she realized Elfriede had been joking. She had been worried that her comment would’ve offended the dedicated knight, but Elfriede seemed capable of laughing it off. Afina appreciated that. “Ah, yes, Ransford. Everyone’s favorite knight.” The idea was so far-fetched that Afina couldn’t help but keep laughing. She wondered how long it had been since she had such a good laugh. 

“Then perhaps I’m glad we met under the circumstances we did. I had a tendency to ignore all those uptight knights in my father’s guard. Now the _queen’s_ guard, however…” she said with a smirk. “It seems I must write my appeals to Ransford for such a position soon. Should he forget the favors we did for him.” 

Afina sets down her mug, surprisingly empty of tea. The engaging conversation and awkward silences both had driven her to keep drinking without even realizing it. The princess stood. “Thank you, Elfriede, I thoroughly appreciated the conversation and tea. It seems once again you have proven to be a great help.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

"Like wise." Elfriede said with a smirk. 
"Although I thought you said nothing was wrong Miss Tyndall?" He teased. 

"Hopefully you can sleep now after drinking the tea. It's supposedly a relaxing blend."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina pulled her blanket around her once more, sauntering towards the door. “Oh? Though I say nothing is wrong, you chose the relaxing blend. It seems you’re more astute than you look. Maybe you should be offered the shrewd top advisor position as opposed to queen’s guard.” Afina turns to hover by the doorway. Elfriede does the same, and she hesitates for a moment. Afina wanted to properly convey her gratitude; Elfriede had contributed so much to her that the princess was unsure she would ever be able to pay him back. 

Elfriede reached forward to open the door for her, and Afina spares but a quick moment to glance into the hallway. Elfriede had made a valid point; neither of them knew what the future might bring, even as a reserved person, Afina should be upfront with her appreciation. Should tragedy befall them on their journey, Afina could at least take solace in the fact that she expressed the true level of care she felt for her friends. 

As Elfriede turns to bid goodnight, Afina abruptly steps forward and embraces him. Her arms thrown over his shoulders, their similar heights put the two cheek to cheek. Afina smiles softly. “I truly mean it, Elfriede. Thank you. For everything.” 

As the two separate, Afina nods a joyful “goodnight”, before disappearing down the hallway towards her own room.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-08*

Elfriede stood up taking Afina's slight teasing with a smirk. He walked her over to the door to return to her quarters. "I appreciated the converstion before b--" Elfriede is cut off by a sudden embrace by Afina. "The sudden gesture caused Elfriede to gasp lightly. He slowly brought his arms up and around her to embrace her back. Elfriede couldn't find any words as they separated. He smiled as she backed out of the room with a "Goodnight." 

"Goodnight Afina." he managed to say before she turned to return to her quarters. 

"I am truly greatful to you as well." He said softly to himself as he shut the door.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Afina had nearly run down the hallway, managing to keep her pace to a moderate fast walk. She entered her room, and closed the door behind her, harder than she meant to. The door shuddered in its frame, and the princess hoped that the noise had not startled Atalantia next door. The princess climbed into her bed, hands over her mouth in shock. 

After years of her friends filtered out by her parents. And years of people avoiding the princess because of her famous name. After years of even her best friends being reserved, boring intellectuals who never dared touch the princess. Afina grinned wide, hugging her pillow to her chest. She had finally made a true friend on her own terms, who was dedicated and loyal and helpful, and unafraid to own up to their friendship. 

The princess collapsed backwards to lay on the bed. Though their journey to Eraia had been wrought with tragedy and discomfort, it seemed that things were finally turning around. Afina shifted onto her side, pushing the pillow back under her bed. The moonlight filtered in through the window, throwing rays of light across the room where the small, white candle could not penetrate the darkness. Afina sighed happily, a small smile still playing across on her face. A year ago, Afina would not have believed it. But this was where she was now. 

Afina would be sure to approach Atalantia with more openness; the building of friendships was infectious. She was determined to make more. She closed her eyes, feeling relaxed and comfortable. Tomorrow would most definitely be a good day.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-29*

Elfriede nearly fell over after he shut the door, clearly overwhelmed with emotion. All the thoughts polluting his mind of the future and Eraia as a whole were suddenly flushed away in that moment. It had been a long time since Elfriede let himself get close to someone. He walked over to his bed and fell into it.

New emotions took the place of the old. He was glad, and also scared. He didnt want to lose them, he didnt want to separate from them. Faun searched for the words that spawned these feelings of happiness, but yet the want to *protect*.  He shook his head into his pillow. No. He should take his own advice and enjoy the time he has with them. 

As he slowly drifted to sleep it occured to him... *When was the last time he was hugged... by anyone...?* and he smiled.
Tomorrow would most definitely be a good day.

Elfriede's eyes slowly drifted opened from what seemed like a deep sleep and he glanced around the room. Afina sat in a lone chair to the left of the foot of the bed, her head tilted to one side as her chest slowly rose and fell. *Had she fallen asleep in here? Why would sh--* Faun went to shift his body and paralyzing pain shot throughout his body from his abdomen causing him to yelp and lay right back down. It refreshed his memory quickly. His eyes drifted back over to Afina who started to stir from his yelp.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

Afina had meant to nap for a few minutes at most, but the fatigue of battle had made her weary. The sailors had let her sleep, even draping a blanket over her bare shoulders during the course of her sleep. A small yelp roused her, and the princess blinked herself awake. She sat up straight, and stretched her arms. With a start, she realized that Elfriede was awake. "Elfriede, are you alright?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-29*

"I'm alive." He said with a smile finally understanding his predicament. "In no small part to you I'm sure. I'm not entirely sure what happened, but Thank you." Elfriede looked to his stomach which was now wrapped in bandages that were soaked through a bit with blood. His arm was sore but felt better at least. Each breathe he now took caused pain in his abdomen. "I'm sorry I got us in that predicament...."

"What about you? Are you okay?!" He said suddenly as he started noticing all the cuts, burns and blood on her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

"I... well, yes. I guess it _was_ because of me that we escaped. In a last-ditch effort I attempted a particularly challenging light spell. It would seem luck was on our side that it worked. Or rather... _my_ side." She laughed lightly. 

"As for my injuries, they're few in number." Afina lifted her forearm to find that it had been wrapped in a neat, white bandage. "While my appearance may suggest that I was gravely injured, I was mostly just fatigued. I'm just glad we're getting to Lyall soon. My father should have sent some new clothes and books for us there." 

"I also, um, grabbed your sword before we retreated," Afina said, motioning towards the rapier that laid upon the desk. Flecks of blood, now dry, still coated the blade. "Though perhaps I should hold onto it myself if you insist on being the princess and making myself the knight," she beamed.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-29*

"A-ah. Very good then... Thanks for retrieving my sword. I'll probably have to get a new side arm in short order after our return." 
Elfriede went to snap back a retort about how he put himself in more danger precisely because of the fact that he ***was*** the knight, but he recognized it as an excuse for his overwhelming embarrassment.  "I... yeah... I'm sorry I caused so much trouble for you... Thank you again... I dont know how I'll ever repay the debt... If you would like a less reckless, higher ranking knight to escort you to Trisp once we return to Lyall... I'm sure my family could arrange such a thing."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

Afina waved her hand, not feeling particularly in need of an apology. "You challenged several dozen laguz and only lost after repeated injury. No one could blame you after fighting like that, Elfriede. No need to apologize." Afina hadn't meant to upset Elfriede, but perhaps making light of the situation didn't help the knight's wounded pride. His offer to renounce his mission made his embarrassment quite clear. The princess felt bad for him; Elfriede was serious about his duty. To have died in combat would be to have failed his mission.

Afina stood from the chair to sit on the end of the bed. "You know, I don't think you were watching, but I actually defeated the last enemy mage with my sword as opposed to my spells. Quite fortunate that you've been teaching me then, hm?" She said, head cocked, trying to catch his distant gaze.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-29*

His glazed over eyes opened wider and he couldn't help but smile. "Thats great!-- ahh!" Elfriede tried to sit up again in excitement but fell back down as soon as his abdominal muscles tried to flex to lift him. 

Even through the pain he managed to laugh at what a fool he was. "I'm a bit simple minded when it comes to some things so it seems." He laughed a bit again and smiled. "That's fantastic. I'm really glad."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

Afina smiled back. "Yes, I imagine that pirate is going to be quite upset if she can't find those two fingers she's now missing, thanks to a certain Laeran. And her genius Eraian tutor's instruction." 

Afina crossed her feet, now fully facing Elfriede. "And this aforementioned genius tutor is... going to be alright, yes?" she asked hesitantly. "I'm not angry. But you very much scared me. Had we been taken prisoner I doubt they would've been kind to you, and _then_ who would I learn swordsmanship from?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-29*

Elfriede sighed somewhat relieved. He *had* done well in the battle after all. "Perhaps next time I should not get so over zealous. I am obviously a fantastic teacher after all." He chuckled a bit.

After a few moments of silence Elfriede spoke up about the obvious. "I don't think ill be moving until we at least get to Lyall. Hopefully the captain is thankful of all we did today and forgives me for not helping out around the boat." He smirked slightly. "I guess that means I'll need my meals brought to me for the next few days."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

Afina rolled her eyes with a smile. "It's a good thing that there's a plethora of strapping, young sailors on this ship, then. Least you go hungry." 

The princess stood, and started walking towards the door. "Just this once I'll bring you a meal, if only because I must change clothes anyways. If you breathe a word of this to anyone, though. I will kill you, Elfriede Faun." 

Afina hovered in the doorway for a moment, as if she had more to say. She didn't think Elfriede comprehended just _how_ scared she had been. To be fair, she had not been particularly forthright either, hiding her concern under light-hearted jokes and comments. But nonetheless, she didn't want to lose a friend to such reckless behavior, and felt like she had to make that known to Elfriede. 

"I'll be back later with food, alright?" She said, rather quickly, abruptly ducking out and closing the door behind her. _No_, she thought. _Now wasn't the time to admonish the knight for running off. He already felt guilty enough as it was._ Afina sighed. She would have to tell him in earnest later. The princess wiped away a single tear that had seemed to make its way down her cheek. Perhaps that was a sign that the stress of travel was finally getting to her.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-31*

Faun smiled genuinely at the wayward Princess's retort. "Thanks Fina!"

However, as soon as the door closed, the silence brought back the selfdoubt that was covered by the chatter. He began to over and over again brow-beat himself about failing her. Elfriede imagined himself from her perspective as he fell and his heart panged and sped up. He continuously went over all the things he did wrong in the fight. The recklessness he showed in the thrill of battle. He was embarassed at his poor decision making. *If only I was just more aware.* Faun took careful mental notes of all his mistakes as his smile from the light hearted converstaion turned into a frown. 

He thought of Yuria and his parents. *If only I was better...*

Characters: Afina, Elfriede```

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

The sun had just set by the time Afina approached Elfriede once more. She had spent much of the rest of the day walking around the deck, practicing her magic, and staring out at the ocean. Nothing in particular had grasped her interest; the princess’ mind was occupied with other matters. _How am I going to make sure that Elfriede doesn’t put himself in that situation again?_ she thought, pacing in the corridor that connected the living quarters. 

She held a tray tightly in her hands, with two cups of tea on it. He had appreciated the drink when she had talked with him the other night. Surely it would be a welcome gesture once more. Afina stopped pacing, looking down and frowning into the cups. Afina would have to be firm; she wanted the knight to understand the gravity of the situation. Her chest felt tight as she recalled his scared expression on the enemy ship. 
 
Taking a deep breath, Afina knocked once and entered Elfriede’s bunk. “Feeling better yet?” she asked nervously, holding up the tray slightly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-31*

Elfriede was broken from his trance of reading when Afina entered. He had been trying to keep his mind from dwelling on the events earlier. Thinking about it for so long seemed to be doing more bad then good. He looked up to her.

"Not much I'm afraid, the first few days are always the worst, even with magical assistance." He said rather melancholic. "And.. yourself?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

“I’m alright,” she said, closing the door behind her. 

“We need to discuss some things,” Afina continued, setting the tray down on the side table near Elfriede’s bed. “There must be significant improvements in your battle strategy if we’re to have a most successful voyage to Trisp. Current tactics have resulted in questionable and disappointing results, so obviously changes must be made.” Afina fidgeted with the fabric of her nightgown. Her voice was controlled and her expression firm. _That’s right, make him know not to be so reckless_.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-31*

Elfriede gripped his covers tightly. His reaction made him feel defensive. He wanted to explain that he was far more effective in the center of everything. But his points all fell short because of the simple fact that hurting the enemy more was not his primary job.

"I've been thinking a lot about it myself. I have always been an all in type in combat... But that type of outlook has put us both in danger multiple times already... My duty is to protect you...not defend this ship.. To that end.. I'd like to apologize again."
Faun closes his eyes and bows slightly. "I'll try to stay with you more Lady Tyndall. I'm sorry for my reckless behavior."
Although he attempted to sound apologetic, he came across as defeated.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Afina hesitated. She wanted to tell Elfriede that it was alright, but nothing was ever accomplished by a weak leader. She pressed on. “Clearly. When we first departed Theanovene, you promised to remain committed to your duty. But as time has passed, such a goal has fallen to the wayside. Your apology is accepted, but without changes in your behavior, it will mean nothing to me.” Afina remained tense and straight, her face a grave expression unbecoming of the normally lively princess. 

“There is no more room for mistakes,” she said, as the threat of tears stung her eyes. She blinked them back with a sigh.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-31*

Elfriede looked down at the book he was reading. This situation felt rather familiar... Nothing he wasn't used to already. Being scolded while he silently nodded and agreed... 

Faun nods without bringing his gaze up. "It won't happen again."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Afina's heart sank as Elfriede lowered his head in shame. She felt legitimately caught between admonishing him for his own safety, and comforting the crestfallen knight.  She was scolding him _because_ she cared, she had to remind herself of that. He was a knight lieutenant in the military; Elfriede could take a little constructive criticism. Nevertheless, Afina felt her vision blur as it became more difficult to hold back her tears. 

"I don't want to see-." The princess' voice broke on the last word, and she tried to cough to cover up her sign of upset. "I don't want to see a display like that of last battle ever again."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-31*

Faun recognized how upset she was in that moment, lifting his head and glancing up at her. Once again his mind went to how she must ahve felt in the moment when he was struck. 

"Fina.. I understand, I'm sorry for making you worry. I've been rather foolish."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Afina blinked and a tear rolled down her cheek. “Don’t be stupid I-... you’re a capable knight you’re just-” The princess wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. _There goes trying to seem serious and harsh_, she thought, unsure of what to say now that Elfriede saw how she truly felt. Looking at him, Afina could see the concern on his face. 

“I don’t want you to be more careful for my sake. You’re too smart to get hurt-- almost killed!-- in petty fights with _laguz pirates_ of all people!”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-03-31*

"I thought I... just in that moment... I felt so useless... That I was going to die, and you'd be captured. The whole journey and our lives would have been for naught." He had already been on the brim, and tears are contagious they say. Fauns eyes began to tear up, he looked away trying to save some sense of his pointless masculinity.

"I'm sorry I dont have more to say, someway to ensure that I promise..." He paused to lightly wipe his eyes with his hand. "I'll take better care of myself."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-01*

Afina nodded, continuing to wipe her tears on her nightgown. “When we started this endeavor, you told me you were to guard me from all harm, yes? As we continue our way to Trisp, keep this promise in mind.” She took his hand in two of her own, and squeezed reassuringly. For herself, or Elfriede’s own benefit, she wasn’t entirely sure. “Treat all harm to yourself as equal in weight as harm to me.”

“I know that this means asking you to disobey your orders to put escorting me above all else, but I believe combat has shown that, while I do not fight in the same disciplines as yourself, I can hold my own. After this time that has passed, I believe us to be more equals than escort and princess. Can you promise this?” 

Afina was wary about such a proposal. Elfriede had always taken his duties very seriously. She wasn’t sure what response she would receive. But a “maybe” would be better than nothing.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-01*

Thoughts were swirling through his mind like a vortex. 

*Before I answer that... I have to ask...why do you care so much for me?!*
Is what he wanted to ask..

"I-It would be against my orders." He tightened his hold on her hands slightly. "But what you say is truth, there's no denying your combat prowess. Though I don't know what it is you see in me, or.. rather *value* in me... I will do my best to listen to your wishes."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-01*

“Thank you, I am grateful that you consider my wishes, even when they conflict with your duty. You’re a dear friend Elfriede, probably the first friend I’ve made without my parents’ involvement. And though we met from knight’s duties and diplomatic obligations alone, I’ve come to feel like you’re as important as family to me. This is why you must take care of yourself.” Afina pats his hand one last time, before standing up. “I’m sorry for sounding so harsh. I… seeing you so scared was like having my own foundation shaken.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-01*

Elfriede nodded wiping his eyes once more and then gazing at her. He opened his mouth to speak but anything he could say sounded wrong. How could he tell her no. He couldn't keep thanking her for caring for him either. However, he was extremely thankful and if he was being honest, he didn't know how to deal with someone showing him so much care.

Faun just smiled at her and nodded sincerely.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

Afina smiled back. "I'll see you in the morning then, Elfriede. After all, how will you eat if no one serves you, in your condition." She bowed her head slightly. "Goodnight." Afina closed the door behind her, and shakily exhaled as she faced the wall. It was stressful to know that an individual could have such influence over her actions, but perhaps this was the price of friendship. _At least Elfriede won't be so reckless now_, she thought, walking back down the hallway towards her room.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-02*

"Goodnight Fina." he said before she exited and closed the door.

Elfriede fell face into hands trying to process all the emotions and thoughts flying through his head. In the absence of conversation, he became aware of the throbbing pain in his stomach that came and went. The feeling of loneliness creeped back in on him as he layed down. Something about being bedridden didnt sit right with him.

*Although...* Faun smiled. "I cant say that I mind a princess bringing me food every day."

After so much time spent on the boat, Afina similarly insisted that they stop for food. She was rightfully tired of the food they had been given while at sea. As they sat down, Afina looked over the menu. _What IS half of this?_  she wondered.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-05*

Elfriede sat down with her and perused the menu a bit. "Might I suggest something you haven't tried before? Perhaps a dish with fish and Eraian sauces?"
He spent some time pointing out different meals and explaining them.

The waiter approached them and asked if they'd like to order, but then abruptly stopped. "Ahh your the Faun boy right? Thank you for you service and devotion to Lylalel's light." The former being in Erain. He paused for another brief moment glancing Afina's way. "I see you have a foreigner with you, I hope you enjoy your stay in Lyall ma'am. I'll be right back with some drinks if you'll excuse me.

Elfriede looked back to Afina. "Ahh, he said-" but was silenced by her raised hand.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

"Thank you for your service to Lylalel's... light?" she said, beaming. "My tutor from childhood was Eraian. I managed to learn enough here and there to manage simple phrases. Surprised, Elfriede?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-05*

"A-ah! I'm actually impressed! Proving yourself to be full of suprises, though I suppose I shouldn't be surprised with your royal education." Faun saidd with a smirk.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Afina shrugged with a coy smile. “Laeran education has always been quite thorough,” she said, gazing about the small food shop. She paused, noticing a stack of papers sitting by the glow of a white candle. She stood up and walked towards the paper, the words “Trisp” catching her eyes. The shopkeeper gave Afina a quizzical stare, before the princess quickly produced a gold coin to pay for the paper. The shopkeeper, obviously quite busy, smiled contently and pocketed the coin as Afina took a copy of the Theanovene Almanac from the pile. 

“Trisp’s Prodigy?” she read aloud, her finger tracing over the words as she sat down once more. “They… have a prodigy. Already there?”

The princess traced her finger over the words as she read them. _They have a light mage that’s more proficient than anyone the Cardinal’s ever seem!?_ Afina’s grip tightened around the paper, the almanac crinkling and crumpling in her grasp. _Blessed by Lylalel? What kind of indolent explanation is that? Everyone knows that it takes hard work and dedication and years of practice to garner such a proficiency in light magic!_. The light magic tomes in the princess’ backpack suddenly felt heavier as she clutched the paper tightly. _Is this some kind of joke?_

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-05*

Elfriede rests one hand on her back as she stared inquisitively at the paper clearly stressed out about its contents. Elfriede took a quick glance and understood.

"Just because they have someone who is good at light magic there doesn't mean you cannot also . This person has no bearing over you or your skills Fina." He said rather sternly. He had forgotten that she had acted childish and entitled at times. Although... he understood the roots of her jealousy for he wasn't above such feelings himself.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

"I..." Afina couldn't find the words to say how she felt. She was upset that the Cardinal had invited her with such grandeur, only to see that they had someone better all along. This light mage hadn't even worked hard for their skills! The princess pocketed the almanac in her pack, shaking her head. "Let's just eat and get to your house."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

Elfriede nodded, sighed lightly and sat back down.

Faun swoled around at her off-putting response. "And what would you have them do? Hide away the information that my sister may be dead or captured?" He stared at her confused.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

"No?" Afina said, brows furrowing. "I simply mean that they seemed not to have the situation under control themselves. To be yelling and arguing, as it sounded like they were. They don't need to be doing that in front of their injured and duty-occupied son. You're already perturbed enough by... you know..." She gestured to his abdomen, where white gauze still hid the true nature of his wound.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

"This is trivial.." he says glancing down. " It's my duty to know and try to do something about Yuria. How am I supposed to say we're family if I didn't care enough to know that she might be dead or captured?!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

"I'm not saying you should willfully keep yourself ignorant, Elfriede. Your parents were just awfully atrocious at putting the fact to you lightly. As such, now it's only going to impede your emotional welfare," she says matter-of-factly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

"My *emotional welfare* would have been impeded either way. Best to get it over early..." He sighs lightly. "It doesnt matter anyway... I cant do anything right now. First I have to get this wound taken care of.."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

"Exactly. Besides, you said your sister was--uh, is an exemplary fighter. This is likely intel being lost through the military. I cannot imagine a prestigious _Laeran_ army leader being captured. Much less an Eraian one with how seriously your culture takes its military," Afina nodded. She glanced around the room, hoping Elfriede would offer her a seat. He had yet to do so;  Such a rude gesture was unlike the knight.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

Elfriede grits his teeth a bit fighting back tears. "She IS." Faun looks to her glancing around. *Is she even paying attention.* 

Faun stands facing her. "Anyone can be overpowered if the number difference is high enough. Look what almost happened on the pirate ship! No amount of training can prepare someone for every situation. Military is a dangerous occupation as I'm sure you've noticed. I know you haven't experienced a lot of the real world locked in your castles but thats how it is."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

“Locked in your castle! What is wrong with you, Elfriede. How many children’s tales have you been reading lately? Do you think I was sitting there wasting away in Theanovene, waiting for a knight in shining armor to save me?” _Where was all this anger coming from?_, she wondered, analyzing Elfriede’s face. His features were tense. “Obviously I’ve noticed how dangerous it is in the military, I’ve been travelling with you for two whole weeks.” She folds her arms and mumbles, “I’ve saved you enough times to notice, and you hardly seem grateful.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

Elfriede scowled at her. "I *have* been grateful, but half of those situations we wouldn't have even been in if your self righteousness didnt *lead* us there." He breathed out trying to calm himself. "Regaurdless. You can stay in this room until I figure out what we are doing." He started to walk passed to to leave the room; he felt his temperment boiling and he didnt want to lose himself.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

Elfriede began to walk past her to leave, and Afina grabbed him by the upper arm. “You can’t just walk away in the middle of a conversation because you’re uncomfortable. If we are to broach my self righteousness, then perhaps we should also touch upon your carelessness, hm? Or your stubborn unwillingness to admit that you may be weak or wrong. Or your staunch adherence to questionable morals!” Her normally vibrant eyes seemed more cold and gray than usual, as her free hand balled into a fist. The other still clutched Elfriede’s tricep rather tightly, the princess unaware that her nails were beginning to dig into his arm.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

Elfriede tensed and looked to his left at her scowling. "Questionable morals? And what pray I ask do you mean by that Fina?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

Afina paused. “Well. Your nation is full of religious zealots who take their inspiration from a mythical woman in a white dress. This bombastic culture thinks that taking a bath is more important than saving _a dying man_. I’ve been miserable since we crossed into this idiotic nation, and for good reason. It’s nonsensical and backwards culture isn’t something anyone should be subject to.”

The princess releases his arm, poking Elfriede in the chest. “_You_ are a reckless knight with an over-dedication to duty and an under-dedication to morals. And what’s more, you can’t even _do_ your duty, and instead waste time running off to make highly unnecessary kills of innocent people! Like you have the authority to decide what happens to someone’s life!” 

Afina had spent too much of her life being argumentative. She had learned that the best way to get what she wanted was to yell and insult until she got her way. She wasn’t afraid to get into Elfriede’s face. He was serving _her_ after all; he had a duty to stand down.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

"*Innocent?!*" Elfriede suddenly gripped Afina by both her upper arms hard and leaned in. "You are so niave! Please dont act haughty as if you havent killed anyone yourself. The sailor I chatted with today said he saw *quite* the opposite. *You should have seen the way your girlfriend knocked this guy down the stairs and snapped his neck?!* Does that ring any bells Miss better-then-everyone Tyndall?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

“W-what?” Afina asked, her demeanor shifting as her eyes went wide. _I didn’t… that wasn’t… there’s no way I could have..._ She couldn’t think, the only thing registering in her mind being Elfriede’s words. Sure, she had knocked that pirate down the stairs, but he had been _assaulting her_. And that surely didn’t mean he was _dead_. But if another sailor saw it…

Tears welled up in her eyes as she pushed Elfriede away. “Just leave me alone!” she yelled, starting for the door. It slammed shut behind her, rattling in its frame. Afina didn’t know where she as going, but she had to be alone. She ran down the hallway, vision blurred by the tears that threatened to run down her face. Afina found a bathroom and ducked inside, closing the door behind her. 

Afina collapsed against the door and slid to the ground, breathing hard and sniffling. She pulled her knees to her chest and buried her face in them in a half-hearted attempt to stifle the sobs. _I didn’t do it. It couldn’t be me. It’s not my fault. _ Her mind was in a flurry of distress. _I would never do that._

A movement in the corner of her eye caught Afina’s attention, and she quickly found herself looking into a full-length mirror. She looked at her dejected form, trembling and crying. _I can’t believe you killed someone_, she thought, staring at her reflection.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-08*

Elfriede collapsed on his bed, tears returning. He tried to gather some form of rational thought that elluded him. He pounded his fist against the wall hard, the boards in the wall creaked in protest. His wound throbbed with intense pain. 

All he could think about is how selfish they both were.*This whole time the illusion of caring for eachother.... Was any of it real?*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

Afina frowns as Elfriede’s parents depart, leaving her and the knight alone. Her posture relaxes, and Afina folds her arms as she leans against the back of her chair. “I see your parents are much like those of any noble. Trying to play matchmaker and such.” She doesn’t make eye contact with Elfriede, instead staring straight ahead at the wall. Her tone was formal and curt, though not necessarily aggressive. Afina had to admit, she liked Elfriede’s parents; It made it that much harder to stay mad at _him_. But didn’t want to be the first to apologize.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-17*

"Yes. That is indeed nothing new." He said straightly staring down at the table. His mind of course raced over the night before. He felt nervous and awkward. Unsure what to say to ease the air.

"How are you this morning?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

“I am well. The bed was comfortable.” She responded, electing to ignore the fact that she herself did not get quality sleep. “And you?” she asks with a nod, glancing sidelong at Elfriede quickly. _He looks nervous. Or perhaps upset. It’s no mystery as to why, but one would think with such a fiery exchange last night he would still be angry..._ she thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-17*

He glanced up to her immediately noticing slight darkness under her eyes. Realizing himself that he probably share the same condition. 

"I am.. well enough. I'm to be healed of my wound in a few minutes, so I'm sure I'll be good as new then."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

“Hm. Excellent,” she said, folding her arms. Afina suddenly remembered the curt and formal appearance of Elfriede’s mother and promptly un-folded her arms. She didn’t want to be mimicking Aria Faun’s mannerisms any time soon. They sat in silence for a few moments, and Afina cleared her throat. “So does that mean we will resume training once you’re recovered again?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-17*

"I would... Think I'd like that." He said genuinely.

He thought about what he said to her. What the sailor told him. After another brief silence he finally asked.

"Are you... Alright? Are you of sound mind?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

"Me? Alright? Of course. There isn't a reason to _be_ upset." Afina said, a hint of indignation creeping into her tone. She bites her lip, hesitating for a moment to think. "It's just. In Laera we don't _do_ that kind of thing."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-17*

Elfriede stared at her looking more and more confused by the second. What could she be describing? The fight itself? The killing? Or something else? 

"What do you mean by that? Do what kind of thing?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

"We don't. You know." Her voice lowers. "Kill people." It's clear that she looks uncomfortable just saying the phrase. "We don't have a death penalty for crimes, and convicted murderers are given life in prison. It's just. We don't. And, for the princess of Laera, the representative of her people, defender of her nation..." Afina trailed off, shaking her head. "It's shameful."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-17*

"Is it shameful to defend yourself against a Savage killer who would have ended you just as fast?!" He says through gritted teeth.

"Is it shameful to save another, by ending someone who spends thier whole life ending others?! It's niave."

He realized he started to stand up and lean in so he sat back down and took a deep breath.

"Is it shameful that your talking to me right now because *we* have killed people on this very journey here?" He gritted his teeth a bit again.
"Laera should be glad to have a strong princess who's willing to do what she has to!..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

“Strong…” Afina whispers, mulling over Elfriede’s words. Yes, perhaps she _was_ being strong. After all, if she had not killed that pirate, she may very well have been dead herself. And then where would Laera be? Without a princess? _It would be weaker, to say the least_, she thought. 

Afina was caught in a moral dilemma that, any way it was rectified, she would lose. Either she died a champion of Laera’s morals, or lived having defied them. _I can’t help my kingdom if I’m dead, though_, she thought. Maybe Elfriede had a point. 

Her mind returned back to Elfriede’s words; he had called her “strong”. Afina had never particularly thought of herself as such. She was intelligent, protective, stubborn. But strong wasn’t necessarily a trait that she ascribed to herself. In fact, she tended to assign such a trait to Elfriede more than herself. He was the one that had suffered through many hardships and stayed dedicated to his mission in times of crisis. _Even when you told him that he does the exact opposite_, she reminded herself. 

“Forgive me. You have a valid argument, I’m not use to my country if I’m dead. Perhaps being a princess demands such a sacrifice.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-17*

Elfriede crossed his arms closed his eyes and nodded. He looked away from her and suddenly and quietly said.

"... I'm sorry for yelling.."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

Afina, her own face lowered, sat up straight to look at Elfriede. However begrudgingly it was made, he had still apologized first. Whether he was talking about just now or last night, Afina didn’t know, and perhaps he meant his apology to sound vague. However, the princess was smart enough to take an olive branch when it was offered to her.

She took a deep breath, hands fidgeting in her lap. “I, too, am sorry. I apologize for insulting your country, family, and honor. I would never mean to purposely upset you.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-18*

Again he nods without looking up and there is another short silence. *In the background sounds can be heard of San approaching, with news of a healer and Afinas provisions.*

Before San arrived Elfriede quickly muttered,  "Thank you.." Immediately after saying it he felt like it wasn't the correct response to convey his feelings, but he found himself tongue tied and all sorts of awkward. Something about this situation had really thrown him off.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-24*

Afina reaches her hand out to comfort him, but hesitates hearing the sound of the door open. She lowers it, instead nodding solemnly. "We'll continue this talk later," she says. "I'd like to see what my father has sent for me."

Afina smiled as Elfriede entered the room. “Somehow it feels like I’ve asked you how you’re doing far too much recently. I don’t have to ask to see that you’ve clearly gained your energy back. Did your wounds scar?” the princess inquired. Though she addressed Elfriede, her attention was clearly divided as she shuffled the books and clothing off the other table. San quickly stepped forward to move the items for Afina.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-24*

Elfriede smiles back at her concern. "Yes.. alas.. I've had the wound too long." He lifts his shirt to reveal the area on his abdomen along with a wicked diagonal scar.

He suddenly feins heartbreak and puts one hand to his forehead and one on his chest. "Alas! My perfect body form has been ruined! Why..I'll be the shame of the town! A soldier with a scar! Unheard of!"

He snickers a bit and puffs out his chest. "I'm sure it will reduce in size over time of course, but I'll always have it."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-24*

Afina stifled a laugh behind her hand. _It seems we’re twins now_, she thought. She clasps her hands together in a similar over dramatic fashion. “You’ve brought dishonor on your title as a knight! My, how could I speak to such a pariah!” She laughs again as he takes a seat beside her. “Laerans say that you can have a mind full of ideals, but if you don’t have a scar then you’ve never really lived by them. An interesting perspective, to say the least.”

The princess motions that Elfriede take a seat beside her. “So, do I take it that you’re anxious to get back on the road again?” She question was accompanied by a melancholic smile, as she remembered that she was to return to Theanovene once her journey was complete.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

Elfriede sat down next to her after he finished his act.

"I would like to head out tomorrow morning as long as you have everything you need. I'll need to retrieve a dagger from the armory as well seeing as I lost mine. Luckely I didn't lose my family's rapier thanks to you." He shot her a smirk and bent down to pour tea.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

Afina laughed half-heartedly. _One day closer to returning back to the tower, it seems_, she thought, watching as Elfriede poured the tea. “Ah, well it was the least I could do for someone who had been doing much of the heavy lifting in the fight.” Afina bit her lip. “Are you sure you don’t want to stay home another day more? To see your family or rest or train? It will be some time before you’ll be able to rest again, I gather.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

Elfriede mulled it over in his mind a bit. He hadn't considered that as a possibility. There was also the fact that he was semi sure his parents wanted him up in the move again, but *surely* they'd understand a little training and rest, as he was pretty injured. 

"I hadn't thought of that, is that something you would like? I'm sure I could use it." He looked up to her.
"Although staying another day might subject you to more chatter from my parents of a wedding." He chuckled a bit under his breath.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

“I--” Afina pauses, looking at Elfriede. He was a dear friend, and more importantly the first close friend she had made without her father’s interference. If she couldn’t be honest with him, who _could_ she be honest with? “Actually, I would. But not because I feel I should be training or studying.”

The princess slides the letter from her father out from underneath her pile of books, folding over the parchment paper so that only the last few sentences were visible. “You see, I had thought that this journey would mean that I could finally return home and have my family deem me worthy of properly taking the throne. They said before that I was too naive and uninformed. But it, um… well, it seems not to be the case.” 

Afina awkwardly points to the last few lines of the letter. “When our time in Trisp is over, I’m afraid that I’ll be relegated back to Theanovene. It could be another year that I’m there and. I… I really want to make good use of my time outside the tower for as long as I can. I’d bear a thousand conversations about marriage if it meant more time away from Theanovene. But I know you’re also anxious to follow your sister, which would mean the expedited completion of your current mission…” Afina wrings her hands together, staring at her mug of tea.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

Faun nods in understanding and he looks down at the tea. "It's true that I would like nothing better than to find her... However I have nothing to go off of at the moment... Perhaps... One more night here wouldn't hurt... Then we must make haste over to Trisp."

He looked up to her again. "I'm sorry about the situation with your family and I wish there was something I could to other than delay the inevitable. Do... you know why they won't allow you back yet?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

"It's a Laeran cultural issue. I'm just..." she shrugs. "I'm just not smart enough for my parents to feel comfortable passing the control of the throne over to me. It's embarrassing, to say the least. One would think after 22 years on this land that I _would_ be good enough. But that's just not the way my father sees it. Most of that letter is cautions and wishing that I would develop into a greater intellectual. I'm hardly permitted to even return home to visit at this point, it seems." Afina sighs. "Perhaps this treatment seems as backwards to you as Eraia does to me."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

"... *Not smart enough?* Seriously?" Elfriede frowned. "That hardly seems fair. You seem perfectly schooled to me." He gritted his teeth a bit. "Is this common practice?!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

“For nobles? Yes, it is. I mean. It makes sense in such a way; You want your nobles to be the most intellectual individuals. And there’s a high standard for inheriting the throne. Which… is alright because my parent’s intellect was naturally passed down to me.” Afina sighed. “It’s just depressing, is all. I’m sure everything will be alright in the end, it’s just miserable to think about in the mean time.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

"..but why send you away? To Theonovane no less? I apologise, but I'm having trouble understanding thier logic Lady Tyndall.. I mean no offense."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

"They think that experiencing another culture will help. But they also fear for my safety." Afina nods. "Hence, the tower. Meanwhile, this trip to Eraia has been the most enlightening experience I've ever had, and my  father's letter does nothing but shame such an excursion."

The princess' brows furrow. "Which means you're correct, it makes no sense."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

"I guess they we're right in terms of danger.. the amount we've faced just in the journey alone has been substantial. Of course some of it could have been avoided... " He eyes her knowingly about the underground hideout that had been a topic of debate among the original party so long ago (at least it felt long). 

"Kailyn... Atalantia..." He murmured suddenly looking down again.

When they arrived in Lyall, Atalantia had left them without so much as a word and Kailyn much earlier. The topic had been undiscussed for a while, yet... Lingered. He wasn't sure how he felt on the topic, she had been a good companion and friend. He did hope to see her again someday. 

"Maybe we'll cross paths again.."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

Afina blinked, eyes glossy with the threat of tears. “We never talked about them. But. It’s lonely to think that they left and it’s just… us…” The princess trailed off, an indignant feeling rising in her chest. Elfriede was the only one who had stayed by her side through the good and the bad. Sure, he had been ordered to, but he consistently went above and beyond expectations. The training, the talking, putting up with her “self-righteousness” as he called it. Afina looked at him, eyes somber and face downcast. Was she going to let her father, who likely hadn’t even left Laera, tell her what to do? King Tyndall _conceded_ that she wouldn’t follow directions.

“No, Elfriede. After reaching Trisp, I wish to accompany you in seeking out your sister.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-25*

Elfriede eyed her with concern and his heart fell a bit. "Fina... I really appreciate it but must rally against the idea. If Yuria's squad really was taken down..." He pauses to collect himself. "I dont know what hope I'll have of finding her and freeing her, but I must try... You have your whole future ahead of you as a member of royalty and potential future.... ruler?" He said with an air of questioning. He was only making asumptions about her being in line for the throne, he didnt understand Laeran culture quite well enough and she hadn't been very vocal about her family up until now.

"A small noble house of Eraia should not be your concern... I'd be ashamed if news got to your father one day that his daughter was slain attempting to rescue an Eraian knight's lost sibling."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

"And should my father be any more proud knowing that he sent his only daughter away to be locked in a tower?" Afina asked, eyebrows raised as if she dared Elfriede to argue. "I won't go back to studying in a tower alone for years, never knowing when I can come home."

She took Elfriede's hands in her own. "I would rather support a dear friend in battle in unsure territory than waste away waiting to be deemed proper. I may never _be_ deemed proper! So especially because I can't travel home..." Afina trails off, searching Elfriede's face for a reaction. _Then perhaps home may come to travel with me_, she thought, bright determination shining in her eyes.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-26*

Elfriede failed to look her in the eyes when she grabbed his hands, staring down at them instead. Her reasoning was impressively sound, and he found it harder and harder to say no to her. "*a dear friend*" *There she goes again complimenting me unnessacarily...* He told himself, but in reality it was just to suppress and explain away his flustered demeaner that he wasn't the foundest of, which had also been cropping up more lately with *her* around. She always spoke exactly what was on her mind in the most overwhelming, upfront way that was charming in its own right. 

He turned to her clearing his throat a bit, "Alright. I see this means a lot to you. And of course the feeling is mutual." His eye lazily rose up to meet hers and he felt the fine hairs on his arm stand up a bit. His breathing picked up in the slightest. In truth it meant a lot more to him than his pride let on.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

Afina suddenly became all too aware of Elfriede's hands in hers. "Excellent!" she declared, standing up so suddenly that it shook the table. She hoped that the pale pink playing across her cheeks wasn't nearly as noticeable as it felt. _Good going Afina_, she thought to herself. "We have no need to delay then! Tomorrow morning, yes?" 

_You're speaking too loud, moving too fast, why are you acting so strange, you know how to receive guests_, she admonished herself. "Shall we train later today then?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-26*

The tea cups all rattled at the suddenjolt. Elfriede gasped audibly as Afina shot up. In the moment's reaction he also stood up.

"Y-yes! I'll have to agree!" He said rather scattered. "Training later is a fantastic idea, I'd like t-to get a hold on my current state after the... the healing." He was far too caught up in his own swirling thoughts to pick out anything odd about the wayward princesses's behavior. 

He broke eye contact again and looked down to the tea cups. Both were only lightly sipped out of, but Faun wasn't going to bring it up. His flush face and racing heart screamed for him to leave. He picked the tea up and drank it obnoxiously fast before setting the empty cup back down. "Alright! I'll be on my way to.. get ready for later!" *He felt overwhelmingly awkward and out of place in the moment, scrutinizing every action he took and every word he said.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

"Yes! You do that," Afina looked down at her fresh clothes that her mother had sent. "I'll be here to, uh... change for later!" _Who changes in a parlor, Afina_ she thought, abruptly pushing the thought out of her mind. "I'll see you later then!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-26*

*Elfriede shuffled out rather robotically to head towards his room.*

[End Aside]

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

Characters: Elfriede and Afina
```

“How about a rematch after your crushing defeat at the outpost?” Afina suggested with a coy smile. She didn’t have her tomes on her person at the moment, but she was due for swordsmanship practice anyways. And surely Elfriede could use the self-confidence boost. “Unless you would like to concede defeat at the hands of a _princess_?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-27*

Elfriede smirked back "But, surely you are remembering incorrectly Fina! But I have no problem helping you remember!" He chided back at her. 

He wore a training gee that they had readily available that allowed for freedom of movement and was emblazened with the house of Faun symbol on the backs. He had San take one to Afina earlier to use if she liked. 

Faun grasped his training sword from the rack. It was a bit different than a rapier. It was more of a straight sword shape meant more for.slashing motions and not so much for thrusting. Although not metal, it actually beared *more* weight then his sword, as his blade was a slender thing.

"But Lyallel knows who will win this spar." Elfriede's false bravado was to lighten the mood a bit for himself as he still felt a bit uneasy from earlier. Also to cover up the awkward air they left upon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

“Of course it will be me,” Afina said, readying herself. “Even with the handicap of no magic, I’m sure the pupil can outperform the teacher.”

Afina had to admit that she was fond of the combat attire that Elfriede had supplied her with. Though not traditional princess garb, it was lightweight and comfortable, which would give the princess maximum range of motion in combat. She could feel the cold stone floor beneath her bare feet. Normally she wore, at the least, slippers when moving about the house; it was strangely invigorating to feel the chill of a cold floor for once. 

Shifting the training sword from hand to hand, testing out the weight, Afina felt much more relaxed. There was no chance of fumbling for words when all she had to do was fight. After all, training was like studying for the body as opposed to the mind. After so long spent at the tower, it was only natural that the princess would struggle with intimacy among friends, but Afina still agonized over her awkward demeanor. She recalled the sociable nature of her father, as he stood tall and proud over his council. _No, I can’t be thinking of family at a time like this_, she thought, shaking the reverie from her mind.

“Do not hold back,” she instructed, taking a defensive stance. “Though, as instructor, criticism is very much welcome.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-27*

Elfriede felt the pain in his abdomen was still there a bit but fast dwindling. He was excited to get back on his feet and train some more. In fact most medical mages recommended movement so the wounds didn't heal stiffly.

Faun looked her in the eyes, nodded and raised his sword at the ready and and began to circle a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

Afina pivoted to keep herself facing Elfriede as he circled, hand gripping the training sword tightly. _Too tightly_, Afina realized, adjusting her hold accordingly. She remembered her training sessions spent with Elfriede; She had made many mistakes at first, but learned quickly. A faint smile tugged at the corner of her mouth. She had to say that such sessions were some of the highlights of her trip. 

Full of energy, Afina decided to lunge forward first, aiming to hit Elfriede where he _hadn't_ just been stabbed.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-27*

Elfriede backstepped the last moment and Afinas swing hit air, although it was **very** close to clipping him. He smirked, clearly impressed. At the speed of her movements, she had greatly improved since their journey started. 

Seeing her skill put an excited sparkle in his eye as he pivoted his ankles to a stronger stance and swung down at an angle toward her left upper arm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

Afina was dismayed that she was unable to land a hit on Elfriede with her first try, but not exactly surprised. He _had_ been swordfighting since a child, after all. She had only started within the last couple weeks. Even still, the princess was confident that with enough speed and quick thinking, a victory was possible. 

As Elfriede swung downwards, Afina quickly raised her own sword to block. There was a sharp clap as the practice swords hit each other, and Afina quickly jumped back to create more space between Elfriede and herself. "Impressed?" she asked with a cocked eyebrow.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-27*

The swords clapped together with decent force, it made him a bit proud that she blocked his quick swing. He eyed her with a tilt of his head and a smile. "Perhaps a little, I guess I had better up the tempo." 

He readied himself and drove his sword forward in a series of three slashes and a single stab searching for an opening.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

Afina's brows furrowed with concentration. Elfriede's tactic in battle was to use his speed and agility to land quick, successive hits. Which meant she would have to have even faster blocks, or get out of range altogether. Afina shuffled backwards, unsteadily holding out her sword in front of her. She was way too off balance, and Elfriede would most definitely capitalize on that. 

The princess gripped the sword with both hands, and tiled it to catch Elfriede's own. She pressed her weight into the sword, hoping to disarm Elfriede, or at least upset his balance.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-28*

Fauns sword swing out wide as she landed a solid deflection, he nimbly stepped backward again to attempt to reset the situation. 

"Not bad!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

Already leaning into the block and pushing the advantage, Afina pressed forward, hoping to bring her sword up to hit Elfriede across the chest. It was a risky move, but possibly one that the knight wouldn’t see coming. 

“I learned from the best,” she said with a smile.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-28*

He saw the second swing coming as she pressed the attack. He smirked and rolled on the ground backwards, but something was wrong. He felt sluggish, had those few days not training really hurt his ability that much?! Faun stumbled and landed hard on his rear, barely missing the base of his tail,still somehow managing to bring the sword up to clap against hers. His eyes went wide a bit, it's like his body couldn't keep up with his mind.

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

Quietly the door to the training room opens. Aria Faun slips in and closes the door without a word nor a sound. She crosses her arms and leans against the wall next to the door, watching with narrowed eyes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

Afina heard the distinct clap of the training swords hitting each other, but was thoroughly confused . Had Elfriede… really landed on his rear? Was fighting from the floor a tactic that she just hadn’t learned yet. _His injuries must be impeding his ability to fight_, she thought, watching his eyes go wide. 

“Are you alright?” she asked, sword still poised to counter Elfriede’s.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-28*

"Yes.. I'm quite alright.." he said rather disappointedly. "There's no reason to stop because of my mistake, let us continue!"
 He shoved her sword upwards and rolled backwards into a back handspring to land gently on his feet. He couldn't believe he made such a rookie mistake.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

"Hm, we shall," Afina said, dashing forward as Elfriede got back to his feet. For once, she had an advantage over him; He had just recovered from an injury, making his reflexes slower than usual. Afina swung two slashes at the knight, and aimed to jab at his shoulder. With luck, the slashes would throw him just enough off balance to manage to land a hit.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-30*

The first blow cam down as he back pedaled and hit air. He could feel how near he was to the wall, the last thing he needed was to be cornered. Afina came in again with a similar swing. He dove into a roll forward to her right in an effort to dodge the swing. He tumbled and steadied himself in a crouch simultaneously swinging to catch her off gaurd and back pedal herself. To his surprise the sword struck the back of her legs, for she made no effort to evade. In that same moment she followed through with the swing and clipped his upper back with the tail end of her swing. Both would have been serious injuries in *true* martial combat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

Afina took a step back. “Hm, I hit your back, surely that’s the more fatal of the two hits, no?” she asked, now holding her training sword in both hands like a baton. Her eyes were wide, but not entirely innocent, as if she almost dared Elfriede to admit that she had gotten the better hit in. ““Though it would seem that evasion is a skill that I have yet to develop…” the princess added, pursing her lips as she glanced down at the back of her legs. 

“Nonetheless… a blow to the back is quite incapacitating,” she beamed.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-30*

Elfriede (now sitting on the floor where he was) crossed his arms. "Well technically it was at the follow through of your swing, so there wouldnt have been as much power behind it." He said only semi serious. "If i was wearing armour it might not have even went through!" He chuckled a bit as he argued his point when the corner of his eye caught movement by the doorway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

“And your swing would not have even chaffed my tough boots,” she said firmly, though still smiling. “They aren’t just for fashion, you know.” Afina noticed as Elfriede’s gaze became distant, and she followed his line of sight. There by the door stood Aria Faun, who had seemingly slipped into the training room unnoticed. Afina offered a hand to help pull Elfriede back to his feet. 

Afina could feel Elfriede’s uneasiness as she grasped his hand to help him up. _Had he gotten more pale?_ she wondered. Afina hoped she could diffuse such a situation relatively quickly. “Good afternoon Lady Faun, we were training before returning to our journey tomorrow morning. Elfriede has been quite helpful throughout much of the learning process; I’m glad to see that he’s recovered.”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-04-30*

He gazed at his mother and wondered what she was thinking. Was she only watching or did she have some intention? *...Aria Faun always had an intention* Maybe to see how his recovery was effecting his abilities? *...Or maybe even...* His gaze turned up to Afina. *Was she watching for someone... else's skills*? 

"Good afternoon mother."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-19*

[END ASIDE]

After two days of travel, Elfriede and Afina decided to make camp for the night in a nearby forest. After a thorough sweep of the area, the knight deemed the location to be safe, and sat down to unpack his bedroll. Afina did much the same, shifting through her pack, and eventually resorting to dumping most of her bag's contents on the ground. 

Afina frowned. "It seems that my bedroll was not packed along with the rest of my articles when we departed your house." The princess looked defeated as she eyed the books and clothes that laid strewn across the ground. She spied a particular book laying open on the ground, and quickly began to pick them up and stack them. Afina glared at the ground. "I suspect that perhaps the handmaid may be responsible. She's quick lucky that my parents have sent me my warmer set of clothes."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-19*

As Elfriede inspected thier to-be campsite,removing small rocks and creating a small fire pit, he heard Afina rooting through her bag followed by the sounds of frustratingly dumping the contents out. Elfriede turned around a raised a concerned eyebrow. As she mumured her frustrations Elfriede took notice that she didn't have her bedroll. 

*"...San"* he quietly said under his breath. "Ah.. sorry about that Fina.., you may use mine instead.   I have slept on the ground before, I'm sure I'll be okay." He shivered a bit as the sun began to set, tonight was the coldest yet, it had rained the night before which brought an intense chill over the fall air. It was to be a restless night.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-19*

Afina laughed awkwardly. "Ah, no, that wouldn't do. Then _you_ would be the one freezing. I doubt you'd be very effective as a protector with frostbite." The princess gestured towards Elfriede's bed roll. "We... can share, don't you think?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-20*

Elfriede went silent as he rummaged through his supplies. He finally turned around producing rations and his bedroll which he spread out. He then began gathering sticks to use as kindling for the fire not making eye contact. 
After a few moments of still silence (as most of the summer bugs and animals were already hibernating) Elfriede crouched next to where she was sitting with her supplies. ".. Alright,but just this once.."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-20*

Afina felt conflicted. On one hand, this was likely an egregious blow to Elfriede's honor as a knight. It wasn't typical for escorts to have to _share bedrolls_ with their charges. But on the other... Afina had to admit that the idea was almost exciting. The princess had never spent overnights with friends as a child; an experience then was better late than never. _It proves to be another opportunity to get closer to Elfriede_, Afina thought, before quickly admonishing herself. _Stop being ridiculous; all rationality would indicate that avoiding such frivolous temptations should be a Callorian princess' priority._

"Yes of course, I would like to avoid making a habit of such circumstances. Trisp should have plenty of inns anyways." Afina took her shoes off and stuck her legs into the bed roll. The crisp air of an autumn night brushed against her cheeks and she pulled the hood of her tunic up. "You know, my grandfather would be quite surprised to see a Callorian and Eraian sharing the same space. Interesting, in a way."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-20*

After starting the fire, Faun sat closer to her and wriggled out of his boots and stretched his toes. A wave of stress hung over him as he realized that he had to be careful not to expose his heritage. He'd have to sleep facing her, despite keeping warm tonight it still would be a long night. *I can't back out now, she might suspect something.. I'll just have to be very careful..* 

"Yes, given our country's opinions of each other in years past I am sure our ancestors would be quite shocked. Mixing of cultures is an interesting thing to some, but to some others.." Elfriede opened a container and produced some dried meat for them both to eat. "I would think with the ever-seeking-knowledge nature of Callora that they would encourage such things as relationships with people from other countries." He took a large bite of his food.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-20*

Afina took a piece of dried meat, with a dainty nature that only a princess would use for such food. She seemed to analyze it for a moment before taking a bite. "Prejudice is ignorance to Laerans, of course we would want to expand our horizons. It just seems that some people draw the line in different places. For my grandfather, though he promoted cooperate among Callorians, he seemed to believe that Eraians were so backwards that their culture was not worth knowing." 

A coy smile spread across the princess' face. "And while he was correct, Eraians are quite 'backwards', that doesn't mean that we can't learn from each other." 

"Other people seem to have no limits to the knowledge they pursue. My father--." Afina's face falls as she remembers the letters. "My father is a staunch follower of the open arms and open minds doctrine towards laguz, for instance. It's why Laeran institutions accept so many laguz pupils. It seems every generation of Tyndall has been the fierce champion of some cause or another."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-20*

For a moment Faun was lost in his heritage, wondering if perhaps if he was born a Laeran. He would have lived as a Laguz. The sheer thought made him feel dirty, like that was a version of himself that was not "correct", not truly him. In a way it wasn't him, he had grown up as a Faun after all. He wasn't defined by his Laguz traits, but himself and his family. ...Yet at the same tmie he couldnt help but wonder, even if it made his stomach churn.

"I suppose that's admirable. I certainly find comfort in Eraian ways, although I try to keep an open mind other customs are a bit... outlandish? Makes me wonder how different i'd be if I was born elsewhere. But then would I really be *Elfriede Faun, Knight Leiutenant of the Eraian Gaurd?*" He chuckled a bit to lighten the air. He put away the container of food and took off his duelist plate that wrapped tightly around his chest and set it near his belongings. He sat positioned next to Afina and slid his legs into the bedroll, the inviting bedroll already warmed by her body heat. The sleeping accomodation just large enough to fit both of them with a little room to spare.

He could already see his and her breathe by the light of the fire. "Tis a cold early fall..." He said softly, he wondered if she thought much the same as him. Elfreide tried to not pay attention to his nervousness in his abdomen nor his barely noticable unsteady breathing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-20*

"I suppose you would be quite different," Afina said, half thinking out loud. "A scary thought, really, to not be yourself. Don't you think?" 

As Elfriede settled into the bedroll, Afina couldn't help but notice the isolation of their surroundings. The cool night, the bright stars in a dark sky, the cover of the trees. It was as if the two of them belonged to a different world entirely. Elfriede seemed to notice as much as well.

"Yes, it is quite cold," Afina nodded, deciding that the best remedy would be to wiggle down into the bedroll more. Despite the adverse weather, however, Afina could not help but feel warm and comfortable between Elfriede and the bedroll. "I used to love fall..." she said absent-mindedly, gazing up at the sky. "But fall means that winter is close behind. And everything becomes so cold and dead. I find it quite depressing." She shrugs, the campfire illuminating a slight smirk. "I _was_ born in the spring, however, so I may be biased."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-21*

"I know it means winter is well on it's way, but fall has so many beauties that make it well worth it I think." Faun lowers himself a bit into the bedroll gently resting his head on it facing her. 

"The smells and the slight chill. The dimness of the colors due to the ever present clouds in the sky. But at the same time all the new hues of the wilting plants." 
He shivers a bit, "Tonight however, feels a bit more like winter than fall." He chuckles a bit. "To our dismay."

Faun quietly took notice of how fast the bedroll had gotten warm with the accompaniment of two people. It was something he had no experience with, he found it soothing and helping to calm his nerves a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Afina nodded absentmindedly, truly noticing how close Elfriede and her were in the bedroll. Mere inches from each other, Afina could see every detail in his amber eyes. The princess felt her chest tighten as she became aware of how nervous she felt, compounding her inability to think properly.  Grasping at a new conversation topic to distract herself, the Callorian suddenly remembered the question that Aria Faun had asked her.

"Elfriede, you know, your mother asked me a particularly odd question while I was training the other day. I'm wondering what you might think of it." 

Thoughts of Laera and her duty and her family were far away in Afina's mind as she lay there with Elfriede, the two of them alone in the dim light of the fire. The knight had a dichotomic way of both making her nervous and calming her down. Afina reached out for Elfriede's hand underneath the bedroll as she spoke, interlacing her fingers with his. 

"What do you think of people's differences? Can they be overcome, or will they always be a barrier between people?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-21*

Elfriede gasped lightly when she pressed her hand into his. He paused briefly in astonishment, then closed his fingers around her hand. He breathed out as he had realized he had been holding his breath. 

*My heart is racing.* He could no longer ignore the subtleties in their proximity. It was then realized they had be lying there staring for almost a full minute and he had not answered her. 

“Differences should add to a relationship and not take away from it… in theory. Too many differences would not allow for common ground to establish a complex relationship with someone.” He realized his explanation sounded more definition then to feelings, but he was having trouble concentrating. He even missed a key detail, who had asked the question. His mind jumped to his an Afina’s differences. Faun thought they truly had a lot of common ground, but there were a few things…

He gently and unintentionally tightened his hold on her hand. “What do you think on it Fina?”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Afina waited for a moment, tense, until she finally felt Elfriede's fingers close around her own hand. With one motion, the princess was immediately both relaxed and exhilarated. A small smile played across Afina's face, before she realized that she had been staring _much_ too long, and awkwardly looked away. 

Her gaze returned to the knight as he spoke, and Afina couldn't help but overanalyze every word. _Common ground, do Elfriede and I have enough common ground? Where do we differ? How badly do we differ?_ She felt the gentle squeeze of Elfriede's hand in hers and realized that he had asked her opinion on the matter. 

"I think we can learn from each other by being different. Our differences, just like our similarities, make us who we are." Afina hesitated, unsure if her explanation was sufficient, and the lingering nervousness giving the princess a tendency to ramble. "Naturally you and I would be in accordance if we were both knights from Eraia. But it's because we are different that I now have knowledge of Eraia and you of Laera. It's harmonious, in a way. We are both better individuals because we can learn from our differences." 

_Does that mean that Elfriede sees collaboration... or rather. A relationship. Is possible between Eraians and Callorians? We aren't like our grandparents. For a princess and a knight, of countries at a diplomatic stalemate, we surely seem to be disregarding national loyalties over personal ones_, Afina thought. 

"Can I tell you a secret?" she asked.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-21*

“*Can I tell you a secret.*” Afina’s words made him unintentionally hold his breath yet again. The two being so close, he lightly felt her warm breath as she spoke in stark contrast the the chill air on his face. Elfriede broke his gaze from her. He naively wished to embrace her and let this moment go on forever. 

*I never want to make it to Trisp...* he foolishly and selfishly thought to himself. They were to make Trisp within the week.

“Of course.”, he said before giving it a thought, for he had enough secrets of his own.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

"I don't think I want to be Queen of Laera," Afina said, a firm sense of confident finality in her voice. Seeing Elfriede's surprised expression, the princess elaborated. "It's not that I want to avoid the responsibilities of a queen. But, rather. I think that what I really want is to protect my people, and to make my family proud. And becoming queen is the easiest way to achieve both." 

Afina's gaze softened as she felt the fatigue of the day's travel seeping in. Between the warmth of the bedroll, Elfriede's closeness, and the energy spent walking along less-than-paved roads, the princess had not realized how exhausted that she had been. "I think my time spent traveling has complicated those goals, though. My sympathies for others have extended beyond Laera's borders for sure. You yourself have offered the highest form of support and genuine friendship that I've ever known. And I don't know how well being Queen may benefit me in helping the citizens of other nations and friends anymore." 

The princess yawned. "I suppose we'll have to see how that works out. There's still Trisp to reach, after all."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-21*

Elfriede nodded in approval. In that moment he wanted to tell her everything. Everything about his heritage and his family… but he couldn't bring himself to say anything. He watched as the elegant Laeran princess yawned and blinked away the glossiness over her eyes. Her eyes were clearly weighty from the weariness instilled by the day of travelling. The knight-lieutenant began to realize that he felt much the same. 

Faun smiled at her, taking notice for seemingly the first time of her long blonde hair. *Truly fitting for her.* “That’s noble of you. You need not keep that a secret. Many-a-descendant I’m sure did not want the throne. But I’m sure you will be a good leader.” Faun struggled over his internal warring with his emotions. He yearned to tell her so badly, but it just wasn't the time. 

Exhaustion began to overtake him. As his eyes slowly began to close... Faun decided that he would tell her when they reach Trisp. He prayed she’d accept the part of him... that he truly wished… at times... *did not exist.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

[END ASIDE]

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-23*

Fauns eyes slowly opened to ambient sounds of nature in the fall. Small animals scurrying through freshly fallen leaves and the sounds of the remaining few birds. The sunrise was bright and piercing unlike the previous day. *Today is going to be a warm day* ran through Elfriede's mind in his morning haze… when he realized that his bedroll was oddly warm for the fall.

He attempted to move to sit up when he realized his legs were intertwined with another. Faun opened one eye to the top of his companion's head; her face near to his chest as her shoulders rose and fell slowly from her breaths. Almost gasping aloud as both his eyes opened wide, his right arm pinned under the princess’s head. 

He didn't know what to do, or what he was going to say when she awoke; he couldn't slip off and avoid the whole interaction. His face feeling warm and flushed as he remembered the night before. Soon enough the princess began to stir.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

Afina’s eyelids fluttered as she woke up, the chirping of birds and rustle of the wind through the trees signaling the princess that it was time to start the day. Half-asleep, Afina tried to shift in her bedroll, before realizing that she was firmly held in place by… _someone!?_ The princess woke with a start, confused as to where she was and more importantly _who_ she was with. She relaxed at the sight of a familiar purple and white outfit. _I remember now_, she thought. _Elfriede and I shared a bedroll to sleep last night. But this is much closer than we were last night… right?_ 

Afina looked up to see if Elfriede was still asleep, only to be eye to eye with the knight. The princess fumbled for words. “I… uh. Good morning. Elfriede. How did you sleep?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-23*

He felt Afina stiffen a bit almost in a slight panic. She looked up at him and visibly relaxed, which helped him feel a bit more relaxed as well. 

Faun smiled, “The best I've had in a while.” The knight shifted a bit and realized just how interlocked their legs were, how close they were… 

He knew he wouldn't be able to see her in the same light as when he first arrived in Theonovane. There was something new, the new thoughts and emotions swirling about in him made him anxious. 

“I-I’m sorry Fina, .. as a knight and you current protector I shouldn't let…” his voice trailed off as he stared at her eyes. He wasn't sure what to say or do to convey his feelings. He felt like a selfish child.

Faun moved forward and embraced her tightly with little context for a few moments, then propped himself up to a sitting position.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

Elfriede, similarly, seemed to be at a loss for what to say. For the first time, Afina considered that perhaps she wasn’t the _only_ one assessing where their “friendship” lay. _It’s possible after all this time, Elfriede was in a similar position as myself_, she thought, analyzing his face. The knight was calm, relaxed, and looked the most content as she had seen him look in all their travels. His demeanor suddenly shifted to be more defensive, as he stuttered out an apology. 

Afina wanted to assure him that his status as knight was not the only thing that defined him in her eyes. After travelling for nearly three weeks together, unseparated, it would only be natural that they become at least friends. She wanted to tell him that their relationship was likely no longer defined by their roles as protector and charge, but to think so and say so were two entirely different actions. Not to mention, if the princess was wrong in her assumptions…

Afina suddenly found herself in a tight embrace, and all her thoughts fell away. In that moment, all that existed was Elfriede’s comforting hold on her. Though no words were exchanged between the two, Afina understood what he was trying to convey. Platonic or not, it was obvious that they cared for each other. The comforting talks, training together, defending each other’s backs in the face of absolute danger. It was a deep connection that the Laeran had not forged with any other individual. Afina buried her face in Elfriede’s chest, closing her eyes to lose herself in their embrace. She wished they could forgo Trisp to stay like this, but such an expectation was unrealistic. Laera would always need her, and she could not forget her country to run off with some _knight_. Afina had never taken herself for cliches, and yet, here she was. _A princess seemingly chasing after a knight_, she thought.

Elfriede propped himself up to a sitting position, and Afina followed suit, sitting with her legs crossed on top of the bedroll. No matter what, the two of them would have to discuss the events of last night. Was this their new “norm”, to hold hands and sleep next to each other? Such actions were typically reserved for romantic partners, at least in Laera. Perhaps Eraians, with their staunch observances of cleanliness (which made for many more occasions for nudity) and their ideals of military kinship, were more likely to take such exchanges as platonic. 

“Thank you, Elfriede, but you have no need to apologize. Though we have humble beginnings as simply escort and charge, I’m proud to call you a devout friend now. No need to relegate our relationship to such strict, formal titles,” she smiled, hoping to reassure him. Even still, what he had begun to say before tugged at her mind. _I shouldn't let…_ he had said. _Let what, exactly?_ she thought. 

Furthermore, how was she supposed to ask if this was their standard behavior now? It was an awkward question, and would make it seem like she placed expectations on Elfriede either way. Afina _wanted_ it to be the standard now, as she would only want to continue being close to the knight. But perhaps such expectations were wrong. “Is this, however, the new standard for us now?” she asked, with a tightness that gave away how awkward she felt. _Good job Afina, now he’s either offended or repulsed_, she thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-23*

Afina's words put part of him at ease. However, he still had his new emotions to entertain. *"Is this, however, the new standard for us now?*  She said it.. oddly to him. So straight forward. He had trouble understanding what she was trying to convey. *Confusion? Did she feel awkward?* Elfriede pondered it for a bit and got quiet. The knight-leiutenant was suddenly concious of all of his actions towards her, but...  didnt want to pass up the oportunity to spend more time close to her either. 

After a few moments he broke eye contact and looked down as if embarrased. "I'm sorry... I think... I want to be selfish..." He paused a moment trying to get the words out. "I would like to until we reach Trisp." He felt a tightness in his chest and his stomach.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

Elfriede looked away. "I would like to until we reach Trisp". Afina blinked in surprise, wholly expecting the knight to want to maintain his personal space. Afina's own breath was caught in her chest, shocked to have received the exact answer that she had been searching for. "As would I," she said softly. "Once we reach Trisp we can once again evaluate to see if this is still such the best course of action. With the press ever vigilant and such the tension between Eraia and Callora as it is." 

She patted his hand reassuringly. "We can talk about it the night we arrive in the monastery. Yes?" _And then perhaps... maybe it will be safe to tell him how I truly feel_, she thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-05-24*

"Yes... if its the best course.. at Trisp." He said begrudgingly. Elfriede slowly stood feeling embarrassed and awkward for asking such a thing. He held out a hand to help the princess up. 
"Allow me to clean up our camp and prepare our breakfast." He said, unsure how to proceed with the day. He felt as if he'll be rather distracted today.

[End Asidaru Doki 💗 ]

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

```
Characters: Aldus, Desii
The Violet Light's Rest
```

Aldus approaches Desii's door with hesitation. *I hope she's not already sleeping, I hope I don't bother her too much, she probably needs to rest after this strange night, ancestors... maybe I should do this in the morning? NO It's gotta be now, I'm already all the way here, just do it Aldus* he places two slow knocks on the dark wooden door, trying  not to startle the young woman. "Desii?" he calls in a  gentle voice "It's Aldus"

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

Desii looks up from Zaimar's tome at the knock on the door. She had been sitting on the bed, reading the tome intently curled up in her white nightgown. Her eyebrows quirked, *Why would Aldus need to visit?*. She pondered this as she slowly swung her feet off the bed, feet sliding into her warm boots. She leaves the tome on the bed and heads for the door, opening it. 

"Good evening Aldus. To what do I owe the pleasure?" she says lightly, the multiple candles lighting the room filling the hall with a warm light.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

"Good evening to you too, I hope I'm not disturbing you too much?" he says noting the warm glow and discarded book. "I was hoping we could discuss a little bit more about my reason for being in Eraia, as well as yours? This place has me quite uncomfortable" he admits rubbing the back of his neck nervously.

Desii blinks twice at the stiffly speaking Aldus. He really must be uncomfortable being in Eraia.

"Sure." she say with a quiet smile. "We can talk about your things first, mine is pretty straight forward. What's bothering you?" she says as she turns on her heel, opening the door the rest of the way and heading for the bed. She sits on the side of the bed, hands in lap after she motions for Aldus to take the desk chair.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

Aldus takes a seat "Well, as you know, I'm here in Trisp for the Crysalin flower. I believe you said it grows out on the coast here? You also said you had interest in studying if i recall, and I doubt I would be able to find it on my own. I was hoping you'd be willing to go with me?"

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

"I wouldn't say study, per-say..." Desii says, brushing a lock of hair behind her ear. "It's a tad embarrassing, but I heard about Crysalin in a romance novel once. There's a beautiful cliffside in the story that is lined with Crysalin flowers. The flowers gleam like dew drops in the sun, shining against the rock until they wilt away. When they do, they become water and drop into sea below, as do their seeds. The seeds are washed into the cliff face during storms, starting the cycle all over again." she says. 

"It was a beautiful back drop for Guilan to make his propo...sal..." Desii trails off. "I think I can skip the details of the novel itself. Might not really be relevant here." she says with a sheepish smile, rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

Aldus is caught off guard by Desii's sudden enthusiasm . He thought she was after the flower for some scholarly purpose, since she seemed very interested in learning. Her sudden outburst is surprisingly endearing though. He finds himself smiling at her wistfully at her passion. "That sounds like a lovely story." He's careful not to laugh for fear of her taking it as criticism when in reality he is simply amused. "Well, whatever your reason is, I was hoping to have company for the search, I suspect Eliran will be off on his own way soon, and Nokri also, once she finds some other poor soul to attach herself too for protection" then he mumbles slightly under his breath: "poor bastard."

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

"Well..." Desii says, looking down at her knees as she idly flattens out her gown. "I don't really mind accompanying you. I haven't had too much of a plan, though you may have figured it out already." she chuckles awkwardly. "I'd like to learn some light magic while I'm here, but it's a passing interest. I'm not sure what to do with myself, really. I left so quickly, I just knew I wanted to see beyond Hylley... Probably a bad reason to go traveling, right?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

*Better than being virtually outcasted* He thinks to himself fatalistically. "I believe you had more than enough reason to leave from what you've told me" He doesn't explore further, not wanting to bring up unwanted thoughts.  "I didn't have much a plan either when I left home either, although you've managed to change that for me, thank you." He says honestly.

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

"eh?" Desii says, looking up at the wolf laguz. His emerald eyes seem to glimmer in the candle light as he thanks her. "I don't think I really did anything, honestly!" she says, waving her hands in front of her in denial. "I'm not even sure what happened, honestly. Ever since I met you three it's been a blur..." She continues, eyes leaving Aldus's own. Desii hesitates for a moment.

"You said 'poor soul' before, when talking about Nokri... You two seem to know each other more than Eliran, that's just an... odd turn of phrase to use." Desii says, losing track of what she wanted to ask as she speaks.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

"Don't discredit yourself now, I had been wandering somewhat aimlessly before you." He leans back in his chair, propping up his left ankle on his right knee and folding his arms over his chest. He's beginning to feel a bit more comfortable now. 

He chuckles softly "You heard that, huh? Yea well, the way Nokri and I met was... strange to say the least, I can't say I know her very well. She is extremely closed off from others, and she's been very... cold? to me at least, despite defending her for the past few months... The only time she's shown me anything to the contrary was in that bandit hideout, and only for a moment.  Seems to like all these big shot nobles that we dined with tonight though. "

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

Desii leaned back herself, momentarily forgetting there was nothing behind her. Adjusting to a less grandose lean back, she stares upward at the ceiling. Desii flips through her memories of the smaller girl, both her interactions with Aldus and everyone else in her mind. 

"I'd have suspected that was her approach to everyone, honestly... Maybe you know her better than everyone else, because you notice those differences?" She says, flipping her forward and tilting it slightly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

"Perhaps... I suspect it all has to do with money at status to her, she knows I have humble finances and there's nothing to gain from me, therefore I'm useless to her... Except when I save her life it would seem, but I digress"

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

"Why would she continue to travel with you then? Is there not something more to it?" Desii asks. "I suppose it could just have happened, after all, I just picked up and joined the three of you." she adds with a shrug.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

"She claimed she was trying to help me find a cure for my inability to transform, whether that was the truth or simple a way to get a free body guard I don't know. Or maybe she was hoping we'd find the cure and she could get rich of f of it, since everything seems to lead back to money with her"  Aldus lets out a deep sigh, then directs the subject away from the small blonde woman "But enough about that, with all these loaded pockets around I suspect she'll be leaving my side soon enough. Is there any word of Enera?"

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

Desii frowns as Aldus laments Nokri's personality. Nokri is... well, not endearing for sure but Desii never pegged the small girl for manipulative. Her common sense points out that Desii doesn't have a great track record for identifying manipulative people. Desii chooses to ignore that, Nokri had to be younger than her. Zaimar was who he was because... well, he was. Desii wasn't to about to assume all people were like him. 

"I didn't make any effort after dinner, it was so late I assumed the monastery was closed. I can't imagine it'd be so easy to find her, but it'd certainly be something if it was!" Desii says, happy to change gear out of her thoughts. "My plan is go in the morning and find her there. Can't be too hard, can it?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

"You met the Princess at the monastery, yes? Eliran seems to know her quite well... Can't imagine what she's doing in Eraia though... Maybe she knows something? or more likely someone she knows, knows something. "

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

"We may find out, if Eliran and her continue to spend time together. The Princess seems nice,  I'd like it if we could." Desii says. "Ah, to bring it back around, the monastery is the first building to be built in Trisp and there's a lot of knowledge there. It may have the location of the Crysalin written down somewhere." 

"We can't spend forever walking down the beaches of Eraia's shores, after all." She says with a smile and light giggle. "Will you accompany me there in the morning?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

"Sounds like a plan to me, perhaps we can kill two birds with one stone? That would be lucky indeed. I believe it had gotten quite late while we've been chatting." Aldus rises from his chair near the desk and turns toward the door. "I've enjoyed talking to you Desii. I will let you return to your studies, or your novels if you prefer." Referencing her earlier excitment.

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

Desii laughs loud and clearly. "Oh no, I didn't bring any of those with me. Good night Aldus, I'll see you in the morning." she says, waving to the Laguz as he closes the door behind him.

`[end aside]`

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-23*

```Characters: Aldus, Eliran
The Violet Light's Rest
```

Aldus head's back to his own room after leaving Desii. just then he notices Eliran coming up the stairs. Aldus feels a slight sense of betrayal rise up within him as they get closer to each other, Aldus calls out to him. "Eliran, or should I say Eliran Cantaret, of the Cantaret Household and Trading Company" the sarcasm in his voice is obvious.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-23*

Eliran looked up to the laguz, "yes..?" he said mildly confused at the sarcastic comment.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-23*

"When exactly were you going to tell me about this title of yours? Assume we never met up with this princess and the knight."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-23*

"About my what?" He asked tone shifting from confused more to a slightly unsettled sound as he reached the top of the stairs and stood next to Aldus. "I told you my name when we met."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-23*

"yes, but you failed to inform me of your trading company affiliation, i thought you too be a run of the mill bard, not some heir to a trading company"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-23*

Eliran continued to the door of their room, unlocking it. "Actually my brother is heir. Much more into the whole business shtick." he said coming off somewhat dismissive as he opened the door and looked to Aldus, holding it for the Laguz, "What difference does it make?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-23*

Aldus stops in front of Elrian as he holds the door open for him. "The difference it makes is we've been traveling together for weeks and you never mentioned this once, then you out right announce it as if it was common fact, I've already got one companian who refuses to tell me anything about herself, I don't need another."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-23*

"Your comparing me to Nokri?" Eliran said incredulously, and then shook his head as he entered the room, slipping around Aldus and leaving the door to him. "I didn't tell you because it doesn't matter. I am who I am, not some name for you to ogle." He added as he prepared his bed, almost refusing to look at Aldus by preoccupying himself with other matters.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-23*

"No I... Didn't... I... Ugh look I don't want to fight. I was just caught off guard. This place has me very... Uptight? I was just surprised is all. I'm sorry, you're right, you are who you are."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-24*

"Its fine." Eliran said as he finished laying out his things, promptly flopping onto his bed. It was quiet for a moment as the bard looked at the ceiling. "was it that shocking though?" Eliran asked absentmindedly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

"I suppose we just don't know each other that well yet, you don't seem the merchant type exactly."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-26*

"I try and avoid it." Eliran admitted, "nothing good comes from being a famously wealthy person on the road"

Eliran continued to stare at the ceiling, "we can talk more about it tomorrow, night Aldus." He said turning over then slowly falling asleep.

```End Aside```

```Lovation: Trisp Bathhouse
Characters: Elfriede, Eliran```

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-26*

Faun realized that he had been relaxing for some time and abruptly sat up straight. He couldn't laze around too much or he'd begin to feel a bit lazy. He submerged his hair in the water and scrubbed at it with a scented bar of a mixture of animal milk and herbs. He pushed his hair back and slowly did the same over his whole body. As he got to his face he dunked his head in the water and looked up wiping his eyes clear. As his vision went from blurry to clear he made out someone familiar among and few people in the pool. The man with green curls and the instrument. 

Elfriede immediately felt a mixture of jealous and awkward. Feelings of which he still didnt quite understand. He briefly decided to remain quiet, as he didnt want to engage in the awkward conversation about the situation with the man's friends again. Elfriede found himself deep in thought again about the man's origins and how he knew the princess. Afina had told him a little the night before, but this man clearly knew a lot about her. Had... they had a previous relationship? Perhaps he was courting her? 

Just as Elfriede reasoned to leave the bath, Eliran's teal eyes slide from deep in thought to directly in contact with his Amber orbs. Faun froze and gripped the towel around his waist tightly. *Maybe he wont recognize me.*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-26*

Eliran, currently towelless as he was lower half was submerged, looked at what seemed to be a spooked man directly in the eye. He then slowly looked the man up and down, _quite the specimen, at least Afina has good taste_ Eliran thought as he recognized the knight. The two shared eye contact for an awkward amount of time before Eliran broke the silence, "hello sir faun, nice day for a bath don't you think?" _I had planned on talking to him... I guess this works_ Eliran thought, trying to keep some sense of decorum in the situation

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-26*

Elfriede shifted uncomfortablely looking down and eyed the new scar across his abdominal muscles, pretending not to notice the man.. til he spoke. *Hello Sir Faun.. nice day for a bath don't you think?*

"A-ah yes it really is ..." Faun frantically scrambling through his memory to not seem rude. "Eliran was it?" The man's voice was smooth and Faun felt a bit more at ease. 

However against Faun's sound mind.., the way this man spoke.. he felt as if he was no match for him, and Afina would fall for him at any moment. Jealousy lightly boiled inside of him, which he swiftly forced down, trying to stay reasonable. He shouldn't feel this way...

"What have you been up to? And furthermore, are you and your folk hanging around Trisp a while? I'm sure the princess would appreciate some faces she knows..." He sort of awkwardly said, idlely trying to make conversation so it didn't stray to the events yesterday.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-26*

Eliran looked at the Faun, the man was clearly uncomfortable, and sounded a bit rushed as he tried to build conversation. 
Giving a small laugh, Eliran motioned for Elfriede to sit near him, "calm down man, it's a bathhouse, no need to force pleasantries and speed through a chat." He said, hoping to get Elfriede to slow down. "I actually wanted to talk to you a bit."
--- 
Normally, Eliran wore mostly loose long sleeve clothing, as was appropriate for a bard of his sort. In the bathhouse, one could begin to see it wasn't all he was. As Elfriede got closer to the Bard, he could notice the mans more toned appearance, with a lean muscle definition. What was notable however were the surprising bulk of his arms and back, which had been groomed from years of training with bows, working towards a mastery of mobile archery using a specialized recurve bow.

It was an odd appearance for a man who was supposed to be a wealthy merchant's son and musician.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-26*

"ah." Faun winced a bit at his offer to move closer... but begrudingly raised himself up out of the water a bit to walk over closer to Eliran. He tightly gripped his towel of course as he stood the water dropping off of him into the pool as he made his way closer, sitting a couple feet to elirans left. 

"What is it you wanted to speak about?" He said in a more serious tone than he had intended. Faun still felt a bit uptight being so close to someone he had barely met... naked. Plus.. he feared what he was going to be asked by the Cantaret.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-27*

"Nothing to serious," Eliran leaned back against the edge of the pool, his right arm outstretched along the wall, the other down. "I heard your travels with Afina were tough." he mentioned idly

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-27*

Elfriede eyes shot to his as he mutter those words. *how much did she tell him?*  "Y-yes, unfortunetly several hard battles were fought on our way to Lyall, it being such high risk territory right now saw to that..." He paused for a moment to consider. "I'm assuming she told you some of the story, did you wish to know more indepth? ...or... was there something else you wished to discuss Ser Cantaret?" he said, his eyes narrowing slightly in curiousity.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-27*

For a brief moment Eliran's face contorted to a somewhat disgruntled look, like he had just smelled something displeasing, "Please call me Eliran, formal titles are bothersome." He shook his head, "She told me a bit, something about laguz bandits and pirates I think?" He shrugged, "You two must have become real good partners to survive all of that eh?'

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-27*

"Yes, indeed we've begun to work well togethor, although... we did have a bit of help from some other companions as well as Ransfords men during the Bandit fight... and the sailors during the pirates." he added with a slight chuckle.

Elfriede smiled, "But yes, we were begining to compliment eachother nicely. I had also begun to show her some basic military tactics as well as sword fighting skils on the side... In exchange she had taught me... well tried to teach me a bit of magic." 

*Among this talk of Afina, Faun began to picture her again, feeling nervous for the future converstaion they were to have soon.*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-27*

"Ha" eliran barked a small laugh, "Afina, a teacher? That'd be a sight to see" he shook his head, seeming quite amused with the idea"talented and learning oriented as she might be, that girl doesn't have the patience or humility to teach in her." 
Eliran paused for a moment, taking a second to collect himself, "so.. you two, just compliment each other well in a fight?" he asked looking at Elfriede with a raised eyebrow, "or did you find yourself 'complimenting' each other well off the battlefield as well?" His tone was curious, and casual, and if anything else slightly suggestive.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-27*

"I..." Elfriede paused at the straight forward curiosity. Of course sending him back into thought about the princess and the night before.  "...I'm beginning to think so." He said before thinking. 

Faun was curious as to this line of questioning. *Is he trying to size me up as competition?* Faun narrowed his eyes a bit again.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-27*

Eliran looked at the knight, he hadn't expected the man to actually answer him properly. He looked back at the pool, "well figure it out quickly, " Eliran was a bit concerned of the Knights hesitant answer, but he chalked it up to not being already close to Elfriede. "Theres only so much time you have before she goes back to Callora or Theanovene." He looked at the Faun with a slight grin, "plus its rude to keep a lady waiting."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-27*

Elfriede sat in silence a bit in reflection. He was right... Tonight for sure he'd speak to her... And tell her.. so they can move onward. 

Faun looked to Eliran and nodded sincerely and seriously.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-27*

Eliran looked at Elfriede, who very sincere and serious demeanor seemed a bit out of place in a bathhouse, "You Eraians are always so serious," he said shaking his head slightly amused "well as long as you understand it's all that matters " 
Eliran then began to stand up, getting ready to leave, "Oh and by the way," he started, turning around to face Elfriede, then putting a hand on the knights shoulder as he leaned in close somewhat towering over the shorter, still seated man, "if you _ever_ hurt her,  an arrow is the only hard thing anybody will find there." He added with the politest of grins, pointing towards the mans groin with his other hand. 
Eliran straightened up and then grabbed his towel, "well can't stay to long, it was nice chatting" he said cheerily before stepping past Elfriede, giving the man a light pat on the shoulder before walking out of the bath.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-27*

Elfriede sat stunned for a minute as Eliran walked out of the bath room. *Did.. that bard just threaten me?* Not entirely sure what transpired at the end, what he got from it was to not hurt the Princess. Which, of course he never meant to. He left the conversation once again unsure of where he stood with the teal eyed bard.
---
Elfriede stood and wrung out his hair the best he could, pushing it back once more to get it out of his eyes. Faun finished up bathing and returned tot he clerk to retrieve his clothes and armour and donned them both, making sure to of course tip the clerk and offer a small prayer to the goddess. 

*What to do for the rest of the day...*

[end aside 💦💦 ]

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-03*

```Location: Trisp Streets
Characters: Eliran, Elfriede```
Eliran immediately noted the fact that the knight was starting to get tired of him. "Look I know I'm probably grating on your nerves," he admitted, "but I dont know where Afrin is and I wanted to ask about something you two mentioned at dinner last night. And well... I knew you were coming out of the bath soon" Eliran looked away slightly, looking a little embarrassed to mention it _I literally just threatened him this is awkward_

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-04*

Faun looked the elegant, yet brazen bard up and down. He close his eyes and sighed lightly. "Alright."

He eyes reopened and his gaze returned to meet Eliran's, smiling lightly. "What can I do for you Mr. Canterat?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

"Well... it has to do with the girl named Enera..." Eliran started, with a look of concern he looked around, "sorry is there somewhere we could discuss this privately?" Eliran asked scratching the back of his head.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-05*

Elfriede eyes flickered at the recognized name. He sighed lightly and waved for Eliran to follow him. *He was going bring him directly to the monastery, but something told him they shouldn't have this particular conversation there.*

Faun instead stopped short and turned back to him. "Perhaps we should return to where you are rooming actually."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

"Ah yes... that would probably be a good place" Eliran nodded, "ok then I guess follow me." He said as he began to lead the way, checking briefly to make sure the Faun was following him. After they had started walking, Elirsn asked, "Sir Faun?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-05*

Elfriede was passively following him and his eyes had glazed over a bit as he began to get lost in thought about Enera... And the ever persitant thoughts of the princess... Eliran called out to him before he got too deep.

Elfriede glanced up to him  walking ahead of him. "Hmm?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

"Before we talk about Enera, how well versed on Calloran and Eraian relations?" He asked, looking ahead again.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-05*

Elfriede slowed down his walk briefly, then sped back up to catch up, slightly caught off.gaurd by the question. 

"I know enough that we're.... the countries are not on good terms..." He said semi matter-of-factly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

"To put it simply yes" Eliran replied, "and in recent years things have not been improving. It's part of why Afinas trip is inportant. A kind of show of good graces."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-05*

*Elfriede nods a bit*
"Yes, I am aware of that sir Canterat. I personally would like to see it through, I think our countries could do much for eachother while still maintaining our individuality. It'll take alot to convince the older folk of such, but perhaps in time...?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-06*

Eliran shook his head, "the key word I used was _show._ While Afina's trip here seems like a step in tensions between Eraia and Callora." He explained, "There are few that think it will lead anywhere, especially here in Eraia." They arrived at the inn, "lets head inside."

```End Aside```

```Location: Elirans room :lenny: 
Characters: Eliran, Elfriede```

As Eliran opened the door he looked at his room. It had remained a slightly disheveled mess, with an unmade bed and a his previous change of clothes still on the ground in the corner. On his desk remained his lute case, and not far from it one could spot an oddly designed bow and a quiver of arrows. "please take a seat" Eliran offered Elfriede a chair as he went to his travel sack. "Would you like something to drink? Its been a hot day." He offered casually.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-08*

Feeling on the cooler side from just finishing his bath Elfriede held up a hand and shook his head, politely denying a drink. He moved to sit down glancing about the room, inspecting what he had made of it in such a short time of living there.

Faun glanced back over to Eliran digging through his bag. "How long do you plan on staying in Trisp?" He asked casually, slightly curious.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-08*

"Your loss," Eliran responded to Elfriedes refusal, pulling out a small bottle and cracking it open as he sat down. 
"To be honest I hadn't planned on being in Trisp at all. People pay a lot to get news from across the border however, and my companions needed to come." He started, "though now with what happened at the border and the fact Afrins here... I'll probably hang around till she leaves"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-08*

"Ahh. I see, since shell only be here for a little while longer I suppose that's fine." Faun adjusted himself and placed one hand on his pommel as he usually would.

"And...what is it about Enera?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-08*

Eliran looked at Elfriede, thinking.
"What we're about to talk about... is a dangerous topic." He leaned forward putting his elbows on his knees, "I need you to swear you'll help Afina no matter what."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-08*

Elfriede leaned forward. Puttying his hands on his thighs, "Of course!" He said excitedly.

He leaned back and broke eye contact, a bit embarrassed at his overreaction. "I will."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-08*

Eliran stared at Elfriede for a moment, then stood up and walked over his desk, seeming to fiddle with something on top of it "even if the people who are threatening her are Eraian?" He asked not looking back to the knight.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-09*

Elfriede raised an eyebrow at that. "We'll see, I doubt anyone would be foolish enough to attack a princess... at least an official wouldnt. The reprocussions would be immense, even for a fanaticist... or someone that still holds the old beliefs. Regaurdless, I'll be sure that whatever happens is just. I serve Lady Lylalel, but I am also not a fool." 

Faun began to mull over what the Canterat had said to him and came to an odd conclusion. "What do you think this had to do with Enera?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-09*

Eliran turned and leaned back against his desk, facing Elfriede again. "My companions and I are looking for a young girl, in her teen years. Years ago she was kidnapped from a Calloran town next to the Eraian border. Apparently she was a growing to be a talented self taught light mage." Eliran picked up the arrow lying on his desk and fiddled with it a little, "Care to guess her name?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-09*

Elfriede sat there for a bit. Perhaps it was coincidence, and perhaps... Regaurdless he wouldnt rush to any conclusions for this scenario. He sat up and stretched.

"I'll be sure to keep an eye out for information that might serve promote or disprove your theory. If that is all, I'll be going. Of course I'll be sure to keep this between us."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-09*

"So you can't tell me anything about Enera at the moment?" Eliran asked, "Well I guess that was to much to hope for." he sighed standing straight. 
"Well I guess thats everything. Would you like to join me as I look for Afina?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-09*

"I.. need to think.. I'll catch up with you later.. or sometime in the next few days to let you know what I've discovered. I really must return for a bit of training before the night draws in."

"Unless she's at the monastery, I'll be returning there now. If she's not there... Perhaps she took a walk out into the market?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-09*

"I'll join you en route to the monastery then, it's the only solid place I'd guess she would be at." Eliran picked up his lute case, "I'm a bit concerned my friends might have gone looking for Enera there and caused unnecessary trouble anyways. Having tact is not how I'd describe them."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-09*
