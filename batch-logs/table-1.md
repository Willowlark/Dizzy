```

**Round 1**

The less popular West Market of Theanovene is no less busy than the main, Eastern Market. While getting permission to build a stall in the Eastern Market is an impressive achievement, getting a stall in the Western Market is about as difficult as convincing a dog to wag his tail. All sorts of assorted curio shops crop up overnight (and disappear just as quickly) in the Western Market which make it an interesting place to explore, if you keep your wits about you. 

A few such explorers have entered the Western Market today. Despite entering separately and having never met, the two are following the same rumor to the same place; a small potion shop. This shop has garnered quite a bit of fame (or perhaps infamy) for it's potions both not doing what they're supposed to and doing all sorts of odd and interesting things instead. The latter is certainly something to make anyone curious, especially for someone who has something odd and interesting to resolve. 

(OOC: OOC stands for *Out of Character*, we have channels for this buy I may throw them in as the GM. I've set a scene here to bring you all together, but going forward it's what your characters want to do, and how they interact with things and people.

Don't forget to describe your character for the rest of us, no harm in details! First posts are a nightmare, if you're stuck just describe what you're doing at the market.)

**Heroth** - *2017-10-02*

Amidst the crowd walks a shrouded figure concealed by a tattered hood and worn robes. His dark eyes are hidden behind his black wavy hair, and he walks with his head down blending into the sea of people unnoticed and drawing no attention. Hidden beneath his shrouds a string of tomes hang by his waist on a striped leather belt. He is the dark mage Ewan, and large busy crowds like this have often proved that if you keep an ear to the ground, a busy market of common folk can prove a useful place to gain information unnoticed, listening to rumors and learning of questionable characters. 
The streets are buzzing with talk of strange magic and misterious potions. Perhaps this is nothing more than a novice mage who has not master his potion-making craft, but Ewan is not the type of person to expect the best case scenario. Above the busy street walking across the tops of market tents a silver cat like specter watches over Ewan, staying by his side. The cat spirit goes unnoticed, keeping above the line of sight of your average market dweller and staying in tune with any danger that might come to it's companion. As Ewan approaches the rumored potion shop, the Silver Spirit Knoll becomes uneasy and disappears into a mist above the entrance of the shop. Ewan pretends to be interested in buying a potion as he tries to determine if they pose any danger to the people of the town.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-02*

A neat row of crates covered by a simple sheet served as a makeshift table for vials and bottles of many shapes and sizes. Some had labels scribbled on, most were blank. Nokri herself was barely visible to passer-by behind these crates, sitting cross-legged on the ground with her back to the wall and chewing on some crackers from the general shop she was set up in front of. The owner very generously let her set up shop in this prime location for a week in exchange for curing (and keeping quiet about) his wife’s awful foot fungus.

At first glance, Nokri appeared standoffish yet unimposing. She was obviously not native to Theanovene what with her tanned, freckled skin and bright blonde hair that was braided and tied back with a bandana. But she had been around long enough to establish herself within the city. Her appearance was tidy in a light long sleeved shirt and long skirt and she always smelled subtly of herbs. Occasionally she would warily peek out over her merchandise, scanning the throngs of people for any gullible chumps or past customers who would’ve been less than pleased with their purchase and perhaps seeking her out to complain.

    Several hours ago this spot was perfectly encompassed in shade. But now, the sun had shifted and begun to cast light on her wares. The different colored liquids within refracted a speckled rainbow across her face. The regulars she was kind to had been spreading news of her wares and once or twice an hour another stall somewhere in the market would refer someone her way, not to mention all the great traffic from the general store. Travelers looking to stock up on medical supplies, children with bedridden grandparents, a couple of bored teens with a stupid bet, and all sorts of people passed her way. Whenever she noticed a new customer approach Nokri would stand up, dust off her skirt, don her brightest customer service smile, and call out “good day!”

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-02*

As Ienzo wonders around the market looking for anything that catches his attention. He makes sure to keep the hood from his navy blue cloak covering his long black hair and dark circles under his eyes. His large figure makes it hard for him to blend in properly. As he wonders he overhears a group of kids talking about the potion shop he has heard about. Without trying to seem suspicious he ask the kids for directions to the shop. After they tell him they run off laughing and giggling, he could hear one of them say something that sounds like, "he is far braver than us I would go nowhere near that creepy shop.". With that bit of information he decides to take the path the kids described to him. As he nears the shop in question he sees another person enter the shop. After waiting a moment he follows the person in. As he enters he sees two people in the shop, "Hello everyone".

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-02*

Theanovene - This is where Aldus has ended up. It has taken one ship ride to the mainland and a trek through Callora to get here, but he's here. He was told by a fellow laguz and bookkeeper in his homeland of Wynne that there is a potions seller here that may have something to cure his unique aliment. Aldus is intrigued - obviously, seeing as he was willing to travel all this way on hearsay, if a bit leary of the consequences this potion in question may or may not have. The climate has been getting consistently warmer the further south he has traveled - something new to Aldus, but not unwelcome.  A thin sheen of sweat gathers on his face and behind both sets of ears. 

The western market is busy - much busier than the ones at home, he notes as his deep emerald eyes scan the wares of each merchant. He pauses briefly to check a poorly draw map he acquired from a barmaid at an inn the night before. 

“It should be right around here somewhere?” he says, head moving side to side Just then he spots two hooded figures standing in front of what seems to be a makeshift sellers stall of sorts - judging by the array of colored liquids and powders set out on display. 

“Busy place” Aldus says under his breath as he approaches to join the two figures already at the stall. “Seems I didn't hear of the dress code” Aldus say to the two hooded figures in front of him.

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-03*

Walking through a market was usually not a stressfull task, but add a crate full of questionable potion materials and 3 little ones clamboring all around him, it may be a bit taxing.  But he was never one to shy from helping people especially an old woman.  "C'mon kids dont you have anything more fun to do?" Tikur asked, "Nope!" They all cheerfully responded, seemingly determined to  drive him crazy.  He sighed and continued on through the vibrant an colorful market  place.  "Now where in Lylalel's tits is this shop?" he said under his breath as he moved to a side street and set down the crate. "Now lets take a look at that map" he mutterd digging through his pack.  As he dug through the pack the kids clambored around him and started to badger him about nonsensical things.  Tired of the kids he used a little bit of magic to zap them on the nose to send them on their way.  Luckliy it worked and with a playful laugh they darted away weaving into the crowd.  TIkur stood up and streched out, putting his brown hair back into place and getting some grit out of his ear.  He yiped as he ripped an odd bug that wanted to make some of the fur on his ear a home.  He shouldered his pack, picked up the crate and headed on down the road blending into the crowd determined to find that potion shop. As he walked down the path he enjoyed the hustle and bustle and the cornucopia of  individuals.  Chuckling he was glad he wore his family armor as he noticed some shady characters in the alleys.  He continued on and eventually arrived at the shop.  "Finally, I can get rid of this crate" he sighed.  He headed inside and set the crate down, straightening his longsword and spellbook he looked at the gathering of people and wondered aloud "now where is the potion maker..."

**Bill** - *2017-10-04*

**Round 2**

Regalus of the The Emerald Goblet inn couldn't help but cock an eyebrow at the sight out his window. Not only customers for the squirt outside, but multiple. At the same time. Girl deserved the business, though he'd fall to the plague before he tried one of 'cures'. Regalus didn't trust anything not made by Tial. Nor would his risk his wife's wrath by having someone else's "cooking" again. Shaking his head to clear the memory of last time from his mind, he turns back to re-raveling the rope coils he was restocking, leaving his wayward 'charge' to her work. That said he kept an eye on the window when he could. One hooded figure is strange enough, but two is cause to be wary, no matter Theanovene's status as neutral ground.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-04*

What was this? In the span of only a couple minutes, a small crowd of odd people had shown up around Nokri’s modest store. Did someone put out a hit on her? She couldn’t have sold anything horrific enough to warrant that. At least, not to anyone with the kind of means or money to hire mercenaries. Judging by their appearances and demeanors the customers didn’t seem to be together. Two were covered from head to toe, albeit they each had very different fashion choices. There was a third man behind them and off to the side was another, donning armor and carrying around a crate full of who-knows what.

Nokri had goosebumps on the back of her neck and was ready to make a break for it should anything violent start. The couple that ran the general store would be of little use in a fight, plus they probably wouldn’t appreciate a mess in front of their shop. But before baseless assumptions came business. Maybe this was all a coincidence - what with different people around the market spreading word of her - and these customers would all soon be on their merry ways.

“Good day fellows,” she repeated cheerfully. “What can I do for you? Interested perhaps in a nice potion or tonic?” She exaggerated her words with an arm sweep towards the bottles and a slight bow, keeping her behavior as warm, unthreatening, and innocent as possible. “If you’d like to make a purchase I ask that you please line up, then I can help each and every one of you. One at a time!” Keeping them all in a neat row would also make it easier to keep an eye on everyone.

She turned to the closest person, presuming they would be first. “Looking for anything specific I can get you?”

**Heroth** - *2017-10-04*

Ewan was suprised by the potion seller's demeanor. This didn't seem like the attitude of a malicious mage set out to steal and poison the townfolk. A line formed with Ewan in the back, and while waiting he noticed the innkeeper from behind looking out his window at the scene playing out in the street. The other customers lining up at this shop also appeared to be from out of town and were rather strange. Perhaps they had business with the potion master, or they too were following rumors. Ewan decided to leave the back of the line and head inside.

"Pardden me innkeep, the potion maker out there. Does she rent that space from you?"

"And what business do you have with the young lady, another disgruntled customer? I won't be held liable for whatever it is she did to make you want to hide behind that hood"

Ewan approaches the counter and drops petty coin, sliding it to the innkeep
" You misunderstand good sir, I am simply new in town and was intrigued by the rumors of a potion seller who wears are more mystery than magic cure. I assume you are aware of the situation then?"
"Situation?" The innkeeper looks puzzled while he slides the coin off the counter and counts it in his palm.
 " Sure I've heard her argue with a few customers. A man looking for a potion to cure his baldspot only to be completely covered in hair, but nothing malicious and she pays her rent at the end of the week. So as long as her customers don't cause me trouble she can stay there. But I will say I've never seen so many out of towners in front of her shop."
" Thank you for your time sir."
Another dead end.
Ewan steps back out into the street and sees the potion seller still working threw the line.
The spectral spirit of knoll is sitting in the alleyway across watching the potion stall. Ewan gets back in line to listen to the strangers conversation to hopefully learn more about them.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

Aldus steps back as one of the hooded figures in front of him filters to the back of the line. He motions for the figure in the blue hood to go ahead. “I believe you were here first” he says, trying to be polite. Since he has arrived at the curious stall a fellow wolf laguz also joined the gathering, carrying a crate. Supply delivery? Aldus decides to offer his help to the stranger 

After the crate has been taken care of Aldus steps back into line and awaits his turn. The wide array of potions and elixirs are unlike anything he has seen before, that could be a bad thing or a good thing - he's not sure.  When he reaches the stall keeper he takes a deep breath. 

“Hello, I am hoping that you could help me with a very particular personal problem I have” he tries to keep his voice low as to not be overheard by others in the area, especially Tikur, he doesn't need a reason for anyone - more so one of his own kind to judge him. Leaning over the stall slightly he says “As you can probably tell I am a wolf, but I can’t…..” he fidgets with his hands nervously “ya know… transform” his voice is barely a whisper at this point, he glances back up to meet her eyes, smiling nervously.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-04*

Ienzo notices the person next to his gesture for him to go first. He pulls down his hood letting his long black hair free in the slight breeze. 
 " Greeting shopkeep, pleasant day were having today isnt it? It seems like im not the only one who has head a word or two about your shop." Ienzo glances behind him and lets out a little laugh.  "I hear from people all over about you shop, it's quite natorious with the locals.  I wanted to inquire about a potion or tonic that could help ease mussle pain, do you have any such item in your inventory?"  As  he waits for lady shopkeeps responce he spies a gentleman looking out the window. The first thing that comes to Ienzo's mind is to wave as he thinks it would be the polite action to take at the moment. He thinks to himself when hes done at the stand he should check out the general store as well.

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-05*

As Tikur was waiting for the line to go down a fellow wolf laguz had introduced himself and helped him move the crate of ingredients over to the side of the shopkeepers stand.  As he waited for the line to go down he read his old masters spell tome trying to piece together some of the more complex spells from the burnt pages.  Guess work was probably not the safest way to do this but he hadn't found another way yet.  After the line had dispersed he closed the book popped it under his arm and went to the front of the stall.  With a warm smile he introduced himself "Hello shopkeeper, nice day we're having aren't we?  I was asked to bring this crate of potion ingredients to you from an old woman on the outskirts of town.  She said you didn't need to pay her as you were a good customer of hers.  Now did you want the crate here or someplace else 
as it's decently heavy..."

**Round 3**

On the other side of the market, a starry eyed youth wanders about on a quest of his own. The market is especially busy where he enters from, his vision blocked by the wood stalls that made the area look more like a carnival than a market. While not young enough to provoke worried looks he's not old enough to be just another man on the street and the occasional shop keeper looks his way.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-09*

As requested, the customers all lined up. ‘*Dealing with this ought to be easy, and then I can take a break*,’ Nokri thought.
--
First up was mister blue-cloak, who was surprisingly congenial. His quip about her notorious store caught Nokri’s interest. “Oh, really?” she giggled in response. “Never knew I had such a name for myself!”

Something caught the stranger’s eye across the way and he waved, but whoever or whatever it was had moved away from the window by the time Nokri glanced up there. It was true that more and more people were recognizing her. Perhaps a change in location was in order, or she could count how much savings had been stored up and lay low for a bit. With recognition came its downsides and it’s best to be safe than sorry.

“So you’re in the market to relieve muscle pain? Of course I’ve got just the thing!” It was a common request, and so right at the edge of the table were a half-dozen or so bottles, each containing a yellow-red liquid and a label that read ‘pain relief’ if you stood back and squinted long enough. Mixed in were one or two bottles of a thicker brown liquid that read *for fatigue*.

“The ones on the table there have a tart flavor to them because they contain cherries and other fruit, but if you’d prefer something else I’m sure I have a different flavor!” Though, the latter option probably wouldn’t actually soothe anything, seeing as she would just be taking a random unmarked vial from behind the display. Nokri was also at least 60% certain that was the was trying to sell wasn’t expired. They were bottled within the last two or three weeks, probably, and definitely kept out of direct sunlight for most of the day. She’d make a new batch once her current one either sold out or turned obviously rancid.

--

Next in line was a laguz, speaking so low that Nokri had to lean in and seriously concentrate to hear him. Though laguz weren’t an odd sight in Theanovene, Nokri found them weird. It wasn’t until she came to the city a year ago that she saw one in real life for the first time. Most of her customers were humans, though a beastperson might stop by every blue moon. Did human medicine even work on laguz? She had no idea.

“Oh my. Is that rare?” she asked upon hearing that this customer couldn’t transform. Laguz transformation was, again, something she had little knowledge of and only ever saw in the form of drawings in books. She looked at the customer and steadily met his gaze, trying not to stare at his ears or think of distracting questions (‘*if he looks like an animal does he smell like an animal? Asking would probably be rude*’). If this transformation issue was a big problem, maybe it would be worth researching for profit.

“I’ve never heard of such a thing, but I’m also not very well-versed in laguz issues. I could sell you some nutritional supplements if it’s a physical issue, but at the moment I’m not sure if I have something that’ll help. What have you already tried?” Knowing what doesn't already work would be a great first step and save her a ton of time, plus the trouble of having to find a guinea pig to test on.

--

The third customer was another laguz. ‘*Huh. Two in one day.*’ Oddly, he was carrying a crate for her. The one that was probably supposed to be delivered five days ago.  Why here and now, of all places? She internally sighed, now knowing that she had a heavy box to take care of and a customer who probably wouldn’t buy anything.

“You carried that all the way here?” Nokri gasped in fake concern. “I’m sure you’re tired, but can I trouble you to bring it inside this general store here? Tell ‘em it’s mine and to put it in the back, they shouldn’t give you trouble.” In truth she would need the crate at home, but no way in hell was she letting anyone know where she lived. It would take all evening but she could store the crate at the shop and carry its contents home bit by bit. If the shopkeeper didn’t like it she could just withhold his wife’s treatment and that’d sure shut him up.

“Hey, take one of these anti-inflammatory potions when you’re done. It’ll help with any muscle fatigue you’ve got after lugging that crate around,” she said, gesturing to the reddish potions she offered to the first customer. *They’re going bad and have to go anyway*.

--

The last customer had disappeared for a short while and Nokri lost sight of him while dealing with the others. But soon enough she spotted the strange cloaked figure in line again. “Thanks for waitin’! What can I help you with?” she asked. “Perhaps one of these?” she jested, holding up another anti-soreness potion. “It’s been a real big seller today! Or are you in the market for something else?”

**lapost48** - *2017-10-10*

Weaving between people in the crowd is a trivial task for ZaRel. Finding someone in it is another matter entirely, especially since his eye level is around the average shoulder level of most people in the crowd. His ash white hair, which is just long enough to cover his ears, gets tossed around with each well placed step he takes to avoid yet another person who did't see him in the hustle and bustle of the market.

He looks around for the large man that he heard a rumor of when he first came to this continent. *Large and intimidating. Large and intimidating.* He chants to himself in his mind. Within what seems like the most unorganized chaos he has ever seen, being the business of the market, he notices an orderly line of people waiting to speak with a girl even smaller than ZaRel himself. And first in that line, a large and intimidating man crouching down in a seemingly gentle way speaking with the girl. *Large, intimidating, and a hero to children! This must be the man from the rumor!*

ZaRel increases his pace and weaves through the crowd in a rush to get to this man before he moves on to another place. Surely a man a well traveled as the man from the rumors doesn't stay in any one place for long. Just as suddenly as ZaRel increases his pace, the market becomes even more crowded to a point where ZaRel even begins to have trouble squeezing his way through. He looks back and notices a larger number of people looking at him than when he first got to the market. He then realizes his hair, through the constant tossing from weaving his way through the crowd, has gotten stuck behind his ear revealing the pointed tips. ZaRel immediately covers his ears again and tries to push is way through the throng of people now in his way. *I can't let these people stop me from getting to him!*

By the time ZaRel makes it through the crowd the large man is no longer at the girl's stand, but is instead making his way into the store she is set up outside of. ZaRel walks over and manages to walk into the general store right behind that large man. With a voice backed by unquestioned confidence, ZaRel grabs the mans cloak and speaks to him. "Sir, I've traveled a long way to find a man matching your description. I would like to establish if you are in fact the man I've heard rumors of."

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-10*

As Ienzo thanks the friendly shopkeep and prepares to walk away he remembers he wanted to check out the general shop in front of him. As he enters he great the man he saw gazing out the window and begins to look around. As he walks around he begins to think to himself, "After you been in so many general stores they all seem to look the same, the only things that change are the faces". After inspecting several shelves he feels a tug on his cloak. He looks over to see a rather small figure next to him asking to speak to him. "Hello friend, you wish to speak to me about a rumor? If that's what you want I'm free to talk, let's move somewhere less crowded before we speak so no unwanted attention gets drawn.? The two leave the general store and look for a rather private place to converse.

**Heroth** - *2017-10-10*

Ewan had made it to the front of the line at the potion stall, and after learning it was mostly harmless and word of mouth from a few disgruntled customers had distorted it's reputation, he wasn't quite sure what to buy. The sound of a potion that relived soreness is a luxury Ewan normally didn't concern himself during his travels. He had been tracking a platoon of Dreca forces, but the trail had gone cold in town, and while trying to gain information on where the platoon was heading heard tale of this potion stall. 
'Perhaps fate has brought he here to rest,' Ewan thought to himself. 
At any rate the inn seemed like a decent spot for information, and it would be good to try a potion in a safe spot just to make sure the rumors aren't true.
"I think I will see what all the excitement is about and try your tonic good madam."
Ewan paid for his muscle relief elixir and went back inside the inn. He found an empty seat in the back corner of the bar area of the inn. He order a small drink to have with the potion while Knoll sat under the table circling around Ewan robes. Ewan keeps scanning the room and kept his ears open to listen for any news of attacks by Dreca while the effect of the potion begins to take effect

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-10*

Disappointment comes over Aldus almost immediately at the potion seller responds. She obviously not familiar with laguz if she has to ask that question. Something that is made more apparent by the fact that her eyes start wandering to his grey and brown ears atop his head before she locks eyes with him directly. He tries not to let his emotions display on his face too much though as to not offend her, although his first impression isn't great, and his faith in her abilities is now low he decides to entertain her further questioning.

“Well I’ve tried quite the array or herbs and roots, I’ve switched my diet multiple times, and also tried meditation and stretching rituals. No other laguz I know or have heard of has this issue, so yes it is quite rare. Perhaps you might have an associate or another person you might recommend to me? Perhaps someone with more experience in my species?” He hopes he’s not coming across as rude, he offers a shy smile to try and lighten his tone.

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

**Round 4**

As the Wynnite wolf describes what remedies he's tried in the past Nokri recalls reading about a particularly odd herbal remedy. It's more of a legend than a recipe really. The recipe comes from stories of old, stories of a potion that elder laguz would take that revitalized their beast form. Even laguz nearing a century in age could run wild with the pack like they were just teenagers, after but a single drink of the recipe. Legend states it can cure a laguz's wild form of any wound, and ailment, and maybe even bring the form for the Wynnite before her. 

That said, this potion became a legend for one particular reason; the key ingredient is a herb called *Fyarala*, native only to the western coast of the mainland. No one can say why it grows there, but expeditions to find it elsewhere have never bore fruit. The ashen green herb is highlighted by darker speckling on the underside of it's leaves. Ever since Eraia came into it's own as a nation no one has been able to get to the plant; Eraians themselves unwilling to retrieve it as 'preventing Lylalel's light from returning to her is heretical'. While the potion follows a surprisingly modern formula, the difficulty of getting the keep ingredient and admittedly limited user base has left the potion naught but a footnote in an advanced potion crafting handbook.

A group of Drecian soldiers walk through the crowded market. They stand out like a sore thumb, despite their jovial attitudes given their complexion and full armor. Any Theanovian local would recognize them as a caravan guard; waiting for their wagons to be loaded before heading back to their camp. While obnoxious, they don't seem intend on causing trouble for anyone the market. 

The first man in the group, by some form of luck, looks over to see the dwindling crowd around Nokri's stand and decides it's a good chance to visit what must be a normally busy stall. He waves his companions along, and they step up to the shop.

"Hello! We fine working men would love to sample some of..." he trails off as he tries to figure out just what the bottles on the counter actually are. "Whatever it is you sell here!" He says, giving up on his attempt and flashing a rather winning smile at the shopkeeper. His smile fades however, getting a good look at Nokri. 

"Oi. You're Drecian." He says, his tone flat and accusatory. "You a deserter? You must be. Only military personnel on the mainland." Behind him, his allies slowly move a hand to the hilts of their weapons. "Can't have no deserters in Lord Dryn's army. I think you'll be coming with us." The captain of the squad says. He places his arm on the hilt of his sword. "Don't make this ugly."

(ooc: Each of you can see this occurance; only Nokri, Tikur, and Aldus heard the man's speech. If you make to engage to deal with the *threat* these soldiers pose (Specifically they are *trying to capture Nokri*), remember to describe your actions in detail. The more details, the more dice you're awarded against the threat. If you'd like to note what aspect you're trying to invoke, you can note it in an ooc comment like this. I have final say of which aspect is most related to the actions you take however (otherwise no one would ever roll against their weaknesses lol). 

There is no defined number of enemies. If you want to engage one, there's one for you to engage. They are mooks, there are as many as needed for the action to take place. The *Captain* is a 'named' foe; Unlike mooks he gets to roll dice and has hit points.

This is going to be the first combat encounter! That said, just as much as you have no idea what to do, I don't either. It's a learning curve for all of us. We'll take it slow, ask any questions you have, and we'll sort it out as we go.)

Conflict: Dreca doesn't tolerate deserters; You're coming with us!

**lapost48** - *2017-10-12*

As ZaRel and Ienzo are heading back to the general store, ZaRel notices a group of men reaching for their swords and moving towards the potion shop keeper. Not being one to jump head-first into a fight ZaRel tries to ignore the commotion and head into the general store, *Not my people, not my problem*. However, he glances over at Ienzo, who looks as if he is about to spring into action, and decides that his guide would have a better chance of surviving this fight if he has some support.

ZaRel grabs Ienzo's arm and says, "Ienzo, I have an idea, you are going to have to trust me. I think we can handle these guys if we work together. I'm not much of a fighter, but keep an ear out for my instructions." ZaRel looks around, trying to find a vantage point he can easily reach.

He notices that near the top of the general store's walls some of the stone has crumbled away leaving a solid hand hold that he can use to access the roof. As soon as he finishes speaking to Ienzo he jumps up onto his shoulders and then uses him as a base to reach that worn away portion of the wall. ZaRel manages to grab the break in the stone and flip himself up and onto the roof (ooc: Agile Acrobat). His actions draw the attention of the crowd but it seems that the soldiers are more interested in the potion shop girl than their surroundings. *This can work in our favor*, ZaRel thinks to himself with a grin.

As he is taking in the information of this impromptu battlefield he notices two wolf laguz have also noticed the commotion and look as though they are about to jump into the fray as well. *So many people trying to get into others' business. I suppose their support does help us to a degree. If we could take out their leader we could break their morale and have an easier chance of forcing them to disperse. But how can I tell which one is their leader though!*

ZaRel shouts to Ienzo, "Try to keep that group of soldiers away from the potion girl! I'll try to convince the wolves to attack the guy near them!" ZaRel then looks to the wolf laguz, "Hey Laguz! Listen to me if you truly want to help that girl! Focus your attack on the man nearest to the potion girl, the large fellow will try to keep the rest of the soldiers off your backs!" (ooc: Meticulous Strategist)

Attack: 1
Defense: 1

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-12*

Tikur was about to respond to the shopkeeper when he noticed the guards approach and seem to want to do business.  When their attitude soured it became clear that they were going to start something whether or not she went with them.  When he spotted someone on the roof shouting a strategy to keep the shopkeeper safe.  He acknowledged the figure "alright! Time we had some fun anyway!" He shouts back up, whole he's doing that he unhooked his spell book from his waist and casts  Cage of Fearsome Lightning around the leader of the guards so that hopefully he'll rethink his course of action.  "Aldus, you ready for some fun?" He chuckles.  "Hopefully this all turns out well..."

**Heroth** - *2017-10-12*

As Ewan rested in the inn, he heard people near the front door start to murmur and look out the window. As he got up to check what was going on, the spirit Knoll dashed under the tables of the inn twords the entrance and through the wall into a puff of smoke. Ewan became concerned and hurried over to look outside, only too see a group of Drecian soldiers wearing Dryn's banner begin to reach for their weapons. 
Fury boiled Ewans blood as he kicked the inn door open. He dashed out and jumped into the street throwing back his cloak, grabbed his Necronomicon tome, and placed it down in front of him with his right hand. Dangling around Ewan's neck was a string of bones and with his left hand he pulled one off. A soldier began rushing at the mage who had casted a spell on their captain, but as he raised his sword Ewan chucked the bone at his helmet and the guard stopped in his tracks. It fell at his feet and the soilder looked down at the bone confused. The bone began to vibrate and melt into the earth while a black sludge began to bubble from beneath the cracks in the ground. The soilder turned to run away, but in that moment two undead hands of the zombie Murphy reached out of the ground and pulled the soldier down. The soldier tried to crawl away, but Murphy used the soldier's weight for leverage as he dug, clawed, and bit the solder until he pulled himself out of the ground (ooc:Murphy no!). Murphy grabbed the now dismembered sodier's body and flung it at the other guards, letting out a deep goulish snarling breath that was so cold it could be seen. The moan was an undead war cry, and he ready to fight.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-13*

As Ienzo see the soldiers moving twards the potion stand reading their blades he decides he may have to step in. Before he knows it his new found dragon companion used him as a springboard to reach the roof of the general store, before he disappeared from sight Ienzo can hear him say  "Try to keep that group of soldiers away from the potion girl! I'll try to convince the wolves to attack the guy near them!". Putting on his best currious face he decides to confront the soldiers head on. 
  " Why hello everyone, what did my little potion making friend here do that made you all so angry with her that you would draw your weapons? It cant be the potion she gave you didn't work mine worked fine." he says as he hides the potion she gave her so she cant see it.
  " This little witch here is a deserter, were from the Drecian army if you cant tell and theres not allowed to be any deserters in our army. This witch is comming with us!" the closest soldier starts to reach for the potion girl.

Ienzo quickly grabs the soldiers arm as he reaches it out. "Now lets not get hasty lets all calm down, I have dealt with your kind before. If this girl left Drecia it was her choice, and we have to respect that choice here if you don't like that were gonna have a problem." Ienzo whole pressence goes from calm to menacing quickly.
 "I dont think you know what your getting yourself into , we out number you and you dont seem to have a weapon with you it would be a slaughter if you wanted to try and stop us..." As he goes to finish his sentance Ienzo squeezes real hard and breaks the soldiers arm.(ooc: I dont need a weapon, I'm my own weapon.) With the soldiers cry in pain the others draw there weapons. one of them even gets ready to charge Ienzo with his sword. 
Ienzo waits as the seccond soldier begins to charge at him. As if he knew the perfect time Ienzo grabs the swords blade between both his hands and with all his might he twist the blade with his hands and the blade cracks into two pieces. "Now do we have to keep doing this or you gonna leave my little friend here alone?" Ienzo says taking off his cloak to reveal his hidden musscles(ooc: I dont need a weapon, I'm my own weapon and you need patience to catch a fish). He begins to think to himself i hope ZaRel can get the others to fight incase this decides to go south.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

“Hmmm. I’m afraid I don’t know anyone who might be familiar with this sort of thing,” Nokri stated in response to the lagul’s question. Though something did nag her in the back of her mind. Something, somewhere in one of her parents’ books? Ugh, she hated those books so much, but it was part of her *learning curriculum* to study each and every one of them. 

“There might b…” Nokri trailed off mid-sentence, losing her train of thought as a group of people caught her eye. Drecan soldiers, ambling around the market. She shifted to the side a bit, into the shade, hoping to go unnoticed behind her customers but it was too little too late. Here came the Drecan party. A nervous smile and meager “welcome” greeted them at the potion table. For a hot minute Nokri thought maybe she could get away with just selling them some wares, but obviously that wasn’t going to cut it. The captain noticed something was off and began running his mouth.

“Drecan? Me? Please, sir. I’ve lived i-“ 
Obviously they recognized her as a Drecan, despite attempts to play it off.
“I’m not-“ “I couldn’t possib-“
Any attempts to get a word in edgewise were ignored, and the boisterously loud voice of the captain was drawing plenty of interested looks from nosy passerby.

Taking a step back, Nokri knew this would probably end in bloodshed. Ignoring the customer still standing by, she turned to flee but was caught by the hair by one of the soldiers. As they were still on opposite sides of the stall, soldiers started coming around either side to surround her. Nokri rammed her side into one of the crates, sending several bottles on top crashing to the ground in hopes that the glass shards now covering the ground would serve as a deterrent. But the glass was easily crushed under heavy boots and the action only served to make everything smelly.

Then things got worse. Nokri hadn’t noticed, but her customers were fighting back. Why? She had no idea. But she knew she’d probably never sell at that market again. Shouts and punches flew everywhere, and she was fairly certain someone got whacked in the head with a severed arm. She didn’t have the strength to escape from her captor despite multiple poorly-aimed kicks to the shins and a whole lot of struggling, but the instant she felt his grip slacken Nokri jumped away with all her might and ran towards the side of the general store, trying to escape from the commotion.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-15*

Aldus and the stall keeper were continuing their conversation when quite the imposing figure saddled up to the stall demanding “free samples”. As if that wasn't enough he then began threatening the blonde shop keeper with -essentially- kidnapping? Because she’s Drecian, and a supposed “deserter”?

“What the hell-” Aldus says to himself with a snarl, letting one of his pointed canine teeth show He has the passing thought that perhaps he should just not get involved. But damnit this is bullshit, the stall keeper didn't do anything wrong, and there are obvious factors this jerk isn’t even considering! He rocks back on his heels and turns, taking a quick survey of what's around him to take advantage of. His eyes dart around his surrounding in a surveying manner. Nearby there is  pile of crates that are stacked up against a wall of an adjacent establishment, making an almost perfect set of wide stairs up the roof above. Good - better to have the high ground. 

At this point many people have stopped to see what all the fuss is about, which is good for Aldus. He makes easy work of weaving through the crowd and to the makeshift staircase of crates.  He springs from one crate to the next with an exaggerated bend and squat of each alternating leg. In a matter of seconds he reaches the top of the roof. He positions himself with his right leg bent and his left leg straight to compensate for the slant of the roof under him. He pulls his oak bow from his shoulder where it has been resting and quickly pulls and nocks an arrow from his quiver. He pulls back, aiming for the space between the collarbone and shoulder of the one who he heard threaten the stall keeper directly and fires.

Not waiting to see if the shot lands Aldus immediately turns his attention to one of the other seemingly lesser soldiers. Extracting another arrow from his quiver he takes aim again this time at the soldier’s left ankle. Firing true, his arrow sails through the air making easy work of the soldier's boot, it connects solidly with it's intended target. The soldier falls to his knees and then to the side, grabbing at his now debilitated ankle. Aldus lowers his bow to assess the damage, and realises that others - the same people that were at the stall before - have joined in to defend the stall keeper as well. He cracks a toothy grin at the realization.

(ooc: Keep your last round in mind as you write what happens next in your part of the fight. If you got hit, include that as part of your response. If you're doing well, run with it!)

(ooc: When describing a generic mook, give them a simple, identifiable trait. *The guy the goatee* or *the girl with the blonde ponytail* or *the guy whose got 3 daggers on his belt*. It'll make figuring out whose interacting with what mook so much easier for me, as well as for each other. These details shouldn't do any more than identify them, *the guy with the legendary sword excalibur* isn't going to be a simple detail. Rank is another one to avoid, it gives the mook a reason to get upgrade by me into a full *named enemy*.)

The Drecian captain swallows audibly. Despite the rather immediate and aggressive response on the part of what look like total strangers he shows just why he's in charge. 

"They drew first blood boys, but it's not ours that'll coat the streets!" He shouts as he draws his sword. He rolls out of the way of the fearsome lightning cage, his warrior instincts guiding him through with only a glancing blow. He looks back at his men and points his blade forward. "What are you waiting for? Give em HELL!" He belows and the men charge forward, engaging the combatants in twos and threes each.

The captain himself closes the distance between himself and Tikur. He leans into it at the last moment to do a triangle of slashes, the first low across Tikur's thighs, then up across his chest and the final one return the blade to the ready. The captain stays in close, not willing to let the spell caster sling more magic. 

"You'll regret attacking Dreca. Everyone will." he says with a chill in his voice. The catchlights to his eyes are gone, only the dark pupils seems to stare at Tikur.

---

The door to the general store slams open and the bear of man that goes by Regalus steps through it. 

"Kiddo, get in 'ere!" he shouts at Nokri. While his stature makes him look more than capable as a fighter a trained eye can notice his hand quivering on the doorknob of the door. Still, he looks pointedly at the young girl who he's gotten to know in the last few months. While she's a tad... quirky, Regalus had picked up a soft spot for the girl.

**lapost48** - *2017-10-17*

*I overestimated how much he could handle.* ZaRel thinks to himself as the soldiers split up and gang up on each of the friendly fighters 4-to-1. He is visibly shaken by his own miscalculation, the color slightly drains from his face as he faces the diappointment within himself. *If I can't give proper direction then I might as well try to add another body to the fray.* ZaRel then jumps off of the roof of the general store, completes a flip and lands on the ground with a somersault that forms into a sprint towards the Captain. *That spellcaster may be in trouble if he doesn't know how to fight hand to hand. I may not be much help myself, but maybe I can at least distract the guy he is fighting so that he can get a chance to make attacks.*

As ZaRel reaches the fighters he runs behind the Captain and hits him with a couple small jabs. His small stature doesn't have much power behind it, but it may be anough to pull his attention off of the spellcaster. When the Captain retalliates ZaRel avoids the strikes adeptly by limboing away from horizontal strikes, spinning away from vertical strikes, and jumping back from thrusts. As he maneuvers his white hair flows around, however, he makes sure to keep his ears covered. A fight with soldiers is definitely not where he wants to be recognized for what he truly is. After each dodge ZaRel places a couple well placed jabs to try to knock the Captain of balance so that he forgets about the spellcaster and focuses on the child that is moving around so quickly.

ZaRel grows bored of dodging and jabbing very quickly. He wants something else on his mind. He glances around the battlefield at his allies being attacked by the soldiers. ZaRel shouts out warnings to the outnumbered foes between dodges and jabs. "Ienzo, eyepatch behind you!" as a soldier with an eyepatch and a scimitar sidesteps out of Ienzo's sight and tries to get a free hit on the unarmed man. "Potion girl, duck!" as a bolt flies towards her, shot by a short man with a thick beard holding a crossbow. "Archer, their bowmen are taking aim at you. You'd best take them out first before supporting us!"

After that last command the Captain nearly chops ZaRel's arm off so he makes the tactical decision to retreat from him and help the others. ZaRel removes himself from the fight with the Captain with a few back handsprings and manages to get a solid 15 feet away from the captain. *To advance towards me is to retreat from the spellcaster. Make your choice.*

(ooc: Agile Acrobat)

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-19*

One of the Drecan soldiers blocked her way before Nokri could make it around the side of the building. She prompty spun on her heel and turned to run right back the way she came, back into the fray that was getting more chaotic by the moment. Due to the crowd and various acts of violence Nokri was stuck clinging by the wall. At any moment an opportunity could open up, allowing her to run past the fighting and escape. That was exactly the chance she was waiting for. But she was getting antsy and impatient.

No openings happened. Instead, one of the soliders saw her and, acting on adrenaline and bloodlust of the moment, thrust his knife at her shoulder. Blood soaked through her shirt and trickled down her arm as she attempted to kick him between the legs. She impulsively dug her nails into the skin around the wound as she covered it with her palm to slow the blood flow. Her arm was angled to protect her neck so that any attack aimed at a jugular would fall on her elbow instead.

The soldier was about to go in for a second blow when the door of the general store opened, smacking them in the side with enough force to knock off his balance. A familiar voice rang out. Almost blindly, Nokri followed it and ran into the store, rushing to the back. She could hear a female voice within the store screeching in panic and annoyance about the commotion out front. Gratefully, Nokri shouted a “thanks!” and rushed her way to the back of the store. Ideally, she would exit out a back door or window, but the soldiers might be expecting that and she didn’t want to bleed out. Instead she grabbed a piece of gauze from a shelf. Pulling up her sleeve hurriedly, she spit on the wound and began wrapping the gauze. Within seconds the bandaging was complete, leaving only dried blood on her arm and a throbbing pain that could be ignored in the moment, and she cautiously peered through a window to check the situation outside.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

An crossbow bolt whizzes by his right ear close enough to hear. Aldus recoils from the sound, startled by just how close it came to giving him an ear piercing - well, *another* ear piercing that is. He hears a warning of archers preparing to fire back at him come from a small voice below.

“You’re not kidding!” he responds- not really knowing who he’s talking too. His eyes narrow at the soldier that shot that bolt. 

Despite the uniform the shooter is quite the shady looking fellow, he’s smiling sickly up at him and with only about 3 teeth to do so with. Aldus straffes a few steps down along the roof to his left before pulling another arrow from his quiver and aiming it at the arm the soldier is using to support his crossbow. He pulls back once again and fires. Just as intended his crossbow clatters uselessly to the ground as the arrow connects and the man grabs at the arrow now embedded in his arm. Another archer steps in front of her fallen companion, definitely, vengefully - this one’s a woman with long dirty blonde colored hair pulled into a tight top knot. Fire in her eyes she returns the shot for her friend. Just in time, Aldus leans back on his thighs, straight backed as the arrow flies harmlessly past him. She grits her teeth angrily in response. 

“One for me, and one for you!” he says with a smile and shot to her hand. “And another one for your boyfriend too!”  intending to give Mr.Shady a wound on his other arm to match the first.

Incapacitating all the archers he can see, he scans the marketplace in search of the head asshole. He locates him near to where he saw him last, this time trading punches from a... small child? 

“Oookay then…” Aldus says under his breath “might as well help the kid out I suppose” He takes a few steps back onto the spine of the roof standing with his feet placed squarely beneath him he pulls out another arrow, takes aim and fires another shot at the one in charge, aiming at a pulled back arm readying to swing.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-19*

With all the fighting going on around him Ienzo tries to stay focused on the guys around him. He thinks to himself "I need to wrap this up quickly and help the others out as quick as i can." while he is distracted by his thoughts he hears a voice call out to him letting him know someone snuck up behind him.  with one swift motion he swings around and punches the soldier in his good eye. He picks up the  the blinded eye patched soldier and swung him like a club to knock all the soldiers around him to the ground. " your lucky i try not to kill unless I have too, is something like this really worth spilling blood over?" he asks the soldiers he just knocked to the ground.  After waiting a minute and the soldiers didnt answer he decides they aren't gonna change there minds easily.  He sees what looks like to be the guy in charge going after the mage and even wounding his new half-dragon friend. Ienzo looks at the soldiers and with his most mencing look tells them  "stay still or else, I dont want any innocent people to get involved in this stupid and piontless fight.  Ienzo slips up behind the leader looking soldier and tries to deliver a quick yet powerful punch to the back of the head hoping to knock him out in one punch, hoping he can end this scuffle before it esculates any farther.

Regalus slams the door to his store shut with a massive bang. He quickly drops the wooden doorbar into the slot and slumps slightly against the wall. 

"Nokri." he says without opening his eyes. "You're going to have to get outta town after this one." he pauses and his eyes open, though he's still looking down at the floorboard. "That's uh. Not cause I'm tell you to or anythin. Theanovene will deal with dopes like them-" he jabs a thumb in the direction of the chaos "given some time but you'll have to be out and away for that. Got anywhere you can travel to? Visit fam... Visit friends, or anything for work?" he finishes, looking up at the girl. The sheepish, worried look on his face speaks volumes.

---

"Damned! Where do you all keep coming from?!" The captain growls out as ZaRel pulls him from his blows against Tikur. He turns on a steel toed boot and slashes wide at the boy, only to hit empty air as the youth escaped his reach. To add insult to injury, as he steps forward to give chase an arrow hits his shoulder plate. The plate dents inward, cause the captain pain every time he moves his shoulder. He growls and spits in the wolf's general direction.

"To hell with this." He mutters. He runs around the side of Tikur, vaulting over what was once Nokri's stand to find himself in front of the door. He goes to pull the door open only to find it barred. He slams a gauntlet against the door in frustration. He grabs his blade with two hands and start to hack at the door hinges, hoping to destroy them before he is pulled back into the chaos behind him.

(ooc: We have an example of a side goal here. This is basically a sub conflict to the main one. It doesn't matter if he gets through the door or not at the end of the main conflict, but if he does it may make his victory easier. Side goals can take pretty much any form. They're a challenge you can attempt to defeat that will have some effect on the main conflict. You can direct dice at a side goal the same way you can a Named Enemy.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-20*

The shot hits as intended and the big man spits in Aldus’ direction. 

“Gonna need to spit a little higher than tha-” he’s cut short by zapping sensation tingling through his left arm and holding him still for just a second. The lightning bolt knocks him off balance , over backward onto the opposite side of the roof. But he quickly regains control of his limbs, and is able to stop himself from tumbling too far down and off the peaked roof onto the cobblestone below. 

He had checked for more archer’s - but not magic users. He crawls on all fours back up the roof, staying low he peers over the roof’s ridge. He spots the one who zapped him peering out from behind the corner for just a second before retracting out of sight. Aldus pulls his legs up underneath him in deep kneel and raises his bow up again this time holding it parallel with the roof, he pulls back and sucks in his breath holding it to steady his hand. Just as predicted the mage emerges again from his corner, hand outstretched, Aldus fires directly at that outstretched hand, piercing it directly through the palm. Aldus releases his breath with a huff. 

“Haven’t we taken down enough of you?!” by the way the fighting continues he takes that as a resounding “no”

Now he sees the captain again, this time trying to break down the door of the general store. *he must really want to get to her, doesn't exactly seem worth all the trouble to me* he thinks. He backs back down the roof - the side facing away from the fighting and sits down on the slant of the roof, he takes a few seconds to rifle around his belt pouch. His fingers close around a small glass vile and he produces a yellow tinged, syrup-like liquid. He grabs the cork with his teeth and pulls it out of the vial, then he spits the cork back into his belt pouch for recycling. He holds the vial in one hand while reaching around his shoulder with the other to pull another arrow from his quiver. He coats the tip of the arrow in the syrupy liquid and deposits the empty vial along with the cork.

The liquid is something made in his mentor's village, a slowing serum - non lethal. Although he’s only seen it work about half the time it is used, Aldus figures it worth a shot if it slows the captain down enough to buy the people inside a few extra seconds to find another way out and get away.

He returns to his former position and readies the coated arrow toward the captain. He pulls back hard but steadily holding his breath again. Aiming carefully at the same spot he hit the captain in before - figuring his armor to be weakened there - Aldus let’s fly again and releases his breath.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

"Yeah." Nokri's response to Regalus was rather halfhearted. She was more concerned with other things than the future at the moment, seeing as whatever happened in the future would be decided now. He was being oddly worried for her and it set her on edge just as much as the sudden thud against the door hinge.

"I've got somewhere to go. Don't worry 'bout it, I've had a backup plan for ages." (OOC: Unreliable Expositor.) Her voice took on a slight accent similar to that of the soldier's outside now that it didn't matter what she said or how she said it. Regalus was a good enough guy who likely already knew her origin. And if he didn't before he sure did now. Despite what she said Nokri had absolutely nowhere to go, but if she started running now she could figure it out along the way.

"Need help with that?" she asked, referring to the gradually weakening door. She owed Regalus big time for this, that much was true. If not for his intervention he'd have a lovely new red stained wall out front of his shop the color of her blood. But Nokri never asked for his help and didn't feel particularly inclined to stay and pay back the favor. "You got a plan at all? Otherwise I'll just book it, no lookin' back. You can have whatever's left out front," she remarked, only partially in jest.

**lapost48** - *2017-10-23*

As the captain flees from ZaRel to attack the door he looks around briefly for some more information so that he can come up with some plan of action. *If that door gives way we may have a problem getting the girl out of here. Who knows how long that may take Ienzo to get over and start travelling.* Struggling to find something to do he is at a loss. *I don't see any strategy. The others are occupied so it's up to the archer and myself and I don't know how much help the archer will really be from afar.* ZaRel looks around and notices that most of the common folk in the market have backed away sufficiently from the combat ensuing leaving a large open space that all of the combatants are fighting within. *I guess I have no option at this point.* he thinks as he reaches into the neck hole of his shirt and grabs a small jagged purple stone attached to a leather strap around his neck in his fist, and while making sure nobody sees the stone, releases the energy stored inside.

The energy crackles out of the stone in large purple arcs into his small body. ZaRel falls to his knees with a single fist on the ground, the other still grasping the crackling purple stone. The stone's form fades away as the energy is released from it. Once the stone is completely gone ZaRel's small form is instantly replaced by the massive form of a Deep Purple dragon with a large frilled crest on each side of his head and a line of small spikes starting from the top of his spine down to the end of his tail. He beats his large leathery wings against the air, filling out his wings, and blowing a heavy gust across the battlefield (which is now primarily taken up by his massive form). With this gust of wind, several of the soldiers are knocked off of their feet and scuttle back in fear of the visage before them.

ZaRel swings his tail down onto one of the soldiers that fell from the gust and the soldier ceases moving. ZaRel then turns toward the man chopping at the door and bellows in a deep, loud voice that begins shaking the nearby buildings, "Leave this place now! You have caused enough trouble for us! I do not care what this girl has done, but I have become irritated by your persistence! You do not wish the wrath of a god come down upon you and yours, do you!?" As he finishes this shout a large tuft of purple smoke shoots out from the sides of ZaRel's mouth and floats up without being dissipated by the wind.

Once the mortal responds to ZaRel he asks, with the same bellow as the first time, "What is your name mortal?!" 

A column of smoke that is now protruding from this dragon that suddenly appeared in the middle of the market is drawing eyes from all parts of the city and a few lands shortly beyond.

The Captain slams his blade against the door frame even harder when a story tall dragon replaced the brat on his right. His purpose for breaking through had changed completely however, his swings not powerful but frantic. Be that the cause of some other form of warped luck, he manages to force the splitering door bar apart and barrels into the room. Regalus is slammed into the wall behind the open door and the captain tumbles to the ground halfway into the room. He doesn't even look in Nokri's direction, he instead crawls behind the store counter completely out of sight. Regalus groans from behind the door, bruised but otherwise okay.

The men outside are rightly confused to see a dragon of all things, let alone one spouting retorhic about being a god. However, due to their familiarity with the Wyverns of Dreca's mountains and the natural response to kill what one is afraid of, they continue fighting. Some look for their captain, unable to spot him in his new position.

The onlookers renew their shouts and screams, far louder than when the fighting broke out. Many ran of course, but some are rooted to the spot. Pushing through them, from the northeast and south sides of the market respectively, are a group of Theanovene militiamen and Eraian soldiers. The Theanovene men, while not real soldiers, do their damnest to get up to the fighting and take some of the pressure off of the group fighting. They immediately engage the Drecians while shouting that Theanovene is neutral ground and if they don't cease their hositilites the council will be involved. An astute member of your group might notice they are also looking at you all while saying that.

The Eraians on the otherhand, had to pause for a moment. Each of them stared with awe at the dragon only a dozen yards from them. It only took one unsheathing his blade for the rest to follow. 

"That dragon is an agent of Lyarlel! It must be destroyed before it corrupts more of Lylalel's light! Slaughter it men, for this is a holy crusade!" one shouts and the lot of them charge with the fervor Eraia is known for. 

(ooc: The Theanovene men are allies for your group; they've reduced the drecian threat level, which was a bit high in hindsight (first ever combat rounds woo). The Eraians are not fully engaged yet and what becomes of them depends on your actions in the coming turn.)

The arrow hits its target just as a dagger thrown by a mustached man whizzes over his head. But then everything stops. Aldus stops too as the boy who was punching the capitan earlier transforms into a - dragon? A large purple dragon. As the dragon boy begins speaking to the attackers Aldus feels his lip quiver slightly and moves to duck back behind the ridge of the roof. 

For a moment Aldus thinks that maybe the dragon boy’s scare tactic will work. At least it works on the leader. But then he hears a rallying cry from the Drecians as they move to attack the dragon. Two new groups appear in the marketplace as well. From the roof he can see that the Theanovenes mean to help them out a bit here, even if they are shooting side-long glances to Aldus and the others as well. Another group of soldiers appears also, these ones wearing purple and black uniforms. Eraians? This new group makes a rally against the dragon boy as well. 

Aldus shifts nervously If I knew I was going to be caught in my own little world war maybe I would have stopped for tea and avoided this whole deal. He thinks to himself. 

Aldus moves to the edge of the roof and leaps gracefully into a roll and onto the ground behind the building. He proceeds to quickly walk out in front of the Erain soldiers facing them, figuring the Drecians are preoccupied with the dragon at this moment.

“Hey-hey-hey why don’t we just take a minute here and assess this situation. Im sure the good citizens of Theanovene would appreciate not having their streets coated in the gallons of blood that would surely come from a creature such as that, and I believe everyone here has seen enough blood for today - I know I have. Why don't you fine ladies and gentlemen help us, and the Theanovene militia detain these Drecian soldiers instead? Their leader happens to be hiding right behind that shop counter over there” Aldus says pointing to where the leader is cowered. “I’m sure he could offer you some information on Dreca’s battle plans and whatnot, which I’m sure your military would find invaluable, and look at that! They all seem to be distracted, nows our chance!“ Aldus turns out toward the marketplace with a sweeping motion of his hand, once his back is turned he meets eyes with the dragon, struggling not to shudder and mouths “GO!”  hoping that his way with words is half as good as it was at home.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-26*

“******! Why the ****** did I stay behind?” Nokri screamed at herself, but it was too little too late. The door had busted down and for all she knew without seeing his wounds Regalus was crawling off to die. As the Drecan captain fell to the ground Nokri sprinted out the doorway, taking the first opening she could to escape however far she could make it without being caught or followed. It was impossible to tell who was on what side, or even if the original conflict was still occurring given that one of her customers was now a giant smoke-exhaling lizard taking the brunt of the fighting. 

Quickly as possible, she went around the side of the building. The glass shards on the ground from earlier crunched underfoot, slowing her movements and getting stuck in her shoes. A laguz fell from the sky right in front of her as she turned the corner and caused her to falter, but he was busy with other things to pay her any mind. Escape was Nokri’s number one priority and she set off running once again, keeping her eyes low to the ground and prepared to barrel into anyone who might get in her way.

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Conflict: Dreca doesn't tolerate deserters; You're coming with us!

```

Despite Aldus's efforts, the Eraian troops march onward towards ZaRel's transformed state. They begin to encircle the dragon, waiting for an opportunity to enter within ZaRel's reach. Unlike the Drecians before the Eraian's actions are calculated and military; this chance to rid the world of Lyarlel's creation is far too important to not take as seriously as a battle with Dryn Wulfa himself.

After getting between the Drecian soldiers and their opponents, the Theanovene militiamen are able to talk the foreign soldiers down. The fighting breaks up and the Theanovians start rounding up the various combatants. If not for starting a fight in neutral grounds, the damage to property in the area would be more than enough reason to bring all the combatants to the stockades. Nokri's potion stand is all but destroyed (and the broken bottles are letting off one very powerful stench) while the general store has burn and slash marks on it's walls and roof. 

The Theanovian men started with the Drecians, but as they finish gathering up the military men they divide they're attention. A few men join the Eraians, attempting to at least prevent massive damages in the fight they can only predict is coming. The rest are turning towards the Drecian's combatants, two wolf laguz and the martial artist. 

(ooc: Combat has been resolved and lessons have been learned. Future combat should be a little better balanced. Anyone who lost all their HP in fight is now at whatever state they'd like to be in; you can be winded and waking up, or you can bounce up as good as new.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-27*

While he’s trying to convince them, he sees the potion girl pass the group, running  away from the marketplace and all this trouble. Once it's clear his feeble attempt at convincing the Erains isn’t going to work, Aldus decides he doesn't want to stick around to see what’s going to happen next. He runs off toward the direction the potion girl went, hoping he can catch up to her and ask what that was all about. He’s also still holding onto hope that she knows about *something* that may help him and is hoping to get the chance to ask. Behind him he can hear combat dying down and a couple of shouts, he decides to pick up the pace.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-10-30*

Theanovene was a huge city, perfect for hiding in, but also a pain to enter and exit. With her head down Nokri bumped into quite a few people and caused quite a small stir, but the died blood around her shoulder was just enough cause for people to let her be and not pursue the running girl any further. Adrenaline was pumping through her veins, driving her to escape, but her breaths grew ragged. The din of fighting was left long behind and only the sound of everyday city fare could be heard. Nokri stumbled to a halt a block over from the city entrance, doubling over against the cool wall to catch her breath. The sound of her own heartbeat made listening to the surroundings hard, but she couldn’t discern any threats. The alley she ran into was empty and offered her some peace to calm down. 

Sure, she had undergone worse in the military. But that was before, and this was now. Nokri didn’t exactly keep up her hardcore fitness regimen after moving to the city. Plus the fight was so sudden and unexpected. It seemed no matter where she went, Dreca would catch up eventually. So what to do now? Lay low, wait a bit, then pack up and ditch Theanovene. If she could get to her stash of cash Nokri could set up base somewhere new for a few months and earn some profit there before moving on again.

Footsteps nearby brought her train of thought to a screeching halt. Sweat dripped down her face as she looked up menacingly, preparing to rush off in the opposite direction if anyone came by.

**Bill** - *2017-10-30*

Theanovian miltiamen approach and arrest Tikur and Ienzo, binding their hands tightly with room. The men are not particularly motivated to do so, but they do their job well. As the two of you are brought over with the rest of the arrested individuals, one militiaman with his mid length hair pulled back into a ponytail says "Seems like you had the right intentions friends, but neutral ground is neutral ground. Please cooperate and we'll have this sorted out in a jiffy." He then jogs off to assist the rest of his squad.

One of the Eraians break from the circle and steps right in front of the draconic ZaRel. "Over here demonspawn?" he shouts. He bangs the hilt of his spear against his shield and makes a terrible racket. Everyone outside the Eraian unit is forced to throw their hands over their ears as all the soldiers do the same with their weapons. 

Unbeknownst to onlookers, the Eraians were doing far more than pissing off everyone around them. The signal started, soldiers on the nearby inn roof toss dozens of ropes over the dragon. The minute they do all of the soldier on the ground dive for an end each, pulling them tight around ZaRel's form. They stick their weapons into the ground, lancing the ropes for extra stability. One Eraian shouts to get some proper nets and men move like they've been posessed. The Theanovian militiamen don't assist, but they don't prevent the Eraians from their operation. The Theanovians were frankly put off by the idea of a dragon in the modern era what-so-ever, and had no better plan to suggest.

In short time the market comes together to provide enough netting and material to properly capture the dragon. The ponytailed miltiaman and the Eraian who was shouting orders before (A blonde, clean shaven young man in heavy armor) have begun an argument over the capture.

"I'll hear none of that!" The Eraian barks. "We captured the dragon, with our plan! You shall not take it from us! We even listened to your request to not engage it in full combat in your streets!"

"We can't have you dragging it through the streets either sir. We assure you, we have no interest in a mythical beast, especially one so tied with Lyarlel." the Theanovian says placatingly. The Eraian blinks at the religious reference, clearly this Theanovian was well studied. "We just want to lock the creature away while we coordinate a way to let you do what you wish!"

"We wish to slaughter the beast that taints Lylalel's lands, and we can simply do that her-" the Eraian is cut off.

"No no no, this is a market. Children play here. Where ever that thing is killed will be swimming in dragon blood, envitiably descrated as unholy ground by Lylalel. You can't slay it in the city, and that's all we ask! We want the same thing here sir!" the Theanovian pleas. Be it because of the second reference to Lylalel's religion or just common sense, the Eraian sighs and extends a hand.

"Alright, I believe you. You say you have cages in the travelling circus that can hold it?" The Eraian trails off, the two's voices returning to a normal level.

(ooc: This scene has ended. Status:
* Tikur and Ienzo have been taken to jail.
* ZaRel has been brought to a travelling circus and currently occupies one of the elephant cages, still in dragon form.
* Nokri and Aldus are together, Aldus tailing Nokri's escape. 
Table-1 is reduced to Nokri and Aldus. When Tikur/Ienzo/ZaRel are ready to pick up their scenes, they'll occupy table-3 or possibly a table-4 I'll add.)

```

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-01*

Getting through the crowd was made easier by the fact that people were still stunned by the potion girl pushing through just seconds before. As he comes around the corner of a building he sees the end of her blonde ponytail duck around another building into a small alleyway. They’ve been running awhile but Aldus isn’t fazed, “Keeping up with the pack is much harder than this” he thinks. He runs up to the alleyway and sees her there, getting ready to run again. “Wait!” he says,  hoping she will hear him out.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

A somewhat familiar face rounded the corner. It was the dog boy from earlier, who had gotten interrupted by the soldier's arrival. She vaguely recalled him not aiding the Drecans in attempting to capture her, and perhaps even helping her escape though she honestly hadn't paid much attention to whatever was going on at the time. Despite running all that way he didn't seem nearly as tired as she was. *And don't these guys, like, have super-powered scent receptors or some crap? S**t.* Absconding wasn't worth it at the moment. But if he tried anything Nokri would reopen the scabbed wound on her shoulder and run into the street, pretending to be some damsel in distress getting chased by the big bad wolf.

"Yeah. Can I *help* you?" Nokri asked breathlessly, her voice now dripping with sarcasm and strong hints of a Drecan account.  Though this was a customer, business hours had closed for the day and she decided to give up on the nice girl act. "What'd ya chase me for?"

[events of aside happen] 
```Location: Back streets of Theanovene
Characters: Aldus and Nokri```

After a short break to fully catch her breath and wipe the sweat off her forehead, Nokri led the laguz through the winding city streets. Most of them were dark and quiet, with the occasional resident sitting out front eyeing them as the duo walked past. "Did you say your name earlier? Mine's Nokri," she stated, figuring she might as well hear his name if they'd be travelling together. "I heal people. You?" After about fifteen minutes they turned down a street that looked identical to all the others and walked up to an indistinct door. Nokri swiveled her head around to check for nosy neighbors before unlocking the door. "Stay," she told Aldus, letting her inexperience with and insensitivity towards non-humans blatantly show as she held up her hand in a 'stop' motion and continued inside the house on her own, though she left the door open.

Nokri didn't have many things and her house was mainly empty aside from lots of random plant material laying about and an assortment of strange stains on the carpet. It was a very tiny one room home. Kicking some piles aside, she stuffed a weighty pouch  and several handfuls of potential potion ingredients into a shoulder bag before giving the room a quick glance to make sure nothing else necessary got left behind.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

Aldus follows the girl through some dark streets that look a little sketchy in his opinion but he tries not to judge. “Aldus” he says in response to her question. At least he can stop calling her potion girl now, he muses to himself. 

He’s a little put off by her command to him, but he gives her the benefit of the doubt for now that she didn't mean it offensively. He noseley looks into her home but listens and doesn't follow her inside the tiny room as nothing in there seems of much interest to him anyway. He leans against the wall outside the door, hoping they can get on their way soon.

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

(ooc: I've got nothing for you guys, keep on doing what you're doing.)

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

Nokri locked the door while leaving merely out of habit. Within days it'd likely get broken into and in a matter of weeks the landlord would resell it without her there. There still wasn't anyone around outside, but who knew who was watching from a window? "Alright... Albus, was it? Lets get a move on." Nokri knew the path to the outside of town but barely anything past that. If it wasn't marked on a roadside sign she would just wander wherever until arriving at some form of civilization. She opened her mouth as they neared Theanovene's border. "Before we leave, do you know how to get to this place?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

“Aldus, actually” he says matter-of-factly, following her down the street in front her small apartment. 

On their way out of town it becomes apparent to Aldus that he’s going to be playing navigator, and protector here. “Well, I have map” He says pulling a folded, and rolled up piece of parchment from a tube on his belt. He opens the map and holds it out, giving one end to her to hold up. “So I thought about that a little more while you were getting your things- I figured you'd probably want to stay away from any potential war zones as much as possible. So I suggest hugging the mountains through Calora instead - There doesn't seem to be any large villages or cities marked here so mostly just make camp along the way.” He runs his finger across the parchment drawing a trail around the mountains ”Shortly into Eraia there appears to be a small town to the west. Maybe stop there and see if we can find some direction on where to start the search? I admittedly haven't thought much further than that” He says shrugging “I’m kind of making this up as I go along”

**Bill** - *2017-11-09*

```
Location: Theanovene Observatory, NW district
Characters: Aldus, Nokri
```

You make good time through the streets, be it because of Nokri's ability to navigate the crowds or Aldus clearing a path for the small girl. Cutting through the Observatory park also saved you a fair bit of strife, the park mostly empty asides from older people feeding the birds and so on. The parks exits borders the Theanovene observatory on the north side, a pleasant offering to bring some green to the sprawling city of Theanovene. There isn't much in the way of trees in the park, but the flowers and manicured green grass do the job. 

Passing out of the north gate the Observatory is to your left. The core of the building is a upside down bowl shape, with a large telescope peering through the top. Half the dome's roof is missing, allowing the telescope to move but making poor weather a terrible problem. Connected the building, in the far corners from you, are two short towers with a connecting bridge between their upper floors. They rise to just below the telescope's height, as to not block the view from the device. Lights shine from these windows even at this time of day, assuredly hard working scholars in their studies. You can see the large oak doors in the center of the dome as you reach the middle of the courtyard. 

Beyond the observatory, there is a large courtyard in front of you. The maze of buildings doesn't resume for another 50 yards in the northern and eastern directions. The cobblestone was laid in such a way that, if one were to look down on the courtyard from on high, a concave lens shape would appear. 

From an eastern street a group of Drecian soldiers enter the courtyard. One kicks over a pot planter and growls something to his friends, which they vocally agree with. From what Aldus's lupine ears can pick up, they're rather upset about their treatment by the locals. They fan out slightly, enjoying the wide open courtyard rather than the dense Theanovene street.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-13*

“Shit” Aldus says under his breath as he sees the Drecians moving into to their left across the courtyard. He was hoping he wouldn't have to see any more of these people for a while, no such luck it would seem. 


He grabs Norki’s hand and starts guiding her toward the observatory while trying to be discreet about it, he doesn't want to make it too obvious he's trying to avoid the Drecians. He tugs her closer to him trying to make the two of them appear as a couple to onlookers, and whispers “play along and if this goes south - we run”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-13*

Nokri perused Aldus's map with a blank face, studying the area and connecting what she saw on the paper to what she knew of the city and its surroundings.  She merely nodded along with what he was saying, flatly agreeing that they should avoid warzones. "Also. The less we stick out, the better. I can camp, that won't be an issue, unless bandits."  After a few moments she added "this plan sounds better than any. May as well, we can adjust what we do as we do it to best suit the situation."

Her mind was still on the map and their journey ahead as they walked into the courtyard. The sound of broken pottery in the distance caught her attention, and some loud voices though she couldn't make out what they were. "Hey. D'you th-"

Before finishing her sentence, Aldus had already sprung into action and they were moving in a new direction. It made sense what he was doing, but Nokri was not happy about it. She resisted wrinkling her nose and pushing him away, and instead tried to play along. She tugged the bandana on her hair back so it would cover up the blonde color and briskly tucked what she could of her braids into the back of her shirt. The smile she donned at first was terrifying and worthy of haunting children's nightmares, but would adjust to a proper smile once she focused more, acting kind and innocent like she did at her shop. "They probably aren't cultured enough to follow us in here, hmm?" she asked quietly as they came close to the observatory.

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

The Drecians make it to the center of the courtyard as you reach the observatory. They've slowed down, judging by their boot steps. A peek over your shoulder reveals they've sat down in the middle of the courtyard, now holding bottles of something. They look decidedly comfortable over there.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-16*

As soon as they are inside the observatory Aldus let's out a deep sigh of relief. He then realizes he's holding Nokris hand a little too tightly and releases it. He runs a hand through his hair nervously and looks about, “Come on, let's see if we can't find an exit in the other side”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-16*

Inside the observatory smelled scholarly, like books and nerds. A scent Nokri wasn't particularly fond of. With her hand finally free, Nokri wiped it off on her shirt and took a few steps back. "*Thank* you," she muttered sarcastically to her two-time savior. "Yeah, there should be another exit somewhere. Stupid if a place this big doesn't have two doors." She hoped that the researchers that ran the place were too preoccupied to care about their presence and that they could pass through unimpeded. There was a star map pinned to the wall that briefly caught her interest as they walked by. The Drecan military unit previously used the stars and the sun and whatnot to guide them. Nokri wasn't a navigator but had been mandatory to pick up a few things, and in the moment she thought it might serve useful now that the city was too dangerous to stay in for a while.

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

The observatory's entrance hall is larger than it should be. In front of you is grand staircase that branches into the left and right balconies. The is a door way to your right and two to the left. The wall of the lower level are either large charts or bookshelves. The center of the lower level has a massive red rug laid out on it. A table and chair set stands on the rug. 

From down the stairs an old man comes trapsing down. He has a grey beard of a sizable length and is dressed in well tailored brown robes. You can tell by how slow his hurried pace is he's long past the age of quick movements. 

"Can you two put the bar by the door in?" he says. (ooc: He assumes you do.)

He slows down a bit which makes the reason for his hurried pace apparent. He walks across the red rug and beckons you over to the table. 

"Well hello. Quite the strange way to meet. I'm Osbury Nonim, I'm watching the observatory for the owner. We're dear friends you see." He looks between the two of you. "Well. I don't expect you came in here for an interest in the stars anyway. We all have our reasons to avoid a confrontation with that lot." He says with a flick of the eyes to the door. "I must ask you, in return for shelter from their ilk you share your story. I have one of my own and frankly this is the kind of act I must take to advance it. I can promise excellent tea and buscuits, if that's any consulation." He smiles kindly enough but you can tell this isn't the joke of a man old enough to be your grandfather. He plops into one of the arm chairs around the table, placing the book that rested on it's seat in his lap. He waves in the direction of the upper left (ooc: ftr that's the south western) door; a quick glance in that direction reveals the skirts of a maid turning down the corridor. You can only assume she's off to fulfill that promise of tea and buscuits.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

Nokri's eye twitched as she noticed the old man coming downstairs, and she nudge Aldus to start walking faster. But it was too late, he called out to them and they were morally obligated to stop and acknowledge his existence. "Ooh boy. Here we go," she muttered under her breath.

“Hello,” she greeted sweetly. “My name is Nokri, pleasure to make your acquaintance, sir. Um… To be wholly honest, we are in a bit of a hurry at the moment.” She really was not one for sticking around and chit-chatting, even if they had all the time in the world. Nokri would rather tear off a fingernail than willingly share her life story with this guy, but she courteously followed him to the rest area and stood next to one of the temptingly plush chairs. *Tea and biscuits? Dang this guy is good.* Such a thought occurred when her stomach let out a betraying growl.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-20*

Aldus's eyes dart from the old man, to Nokri and back a few times not sure of this man's intent. He was expecting more of a scholarly attitude in this place, mostly full of people with their head in books, focused one thing or another - far too engaged to care about  the likes of him and Nokri. Apparently not. While his request is quite odd it's much better than being out there. 


“My name is Aldus, and thank you for your kind offer Mr. Nonim. A light snack would be greatly appreciated, although we cannot stay long I'm afraid.”

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

Osbury chuckles at Nokri's traitorous stomach. "Well, you are unfortunately stuck with a bit of a wait." he says. "The entrance we just barred is the only visitor entrance for the building. Even if I knew where any of the servant entrances were I'd be a poor housesitter if I let you wander about the private sections of the building. We can watch the courtyard and wait for those rapscallions to pass through, then I'll hold you no longer. That is the deal, else you may try your luck outside?" he finishes with a smirk into his newly arrived cup of tea. He knows which of the options is more suitable for you. 

"So tell me. Why might you be avoiding our southern *visitors*; despite your heritage?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-22*

Aldus helps himself to a seat at the table making a point that he’s taking his chances with Osbury. “My isn't story isn't all that interesting really. Came here from Wynne. As to why we are avoiding those lovely people outside, well I'll leave that explanation to my companion here. I do not know the entire story myself, only that we got into some trouble with the likes of them earlier and would not care to repeat that encounter.” Aldus's looks pointedly at Nokri, hoping she’ll give the old man some story to listen to, weather the truth or not he wouldn't know, nor care.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-23*

“If you must know… Despite my appearance, I am *not* Drecan,” Nokri firmly announced (OOC: Unreliable Expositor). She was relieved that Aldus hadn’t spouted anything unnecessary and decided upon a short story to appease this old guy as soon as possible. “I want nothing to do with those scoundrels. By Lylalel, I’m Eraian.” She paused for dramatic effect, then softened her gaze. She finally slumped into an armchair and looked at the ground. Her voice slightly shook as she continued, “I’m from a very rural farm town along the border that was destroyed years ago in the conflict. I never knew my father. I speculate he might have been Drecan, but my mother raised me all by herself while being shunned by our neighbors. We both worked so hard to survive, and when the army showed up…”

Tiny tears welled up in her ears, but she bashfully wiped them away. “I’m sorry sir. I just miss her so much. That was a horrible day. S-she… was shot down while I ran and I couldn’t do anything to save her. I don’t know why those men are after me. Perhaps they have me confused with someone else. They were yelling all sorts of nonsense.” She clenched her fist. “*Oh!!* It makes me *so* furious. May God smite them down and give them what they deserve for the atrocities they’ve committed.” Nokri gave a nod of thanks at the maid who delivered their tea and took a big gulp after the story, strongly placing the cup back on the saucer with a loud *tink* sound.

**Bill** - *2017-11-27*

The old man says nothing for a time, looking deeply into his tea. 

"That is quite the tale, clipped as it may be. I would not press you for details on such a trying event, of course." he says with watching the legs of his tea slip down the sides of the cup. "Indulge an old man a story, for I know you will appreciate it the way I do."

"I'm no astronomer, though it may be obvious. My title is that of Grand Sage, which if you are unfamiliar with the ranks spell casters use is at the top of the list." He looks up at you with a soft wink. "I find all the pomp and circumstance about it to be utter poppycock." 

"I tell you this, because my rank denotes that I take on apprentices. I've had quite the few through the years and they are like sons or daughters to me. But..." his eyes drop to his tea again. "My last apprentice was swayed by that brute Dryn Wulfa. I know not how, nor even why, but the foolish boy now serves that warlord directly. Anis is a natural with Anima magic, I can see why they want him. I already recognize his work affecting the war front." Osbury sighs. 

"It sounds terrible, I know. But I know the boy. He's logical to a fault. No matter who came to him with the argument, if it was sound logic he'd listen. I know Dryn and his men tricked Anis somehow. And now Anis is in Dreca, away from anyone who can open his foolish eyes." the old man finishes his tea and stands, walking around behind your chairs.

"Of course, this matters not to you two. I have merely held this story in far too long. I too, have lost something to Dreca. I too, have reason to bar the door at those soldier's approach." he pauses for a moment. "Soldiers which have thankfully, left my courtyard." He comes back around to face you again. 

"I shall hold you no longer, as was the agreement. Thank you for listening to my story so intently. I do ask, if you ever met someone else who feels the same way about Dreca as you and I, who might be able to reach Anis... Direct them to me. He is like a son to me; I see no better use for my resources as Grand Sage than to direct them to knocking some sense into the fool." Osbury smiles.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-29*

Aldus’s eyes open wide as Nokri tells her story, he feels tea dribble down his stubbled chin in surprise at her story and has to catch it with a napkin - so much for table manners. He’s unsure whether her story is true or not but either way Osbury seems satisfied with it. Aldus pops a biscuit in his mouth as the man tells his own tale. They have a sweet citrus flavor and he has to stop himself from shoving a few in his pouch for the road. 

Listening to the old man’s take only cements the bad impression Dreca is making oin Aldus. Being from a reasonably secluded nation he has never encountered anyone from the war hungry country he’s only heard rumors about, but it seems they live up to their reputation. He rises from his chair, anxious to be on the road again and away from all this. 

“I’m sorry to hear about your apprentice, sir. I hope that one day he sees the light and returns home to you” He says pushing his chair back in place “Thank you for the tea and biscuits - they were quite delicious!” He gives a toothy smile to the man before turning to Nokri and pointing to the door with his thumb “Shall we?”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-30*

The old man's story sent a shiver down Nokri's spine. Grand Sage? A top of the list spell caster? The horrid urge that drove Nokri to leave as soon as humanly possible began to dissipate and her interest in the old man exploded.  She recalled how she had been acting from the moment they walked in through the door until now. Did she do anything uncouth? Was she rude in any way? She couldn't recall anything horrendously offensive.

She wiped the crocodile tears from her eyes and straightened her slouch. In her peripheral vision she saw Aldus had crumbs and tea on his face. *That slob! Did he not hear whose presence we're in right now?* Granted, she didn't even know the position of Great Sage existed until just moments prior. But she sure knew now and it sure sounded impressive, so she sure wasn't going to do anything to get in his bad graces.

"What a horrible tale. I pray that your apprentice sees the error of his ways soon, and that he may return to walk beside us on the path of light once more." Nokri was intent to fully embrace her hackneyed backstory and get on this old codger's good side.

"Aldus, is the path truly clear? Should we not stay here until we're absolutely certain?" She peered out the window, not really caring what she saw but feigning to search. "Good sir, thank you ever so much for your hospitality. We are graciously in your debt," she said with a slight bow.  "I feel as though a weight has been lifted off my chest thanks to you."

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

Osbury chuckles. "And I too feel like a weight has been lifted. I leave you to your own travels young miss." He turns on his heel and walks back to the stairs. At the foot of the stairs he pauses and looks over his shoulder. 

"If you ever need a hand with anything, find my tower in the city. I'd be happy to help such fine young people." he adds. He then makes way up the stairs slowly due to his age. 

(ooc: If you want to continue with Osbury you can stop him from leaving, or leave the tower. It's open ended. The courtyard is empty as well.)

Luckily the observatory is the last detour you had to make in Theanovene. Drecians seems to avoid the northern, Callorian side of the city and it makes your trip to the north gate easy. Nokri attracts a few odd looks as you leave the north gate but no one holds you up. You trip north, making your way around the mountains with Aldus leading the way. It's a thankfully uneventful trip, you barely see let alone speak to anyone on the way to the first city on your trip, Hylley.

Hylley is a beautiful city dominated by a massive tree in the center of town. The tree's roots occasionally appear in back corners or even on side walks, creating the illusion that the entire city was built upon it's root system. The buildings are made of a white stone that must be plentiful in the area, and while there are less buildings that one would expect in a capital they make up for it most buildings being multistory. The open space is often filled with manicured grassy lots, adding to the overall appeal of the city. The overall appearance is that of place where nature is prominent and respected. 

As if it's beauty was not enough, Hylley also welcomes you with the preparations for a festival in place. The large park around the central tree is buzzing with men putting together wooden structures, the overwhelmingly delicious smell of baked goods, and children being yelled at for being under foot. The banners that are being raised show images of a mountain, a waterfall from that mountain, and a familiar looking tree. Everyone working is full of smiles and laughing the day away. Whatever event is taking place, it's very popular.

Travellers that you are, you can quickly make your way to the northwest gate to continue on your journey. However upon arriving at the northern gate, you can see it's gates are barred closed. A guardsman sits in front of them on a chair he must have pulled from the guardhouse, playing with a child's toy ball and cup.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

Aldus is ready for a break by the time they reach Hylley. At this point he’s not even sure he remembers what an actual bed feels like after having traveled the half the continent without resting in one. Fatigue aside, Hylley is a small wonder in itself. He thinks to suggest stopping  - especially when he smells all the delicious scents coming from the festival food - but bites his tongue and continues on. 

Aldus has to do a double take at the guardsmen to make sure that he is indeed on duty and not just a man taking a rest in a peculiar spot. Best to try an make a good impression anyway he thinks, trying to learn something from his previous encounter and subsequent scolding from Nokri. Hmmm… Nokri - best she stays here to avoid any unwanted questions. Turning around, he faces her 

“I’m going to ask why the gates are closed, but I think maybe you should stay hidden at least until I figure out what's up” he says to her. 

 He stops next to the window of a seeming unoccupied building and looks at his reflection in the glass. He stands taller, straightens his pack on his shoulder, straightens out his hair, and puts on a winning smile - making sure to check his teeth. He nods at himself approvingly in the window and walks over to the boredom stricken man. 

“Good day sir! I’ve just arrived in town,regretfully though I cannot stay long. Would you be able to tell me why the gates are closed?”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

This new town was neat and welcoming. Almost too neat and welcoming, and Nokri repeatedly swiveled her head around suspiciously to take in the sights just as she had while on the road. Her eyes lingered on food stands with the strongest scents wafting from them, her mind on the same page as Aldus's for the first time ever, though she didn't let it show. With how smoothly they were progressing, Nokri's mood magically seemed to lift a bit, and she even had the hint of a genuine smile on her face due to the lively festival atmosphere.

But then of course the gate was closed and being guarded. The sourness returned to her face. Walking through a town couldn't be so simple, *something* had to impede them. She had half a mind of going up to the guard and yanking the toy of his hand.  Before she did though Aldus stopped her. Nokri nodded at his words and instead plopped down on the ground to wait. After settling down on the side of the road somewhere relatively tidy and dirtless, she looked up and snickered at how he spiffed himself up in the window. It would've been funnier if there were people inside watching.

Suddenly figuring this would be as good a time as any, Nokri stood up again ran over to a stall. They were getting ready for the festival and popping some kind of butter-coated kernels over heat. "Could I please get two servings of this?" she inquired, taking out some change she brought from Theanovene. One was for her and one was, kindly, for Aldus. As long as he hurried and returned before Nokri had the chance to finish hers and start eating his portion.

**Bill** - *2017-12-07*

The guard looks up at you and smiles brightly before rising to his feet while brushing off his lap of the dust from the road. 

"Good Afternoon! I can tell you that, and because you asked I can tell you've never been at the Hylley festival before have you?" he says retorically. "The gates are closed because the river beyond is about to become a rapid for the evening." he says with a knowing smile of a story teller. 

"Every year just before the winter season a massive flow of water pours from the river's source in the western mountains. It floods dangerously ahead of the city and is far too dangerous for travelers. At the city limits it's calmed enough that it fills the natural canals you might have seen walking through to the gate and flows brillantly through the whole city. The whole event lasts but an evening and we hold the festival to celebrate it. Especially since it's the reason Hyll Tree stands as tall as it does." he says with the ease of someone whose explained the story before. 

"The story of the festival aside; we don't allow anyone to travel out of the city into the rapids. You'll have to stay the night in town. There's plenty of inn space, don't you worry. Not to mention you should really be staying for the festival itself!" he adds. "Now, unless you have any questions for me, I'll leave you to it." he says before plopping back into his chair.

(ooc: Unless you do have more questions for him, you can discuss in aside or just move into the festival area. Give me an idea of where your going and I'll run from there monday.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-08*

“Oh, ummm thank you” he replies, feeling a little silly for thinking there would be more trouble afoot than this. 

He turns around and heads back to where Nokri is standing and eating some kind of good smelling little puffs that he assumes are from one of the vendors nearby. He drags his eyes up from the food to her face. 

“So the gate guard said that all of this is a festival in celebration of the fact that one day a year the source of the river releases a massive amount of water, flooding the area around town. That’s also why the gate is closed today, but it will re-open tomorrow.” He takes a breath “He suggested we enjoy the festival tonight and find an inn to stay in. Not a bad idea - It might be nice to sleep in a real bed again.” smiling wistfully at the thought.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-11*

"What's the word?" she asked as their conversation wrapped up and Aldus came back. Seeing as she was only half done hers, she somewhat reluctantly offered the second goodie bag to him.

"Did you ask the guard where the inns are?" Looking around, there was no shortage of people who could probably give them directions, but Nokri didn't much feel like going around and asking questions like the obvious tourists they were. "Whatever. We'll find one regardless. S'long as it's cheap."

She started walking down the street, still munching and looking at the various shops and signs that could point them in the right direction. "I want to find someplace with vacancy before all the rooms are booked up. Let's go."

**Bill** - *2017-12-11*

You start to get a lay of the land at the festival as you look for an inn. The massive tree in the center of town is surrounded by a wide, circular park where the festival at large is taking place. People mill about, walking in a literal circle as the activities and merriment changes. 

True to the man's word, finding an inn is easy in the festival. You quickly find one surrounded by mistrals and street preformers with a vacancy at a very good price. Given it's almost central location there's naught a reason to refuse lodging. Between the view, the smell of the food, and the cozy decor you really lucked out. After being given a key for your room upstairs, you're assured there will be hot water available for a bath. If that didn't float your boat, when you open the door to your room you can see the massive plush beds. The comforts of home be damned, a bed like that is what the gods sleep on.

As you step into your room, you can hear pounding from outside and down the hall. Peering out your door, no other door is open in the hall. From around the bend at one end of the hallway comes a young man with a Lute in one hand, sprinting from a much larger looking man dressed in black. The term that comes to mind is Gorilla, though calling him such would probably anger him even further. From up the staircase on the other end of the hall a second man in black comes charging up, taking a wide stance at the top of the stairs and blocking it off. 

(ooc: welcome to the festival <@!288513265661902858> )

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-14*

Aldus turns around, surprised and taken aback at the scene that as suddenly unfolded in the hall. He has half a mind to simple shut the door, lay down and sleep - effectively ignoring whoever this man and his pursuers maybe be. He stands in the doorway with Nokri next to him. He looks down to see if he can gauge her reaction to the situation, and to see weather or not she wants to get involved in whatever this conflict between the big men and the lute player may be.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

Dashing down the hall Eliran cursed himself, _Of course you had to pick a fight with the big baddie in the town during the one time of year you can't leave it_. Looking towards the stairs ahead he realizes his exit has been cut off by Gorilla Grunt A. Glancing around, he looked for an open room, preferably one with a window to escape through, when  pair of heads suddenly popped out! Realizing that his only chance of escape was the pair of strangers ahead,  Eliran cried out to them in his most panick stricken voice, "Help! They're trying to kill me!" As he sprinted towards the two strangers room, Eliran hoped that his cry for help was enough to convince them.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-14*

Nokri's face is, as usual, stoic and unimpressed. She was interested in the events taking place in the hallway, but it wasn't her problem and she didn't care enough to get involved. "What do you think he did?" she mused, wondering how such a chase began. Maybe he stole something, or he was so bad at playing that lute he insulted some noble.

She was right about to turn back into the room for some peace and quiet when things turns for the worst. The man being pursued noticed the two of them being nosy, and of course started heading their way.  "Shut the door, *shut the door*!" Nokri tried to grab Aldus and push him in and slam the door shut, but with how little distance there was between them and the stairs, there wasn't enough time to fully close and lock the door before the panicked stranger reached them.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-14*

Seeing that the two strangers were trying to avoid the situation altogether, Eliran cradled his lute and made a leap towards the slightly ajar door. As he crashed into the room with all the grace of a walrus launched on a catapult, Eliran wondered why his day always seemed to end with him crashing into a new problem.

**Bill** - *2017-12-14*

Despite the lute player's wild dive knocking Nokri and Aldus both back into the room in a tumble, the door does manage to swing close with a click. Not a moment too soon, as cannonball sized fists start banging on the door. If you squint, it almost looks like the door is bending inward with every hit. 

"Get back here you rat! Don't think we can't get through a measly door!" comes bellowing from the hallway.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-17*

Groaning Eliran rolled off of whoever he crashed into and sat up, _Note to self, don't dive into closing doors_. Looking at the two, probably bewildered stangers, Eliran couldn't help but let out a little sass, "wow thanks for the help dear strangers." he remarked. Not waiting for their response, Eliran starts to try and push a dresser in front of the door as a way to barricade it. Clearly struggling, he appeals towards Aldus, "Sorry but could you please help me move this? These guys are the type to maim or kill first, and ask questions later."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

"What the *[censored]*" Nokri muttered. The small bout of action bumped her shoulder into the wall, the one still healing thanks to those lovely Drecan soldiers in Theanovene, and she bitterly rubbed it. "And who in the world are *you*?" she asked. Turning to Aldus with slight suspicion, she asked "you don't know him. Do you?" Nokri had half a mind to open the door and throw him back out into the hallway before the door inevitably came crashing down. Any repair fees would be going on their hotel bill and she was not going to stand for that. Back to the stranger who had impressively managed to roll himself into the room, she said "you better start explaining fast."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

After their strange and breif conversation, Aldus helps Eliran into the armoire. "You'd better hope this works lute boy" he says as he firmly closes the door and steps back to where Nokri is. He puts on his best surprised face and braces himself for whatevers coming next.

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

Not even a minute after Eliran tucks himself into the armoire the dresser that had been your sole safeguard falls forward. Over the top climb not just Brickface and Meatslab but more men dressed similiarly. 

"If you two know what's best for you, tell us where the rat went. We don't mean you any harm, despite our entrance." Brickface says. He doesn't smile, but it does seem he's trying to reassure you. 

"To hell with it Orar. They've got to be allies of his, why else would they let him into their room?" Meatslab says to his compatriot. 

"He could have just barged into an open door Lac." Orar says with an aside glance. 

"And if they are his allies? The boss will be furious. I'm not going to take that risk." Lac adds decisively. He motions with a hand and the other men filter around the outside of the room. "We're going to need you to come with us. If the rat is still listening, know that if anything happens to these two it's your fault." 

Orar almost looks to argue, but shrugs and motions for Aldus and Nokri to head to the door. 

(ooc: It's up to you what you want to do. In particular, don't feel like fighting isn't a option because they have more people, all the nameless men are just mooks.)

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-20*

By the time the door burst open and their new guests came stomping in, Nokri had already switched to being a damsel in distress, sitting uselessly on the corner of a bed. She shrieked and covered her face with a pillow. "T-the window!" she squeaked, pointing to the wide open window and billowing curtains. "He fell from there and r-ran west, or down the street that way." (ooc: unreliable expositor)

"You men are after him, right? That guy threatened us, what an awful man. Please find him. He can't be left to terrorize the town." She hugged the pillow, shaking like a leaf. After all the walking they had done to get here, Nokri really didn't feel like leaving the room and just wanted a break. She feigned an attempt to stand up and move to the door as they ordered, but only rose a couple inches from the bed before falling down again. "I c-can't move my legs..." she whispered, as though the fear was too strong and the shock of the whole ordeal was too much to handle.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-20*

Putting a believable shake in his voice he cowers slightly and says to the men “Please, sirs we want nothing to do with whoever that mad man was. My fiance and I are here celebrating our engagement, we want nothing more than to enjoy the festival with rest of the good people of Hylley and make memories. We just arrived here when that man crashed into us, said some things I’d rather not repeat and proceeded to escape out the window and run off. Detaining us would only waste time you could be looking for him”

 He walks over to where Nokri is sitting on the bed and puts his arms around her in false comfort giving a gentle squeeze. *she’s going to kill me for this later* he thinks “Now please, this has given us quite the shock and my beloved is very faint of heart” he says to the men before turning to her “It’s ok honey, he’s gone now, everything's gonna be ok, I’m here”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

_These people are way to good for me_ Eliran thought, hiding out in his armoire. He had doubted that the two would stick to their end of the deal after being threatened with being taken just because they happened to be in the room. Still, the issue had yet to resolve itself, so he sat poised with his small blade, ready to jump out of the armoire and stab whichever Meatslab is closest.

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Despite the rather over the top reaction to their intrusion, Orar looks to Lac. "Do we really bother taking them with us? We can find him without these two and they really don't sound involved..." he says with a glance at Aldus and Nokri. Lac only snorts.

"Did you really get into organized crime thinking you'd never inconvenience someone Orar?" Lac says. "I told you I ain't taking the risk they are involved and are trying to play us." he turns specifically to Aldus and Nokri. "And that goes double for you, I don't really care what your story is you're coming with us. Boys?"

At his command the rest of the men in the room approach the two of them. Lac himself walks up and pulls Nokri up, throwing her over his shoulder. Surprsingly, he does delicately, making sure she wouldn't have to support her own weight in the transition. The other men motion of Aldus to come along after Lac, while Orar simple shakes his head with a hand over his face.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-23*

_Well shit, now I've gotten them involved..._  Eliran thought, wondering what he should do. If they just go with them and continue to play along, the two strangers might be able to get off scott free, or they could give away his position to escape now. Still...  knowing the gangs reputation he couldn't help but assume the worse would happen to them, even if Orar seems like a bro.  Sighing to himself, he knew what he to do. Looking through a crack in the armoire door, Eliran picked his target, the nearest Mook, and burst out of the closet, attacking him with the short blade, aiming to kill with a slash to the mans throat.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-24*

Nokri stiffened when Aldus came over, but bore it through gritted teeth. “Thanks, dear,” she said, doing her best to sound sincere and hating every moment of it. Aldus could get an earful about this later, once their guests finally left. Much to her disappointment though they didn’t go away. 

Hearing their new decision to take them along, Nokri pouted, and the moment she was picked up she decided to spill the beans. She rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to tell the two hooligans that their target was in the closet. Before she could finish getting a word out though, the closet’s occupant burst out with guns blazing. “*Hey!* Watch it!” Nokri had had enough of violence and was none too keen of being even more injured.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-25*

Seeing these brutes man handle Nokri so disrespectfully makes one corner of  his mouth twitch up in disgust.

“Well, can't say we didn't try” he says with a shrug as Eliran springs out of the armoire. He drops his bow off his shoulder and into his left hand while simultaneously plucking an arrow from his quiver and notching it faster than either the brutes or their lackeys can react. He fires an arrow into the wall just above Lac’s head and then steps forward and kicks out with his left foot into Lac’s shin in an effort to make him lose his grasp on Nokri long enough to pull her back behind him. 

He chuckles at the cracked plaster on the wall, thinking how Nokri can add that to the list of things to yell at him for later, when they're done with this.

**Bill** - *2017-12-26*

Lac ducks his head quickly to dodge the arrow fired by Aldus, leaving him wide open for a kick to the shin. He yowls and hops backward on his good leg. Nokri is unceremoniously dropped on the floor face first. Lac slams his foot back down and growls. He sticks his hands in his pockets and they come out adorned with brass knuckles. He steps over Nokri towards Aldus jabbing low into Aldus's stomach before whirling into a haymaker aimed at Aldus's cheek. 

Orar sighs at the start of combat but takes a boxer's ready pose. He steps towards Eliran and the man he just dropped. He makes two jabs which fall short of hitting Eliran which serve a dual purpose of getting within grabbing range. Orar wraps one his arms around Eliran's, twisting the smaller man around. Eliran can feel a steel gauntlet under Orar's sleeve as Orar holds Eliran tight to his chest. 

"I've got our guy, let's just leave!" Orar says over the sounds of fighting.

"To hell with that!" Lac replies.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

A busted door, a broken wall, a scratched up floor. The hotel owners were going to *love* them. Nokri could feel the money she had saved up flying out of her purse and into the great beyond. Seething with rage, she tried to take advantage of the situation and kick her assailant to get free after he lost his balance. She underestimated just how off-balance he was though. Unprepared for a sudden descent, Nokri fell straight down, unceremoniously hitting the ground like a ragdoll. Luckily enough, her face also caught the side of the bedpost, and she smacked the side of her head hard against the wood with a *thwap*. Some choice words ran through her mind, but her consciousness faded before being able to spit anything out, and she could only hope some thug didn't fall and crush her from there on out. *Eh, Aldus'll be able to take care of them anyway. Probably.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

A flash of pain radiates from his abdomen, his eyes whince shut in reaction just before a hard and fast punch hits him square in the jaw. His head swoons and the taste of blood fills his mouth. He spits onto the floor and rotates back to face Lac gritting his pointed teeth and growling, his toned arms tighten and his left fist clenches tighter around his bow.

He punches out fast into the side of Lac’s face with his bow, using the pointed metal knocks on the outside to stab into his face and throw him off balance. Then pulls an arrow out with his right hand and, using it like a dagger stabs into Lac’s right wrist in an attempt to make Lac drop one of his weapons. He tears the arrow back out and knocks it in its rightful place, simultaneously hooking  his left foot behind Lac’s right leg, tripping him. 

It’s then that he notices a very still Nokri on the floor next to the bedpost, A trail of blood stemming from her forehead. “Oh no” he says in an undertone, despite her overall attitude toward him he couldn't help feeling somewhat drawn to the small angry woman. “You bastard!” he exclaims with a new found strength, he half-steps backward and fires an arrow into Lac’s other foot, while staring directly and coldly into his eyes. Despite the close range and not even looking at his target he does not miss.

He takes a deep breath, eyes going wide for a moment while he steals himself. He reaches down and swiftly moves Nokri unto the bed and then lands his eyes on the body sprawled out near... *Cantaret... Is that what he said his surname was?* The body isn’t moving, but Aldus tries not to think about that right now, *deal with that later* he tells himself *at least it was quick?*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-28*

"Rude" Eliran says, half to himself and half to Orar, as he gets pulled into an arm lock. Feeling the steel gauntlet on his back Eliran comments to Orar, "You seem nice so I _really_ don't want to hurt you.." _but your boss is a murderous asshole that disrespects women_ he thought to himself.  Breaking free of the mans grasps, Eliran immediately drops low and stabs him in the inner thigh, _this should at least immobalize him_ and then goes to sweep him, forcing Orar to the ground. hopping back a few steps to gage the room, Eliran leaves Orar helpless on the ground,.

Noticing Nokri's now limp body, he is filled with dread, _this is my fault_ he thought to himself. Why did he have to get these two involved in his Problem? _Stupid Stupid Stupid_. He thought. Looking at the remaining mooks, he set himself poised to fight, now next to Aldus, who he noticed looking at the now dead mook from before, "Sorry" Eliran said almost absentmindedly to the mook. He didn't like to kill, but he knew this wouldn't end anytime soon without some blood being spilt.

**Bill** - *2017-12-28*

"I'm not that much of a push over boy." Orar says from behind Eliran as the bard approaches Aldus. Orar no longer looks uncomfortable with the goings on as he spins the minstral around with a pull on on of his arms. Orar snaps out with a one two punch upside the head and then steps in with a dropped shoulder, shoving his elbow into Eliran's gut and his shoulder into his nose. It launches Eliran back a few paces into some of the other men in the room, leaving the lot of you in a pile. Orar steps to the side, putting himself between you and the other fighters.

Lac rubs his wrist with his uninjured arm, leaning heavily on his good leg. "What the literal hell..." The brute of a man mutters. He jumps forward behind Aldus as the wolf laguz moves his unconscious friend under the bed. Lac grabs the back of Aldus's head with his massive hand and throws the wolf laguz into the wall with a crash. He then pivots on one foot, reaching down to grasp Aldus's face. Using the wall to help support Aldus, Lac lifts the wolf to his feet with that single hand.

Lac's other fist pounds into Aldus's chest. "The. Hell. Is. Wrong. With. You!" the enforcer says through grit teeth. "Do you see me with a blade? Are you trying to kill me?"

"We. Are. Civil. lized. People!" Lac yells, each word punctuated with another punch. The enraged man then drops Aldus's face and kicks the laguz away. Lac then steps away slowly to support Orar.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

“Trying to...no of course not I just-” Hes cut short by Lac throwing his full weight into the wall, smacking him directly in the nose, as he falls back he notices a splotch of his blood on the plaster. Then he’s up, and turned around and Lacs ugly and equally as bloodied face is in his, breathing stale fish smell into his sensitive nostrils, making his stomach lurch. Then comes a series of blows to his hardened leather chest plate, but each one is harder than the last and by the fourth his he feels a pop somewhere deep in his chest. The fifth has his consciousness wavering greatly. Then Lac unceremoniously kicks him to the side. Aldus lands on his stomach *Now, who’s trying to kill who again?* he thinks, uneasily pushing himself up with his arms as Lac turns his back on him, toward Eliran. *you have to stop getting yourself involved in everyone else’s problems* he remembers his mother saying to him once, well it appears she was right. He should have kicked this bard, or actor, or whatever he was back out into the halway. *Too late now*

Unstably getting himself to his feet, he fully realises how much trouble they are going to be in. There’s no way this encounter hasn’t been loud and obnoxious, and  giving its late evening there is no doubt someone is probably complaining to the innkeeper right now. He also realises that Lac probably assumes he’s passed out harmlessly in the corner he was kicked into given the fact that not only his but Orar’s and the remaining lackey’s attention are all focused on Eliran at the moment. 

He *could* just grab Nokri and jump out the window, leaving the man to his fate. But he won’t, whoever he is surely he had no intentions of this happening, and seems a halfway honorable sort at least seeing he didn't just simply let the two of them get slaughtered on his behalf without trying to help. He looks fit enough to be able to make the leap from the second floor window as well.

Aldus hopes his adrenaline will distract him enough from the pain in his chest, and face…and stomach. Trying not to think about how much this is going to hurt later Aldus slings Nokri up over one shoulder and slings his bow over the other. He attempts to get Eliran’s attention by waving his hand. He points to himself, then the window on his own side of the room. Then points to Eliran and the window on the adjacent side of the bed, closer to Eliran. 

He sits and carefully moves himself through the window being extra careful not to hurt Nokri, takes one last look over at Eliran, hoping he will follow and pushes himself off the sill and falls down to the ground. He tries to absorb the shock by bending his knees when they hit the ground but a flash of pain emanating from *everywhere* causes him to lose balance and fall backward onto his butt instead. Still most of fall was broken and he regains his balance, pulls Nokri into the nearest alleyway and holds her wrist, making sure there’s a still a solid pulse. Then he holds his breath and prays to his stupid ancestors that this works out.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-01*

Being spun around Eliran takes a one two punch upside the head and then gets hit with a dropped shoulder.As he is launched Eliran's elbows happen to hit two of the mooks behind him in the temple, instantly knocking them out on accident, this leads to a chain reaction of falling, that also knocks the rest of the mooks behind them, with Eliran being the only one left awake and capable, although somewhat dazed and surprised by his apparent reign of terror. 

Standing up, Eliran. notices a signal from Aldus, who seems to be faking unconsciousness, while planning to pick up unconscious chicks and hop out a window. Talk about a walk of shame. Making note of this plan, Eliran calls out towards the still open door, "Officer, these gang members are trying to kill us!" as a distraction, then he takes to the open window and ollies the fuck out, hopping outside, and running over to meet the Aldus out there.

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Orar's jaw drops as Aldus drops from the window. Lac, who was facing Orar rather than Aldus's corner of the room, turns and shouts. 

"Are you people insane?!" He clomps over to the window and looks over the side, frantically searching for where you ended up. In Aldus's escape both of the men miss Eliran's exit until it's too late to stop the mistral. As Eliran get his last look of the room he can see Orar running for the door with Lac has his eyes locked on the bard.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

"Ok lets go," Eliran said, seeing that Aldus had the Nokri in hand once again, "The inn is a bit far but we shouldn't have any problems getting there." He said, leading the way. Using his knowledge of the streets and the large crowds that were still moving around thanks to the festival, Eliran slowly walked Aldus and Nokri, to the inn that he had originally planned on staying in, which was a little farther from the festivities and towards the towns northern entrance. The innkeeper was one he had deals with before, and he knew was trustworthy, so even if the goons did come a knocking, the group should get some form of warning before their escape was cut off.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

Aldus repostions his bow on his back and picks up Nokri bridal style, she still hasn't moved but her breathing is steady so Aldus pushes concern for her out of him mind till he can find a place to lay her down. Eliran has offered him a room and to find a healer *I could really use one* he thinks, the pain in his rib becoming sharp with the weight of Nokri in his arms. 

“Lead the way, Eliran” He says, hoping there will be a healer available for them and also that his gut feeling on Eliran is accurate and he’s not leading him to some sort of set up or trap. He pushes the thought from his head.

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

You make your way through the crowded streets of the desk festival. Everything is lit up by torch and fire light and people run around gaily. With Nokri in Aldus's arms they assume the little girl simply wore herself out with the festivities. Twice you encounter men dressed in the same fashion as the ones you escaped from but are able to turn a different way to avoid them. They're still actively searching for you from the looks of it, though you have yet to spot Orar and Lac again. 

Your most recent turn brought you into the festival square. The massive tree in the center has floating paper lanterns all about it with lights inside them. They're beautiful and accent the warm light coming from below. It unusual just how many fires are lit through the festival, while every one is well contained and maintained, half the fires would light the city. 

Your destination is completely across the fairgrounds, with you entering from the western side of the festival and the inn in question is through the southeastern exit. In your path is rows of festival stalls, a large circle of people around a dancing troupe, and some large tents.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Aldus takes a second to marvel at the dancers and other festivities occurring through the square, he desperately wishes he could participate in the fun but that is decidedly not an option at this point. 

Despite the ambiance and energy created by the festival and lights Aldus presses forward following Eliran to the inn that he can only hope will provide the reprieve he so desperately needs right now. The pain in his rib stabs at him violently with each step and is only made worse by the weight of Nokri lying limply in his arms. He grits his pointed teeth through the pain and continues onward weaving through the crowd.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-08*

Reaching the square, Eliran gave an impressed whistle, looking back to Aldus' face of wonderment  "It really is amazing isn't it? I come to this festival whenever I can, and it still stuns me every time." He said before facing forward and stepping into the festival area, planning on going through the crowded area to get as close to the inn as possible with the purpose of blending into the crowd. As he continued to lead Aldus, Eliran thought back to the kerfuffle where he met the bowman and the girl. ".....I'm really sorry you won't be able to enjoy it because of this mess" he said. 

As he felt his expression sadden, Eliran made sure to keep his back to them, not wanting to ruin what little of the festival they'd be able to see now that he got them involved.  _I killed a man_ he thought to himself, feeling a heavy weight on his shoulders. It wasn't the first time Eliran had killed, it was part of his growing up fending for himself after he left his home, but that didn't make the guilt that came with the killing any smaller. Thinking back on it, he knew he could have probably incapacitated the man without killing him, but with the number and the threat to the two behind him, Eliran hoped the act would make the gang members think twice before continuing their chase, that the cost outweighed the benefit of grabbing one measily bard. Thinking about it now, the choice probably had the complete opposite affect.  _Stupid stupid stupid_ he told himself as he mentally hit himself in the head. Shaking his  head, he focused on looking less like somebody who had just killed a man and more like a festival goer, and looked back to Aldus again, "This way," Eliran said as he made a turn, "we should be there soon."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-10*

It was warm and comfortable. Nokri felt like a little kid, safe at home after dozing off on a lazy summer afternoon. It felt more peaceful and relaxing in that moment than it had been for a very long time. She tilted her head, rubbing it onto whatever it was leaned against, which in her dazed state she thought to be a pillow. But something felt off, and it started nagging in the back of her head. This was not her pillow. And what were those sounds? It was silent just a second ago.

Reality hit her like a sack of bricks and she jolted to her senses, waking up and practically falling out of Aldus's arms. "Wh... huh?" Nokri's memory was hazy and she had absolutely no idea what was going on. Aldus was recognizable, but who was this other punk? She tried to stand, struggling away from Aldus and to her feet as the world spun and her ears screeched. 

"Somebody tell me what is happening. Now." Her natural Drecan accent slipped out in full force, but other matters were more pressing at the moment. Memories were slowing starting to come back. The inn, and the punk who randomly showed up while being chased and dragged them into it. *Was I hit?* The festival lighting and loud atmosphere only served to further disorient Nokri, who was experiencing something akin to the world's worst hangover that affected her entire body. She glared at the boys while waiting for her double vision to return to normal, noticing they weren't exactly in tip-top condition either compared to the lively festivalgoers around them. *Oh great. We're on the run, aren't we. Uugh.* She wiped her face with a sleeve, taking note of the dried blood from a previous nosebleed. "This is just great."

**Bill** - *2018-01-11*

The stall keepers wave to you and the dancers try to invite you in but you walk past them and they don't press you. Soon only the row of tents stands between you and the Inn, yet it never seems to be that easy. You can see walking with purpose through the crowd behind you and the row ahead of you more men dressed like those who've been following you all this time. At the back you see Lac, and the front you see Orar, and to your sides are massive tent flaps. It's not an easy spot to be in, though there's a slight corner in the connecting tents on the right that you duck into for at least a moment's worth of cover. There's a flap that leads into one of the tents, the tent the big top for a circus, three rings adorning the floor of the tent and stands all around the outside. The corner is formed by the connecting tunnel to other tent. Some circus personnel mill about inside. 

(ooc: There are many ways around a problem outside of conflict. Your group is decidedly better at them that light cannon, i like swords, and sir trips alot so have at thee. I've set the parts of the scene that are important, the tent, the dancers, the stalls, and the inn beyond the circus. You have the freedom to move about in them and explore so have it. You can use asides for in character planning and #occ to discuss, this is a collaborative story so collaborate.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-15*

_shit_ Looking around Eliran found the answer to their new problem. Seeing a nearby unattended stall with festival masks, he knew what they had to do. 
"I've got an idea," he said, quickly grabbing three masks and passing two to Nokri and Aldus "quick put these on."

~~Eliran then proceeded to take a massive shit on the whole city~~

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

*What moron just leaves their stall unattended?* Nokri grudgingly took the mask handed to her, only realizing what it was for when she looked up. Rolling her eyes, she strolled over to the empty mask store and said to her companions "I recommend you two get over here, now." There was probably enough empty storage space where they could hide without being kicked *too* much.

The neighboring shopkeeps were luckily busy with customers for the moment, but they'd surely be confused when they noticed the mask seller suddenly transformed into someone else. Nokri lackadaisically put on the ridiculous smiling mask, wishing the thugs would pass by and this would all be over soon. Head still pounding, she undid her braids in hopes it would simultaneously ease the headache and make recognition more difficult. Instead, the wavy hair just blew about in the wind and obscured her vision more than the mask did, getting into her eyes. *I'm too fed up to deal with this right now.*

There was a heavy cash box Nokri eyed up behind the table, but it was solidly locked, and trying to unlock it now would just cause more unwarranted attention. "Tch."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

Adus inhales sharply as he spots Lac and Orar closing in on them. A few half baked escape plans run through his head but before he can fully form an idea Eliran pulls him and Nokri into an unoccupied mask vendors stall. Aldus takes the masks thrust into his hands and turns it over to look at the front, the face of a wolf stares back at - *ha how ironic* he thinks dryly. 

Nokri instructs him to hide underneath the stall. “Why should I hide underneath the stall, and wear a mask” he says, donning the mask and pulling up his hood, making sure to tuck his easily notable gray-white hair underneath. “I think I have a better idea” he says grabbing a stray apron from a storage box and putting it on, he walks around to the outside of the stall. Joining the din of other festival vendors he begins calling out to passerbys trying to sell them his newly acquired wares. “Masks! Get masks here! Join the festivities! Become whoever you want!”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-15*

Eliran grins underneath his fox mask, also notices the heavy cash box, _I could probably get that_ he thought to himself casually, not really with any  intention to steal, but more a self-assestment and appreciation for his own skills. Seeing Aldus's actions, he joins in calling people to the booth to buy the items.

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*

Lac and Orar's groups come to meet not a stall over from you. The veritable horde of men block the path way for the rest of the fair goers with their numbers milling about. You can hear the two men discussing. 

"Damnit. I thought I saw a dog over here." Lac says with an angry click of his tongue. Orar nods in response, head on a swivel looking over the festival area. "Boss isn't going to be happy we lost the guy." Lac continues. "Think having that woman will keep our heads from rolling?"

"Boss can deal with her himself, their already at the festival overlook. We just do our job." Orar finally replies. His gaze lingers on the wolf masked salesman a stall over. Lac starts saying something else but is quieted by a raised hand from Orar. Orar walks up to the mask stall.

"Excuse me. Have you sold any of those masks to a young trio?" He asks in a polite voice but doesn't both putting on a smile. "A wolf laguz boy, likely carrying a short girl of Drecian descent, and a second boy with a minstrel's lute? They'd be about your age." Lac looks on from the center of the area with a half interested expression.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

These idiots. They were going to get them discovered  faster than a barefoot jackrabbit on a hot greasy griddle in the middle of August, shouting in the middle of the street like that. Nokri would have liked to sink under the table herself, but unfortunately they started attracting customers. Very unwanted customers.

She watched from the jagged, mostly obscured corner of her eye, hoping they wouldn't mess this up. Meanwhile, any customers that approached her would be told the masks were a random, evenly numbered price in the hopes they'd pay up and Nokri could pocket the profits.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-17*

Eliran paused after hearing the inquiry, as if he was honestly considering it, "I don't recall seeing a wolf laguz, but...." he scratched the side of his head, "There _was_ a young minstral here not to long ago that bought three masks." he offered. Eliran hoped this ploy would work better than the last, and that by the end of it he could send the thugs the wrong the direction.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

He swallows hard as Lac and Orar walk into the area, he can just make out what they're saying as they near them. 

"Think having that woman will keep our heads from rolling?" he hears the one who royally messed him up say, his rib twinges at the memory *What woman? Who could they be talking about?*  He’ll have to see if Eliran can give him any insight into that later.
 
For a minute he thinks the two brutes will pass their stall by without a second glance, as they’ve done with the others they have passed. It appears they will have no such luck.  Eliran speaks before Aluds has a chance to react to the large man’s question, giving him a moment to steal himself. 

He takes a breath, and says in an upbeat tone “Ah yes, quite the garish fellow that one. Couldn't forget him if I tried. Seemed to be in a rush, I believe he went off that way”. Aldus points off in a direction that is neither where they came from nor where they are going.

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Orar looks over the two masked salesman slowly. His eyes narrow at the one in the fox mask. Despite the noise and bustle of the festival his silence is noticeable and it seems to go on for hours. Orar looks behind the two of them to the girl behind the counter and his brow furrows. 

"Orar?" Lac says, having stepped up next to the man. "You aren't shopping right now are you?" Orar only responds with another raised hand as he looks from masked face to masked face. Lac taps his foot before scoffing.

"I'm not waiting around Orar. They're getting further away the longer we stand here. If you stare long enough maybe you can convince yourself that fox" Lac points with a thumb at Eliran, "is the rat." Lac says as he turns on his heel and starts off towards the circle of dancers and onlookers. He points his men in various directions and the assembled people scatter the festival in smaller groups. 

Orar takes one last look at the wolf masked salesman before he grunts out a "Thanks." and stalks off.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

Aldus let's out a releived sigh as soon as the two are far enough away, and visibly relaxes. Electing to leave the mask on for now, he turns to the other two. "I'd say we should be on way to the inn before the actual owner of this stall returns.... or worse" he says leaving a few coins on the counter in exchange for the mask.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-22*

"Mmhmm." Nokri doesn't bother to pick up the coins Aldus left, but she does take the few she made from mask sales. She considered it payment for her five or so minutes of labor.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-22*

"It was a good performance" Eliran didn't touch the coins that Aldus left, nor did he add to the pile. Instead, he flipped his fox mask with that of a coyote. "This way" he said, continuing to lead the two, making sure to avoid the direction Orar and Lac went specifically while still heading towards the inn. 
As he lead the way, Eliran thought back to the two men's conversation, worried about the woman who was the object of their boss' desires. _you can't get there two any more involved in your problems. Take care of them first_ He thought, glancing back towards Aldus and Nokri

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

The split up men are much easier to avoid, ironically enough. You can get around them easily and with your masks you almost don't have to avoid them at all. The inn is, as Eliran promised, just beyond the circus tent. You work your way through through the packed line of people waiting to enter the big top and leave the fairgrounds unimpeded. 

The inn is... less reputable than the one you arrived at before. It's location is definitely it's primary draw, with balconies overlooking the fair ground off the second floor rooms. The rest of the building is historic, or at least that's how the sign post describes it. 

```
       The Cheerful Sparrow
Historic Inn on the Festival Grounds
```

The tavern is filled with drunken revelers enjoying their evening. The bartender is a young woman, blonde with a red bandanna over in her hair. She's pouring some of what must be the house wine for one customer while arguing with another rowdy one. As you approach her for a room key, she gives you a quick smile and turns back to her argument.

"You're drunk Tal, I'm not serving you any more." she says with a roll of her eyes. She finishes off the wine bottle to half fill the glass in front of her.

"Seee...Serraaaaa! Iiii'mmmm finu!" the drunk insists jovially. "Du...n... be akull jaooy." 

"Yes Tal, I'm a killjoy, it's in the job description. Go home." She says with a wry grin and an aside look. She uncorks a new bottle and resumes pouring.

"AH'lllll Ha-ta buring ya sem jaooy den!" the drunk slurs and he reaches over the bar with a lecherous look on his face. 

He quickly finds a bottle slammed onto his hand, Serra rolling her eyes again. As he cradles his hand in his chest, she leans over the bar herself and flicks him in the forehead. The barstool topples over and deposits it's occupant on the floor, much to the amusement of the bar as a whole. 

"Someone drag him home will you?" Serra calls to the room at large as she serves the untouched glass of wine. A few grunts of affirmation come from the crowd and other wave in acknowledgement.

"Now then, off the masks you lot. If you want a room all I've got left is one of the ones with a view, and they aren't cheap tonight. 10 coins gold standard." Serra says.

Stepping over a man who can't seem to get to his feet, you head up the stairs to the room inscribed on the key. The room is little more than a bed and desk, simplistic ones at that. There is a door out to one of the 'proclaimed' balconies though, and you can see almost half the festival grounds from the vantage point. On the balcony are a handful of chairs for sitting and observing.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

After drunkenly mashing some leaves together rather than simply using healing magic, Nokri passes out on part of the bed, using Aldus and Eliran's conversation as a bedtime story.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

After a short little crisis over his wounds and some less than top notch "care" from Nokri. Aldus and Eliran talk for awhile out on the balcony about the woman Aldus overheard the men referring to earlier. They decide that they will rest, and when they wake they will set out to the festival overlook - where they mentioned to be keeping her.

After their talk Aldus lies back in bed next to Nokri. It feels awkward but he really needs quality  rest and so he elects to ignore it. *At least she's facing the other way* he thinks to himself. It takes him awhile to get to sleep that night due to not only the awkwardness of sharing the room with two virtual strangers, but also the discomfort of strange plant matter now dried and caked to his stomach. In his half asleep state his mind begins to wander to the last time he shared a bed with someone, how comfortable it was, how perfect everything seemed back then - the memory is quickly interrupted by pain in his chest that quickly drops to his stomach. The pain is not from any bruise or wound this time though. Aldus lets out small groan - almost a whimper. He decides counting deer in his head is probably a better way of falling asleep instead.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-29*

Eliran follows Aldus in, and bids the laguz good night. As Aldus gets all set for bed, Eliran instead grabs his lute and whats left of Nokri's drink and heads outside, closing the balcony door behind him. Taking a sip, he recoils slightly, _what did she put in this thing?_ he wonders as he takes his seat again. Since it was still relatively early in the evening, he took some time to play softly on his lute and practice a slow lullaby. 

As he hums into the night, Eliran considers the days events, wondering when the last time he had joined a party was. _Maybe it would be nice to take a journey again_ He thought to himself, _the laguz seems nice enough._  

As the night got later and later, Eliran brought one of the outdoor chairs into the room. Forming a pillow out of some clothes, he laid back in the chair, slowly falling into slumber.

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

Your room is awoken once during the evening, as fireworks and cheers echo from outside. The channels and canals running throughout the city streets have a huge flush of water flowing through them, all coming from the north side of town. The water flows like a rapid, snaking it's way through the city in a beautiful flow. Children reach their hands into the water laughing and couples kiss in the spray of the water. The many bonfires you saw in the city are snuffed out as the water hits them, slowly darkening the city systematically as the water hits every canal. Soon the lights of the festival are all gone and only personal lights remain as people begin to work their way home. 

- - -

The first thing you notice in the morning is that the bed was not that comfortable. Second, as you glance out the balcony, the festival is being taken down outside. Work crews tear down tents and stalls while children run about cleaning up garbage rather than going to school. Despite what seems like half the town working on the task at hand you can easily see across the fair grounds. You can't see a single man in the uniform of the men last night, which will let you travel the city freely. 

- - -

You don't have much difficulty retracing your steps from last night. The original inn is continues to be quite nice looking, it's cozy decor and warm feeling still there after the festival. As you head in, the balding man sweeping the floor turns to you and gets a sour look.

"Oi, you two!" he says, looking at Aldus and Nokri. "You think you could manage to not get in a fight in one of my rooms? I don't run a dive here!" He pauses, nodding to Eliran before turning back to the two. "...What are you doing back here? After that trouble upstairs I'd expect you'd have left the city at daybreak." he looks questioningly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-01*

Eliran raised a hand to calm the Inn Owner, "Look normally we would have been gone as soon as the gates opened, but we wanted to check in on your daughter, is that asshole from the past week still harassing her? Is she ok?" he looked around. "We heard something from one of the goons yesterday that made us worried."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-01*

The instant they walked into the inn, Nokri had her good girl game face on. She coyly walked up to the inn owner as though regretful for what happened. "We're quite sorry about the room sir, I've no idea how this mess came to be. As you can see we were quite dinged up by it," she stated, motioning towards Aldus and her cut-up shoulder, which wasn't from last night's battle, but the inn keeper didn't need to know that. Assuming payment for the room would be fully taken care of, Nokri shot a glance at Eliran and retreated a few steps back to let him do what he needed.

**Bill** - *2018-02-01*

"My daughter? She was out with her boyfriend for the night at the festival..." he replies, a dozen emotions crossing his face. He turns on a heel towards the stairs only to turn right back around as the door opens behind the four of you. Pounding foot steps are accompanied by a running jump hug from a young girl Eliran recognizes as the inn keeper's daughter. She's a tad hysteric but looks no worse for the wear. 

"Oh Dad!" she finally says. "Last night was terrible! I was bothered by that jerk's men again, the one who want you to sell the inn!" Her Father's eyes narrow, but before he can say anything she continues. "But it's also wonderful! The second time they got to me, I'd split up with Trent then, a mage not too much older than me came by! She put the fear of god in them, including the boss!" 

"That's..." her father struggles with conflict emotions for a minute. "Good honey, but I'm more worried about you. You shouldn't haev been involved in any of that." 

"I mean it sucks yeah, but our problem is solved! The mage said if they tried anything else, they'll have to go through the *Sage* on Amnesty street first!" she exclaims. Her father's brows shoot up.

"He's such a recluse though! Who is this girl?" he says half to himself. "Still, as long as you're alright." he says with a soft look into her eyes. She nods emphatically and he accepts her response. He then looks over to you three. 

"... What are you still doing here? Clearly I shouldn't be worried about my daughter, and you still wrecked on my rooms," he drawls, and hearing about the room gets you a look of shock from his daughter. "So I can call the guard anytime you know? You don't have any where to be?" he adds, though the threat sounds empty, just sarcastic. He brings his daughter over to the bar stools and they sit down, talking in quieter voices.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran leads the disgruntled pair to the amnesty street sages door, knocking on it when they arrive.

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

It's not hard to miss the tower on Amnesty Street. Much like the rest of Evard's architecture the white stone and smooth edges dominates the appearance of the at least 3 story tower. Ivy hangs and grows all around the upper levels, going as high as the roof. It's been landscaped, if you can use that term for it, to have no ivy with in arm's reach. This makes it stand out from other buildings where ivy falls around doorways and windows. 

When you knock you hear nothing for a while. Just as you start to think no one's home you hear a disgruntled "oh right" and begin to hear footsteps. Coming the door is a tall man with black hair. His frame is wirey and adds to his age, making him look flimsy. He wears a black robe over his house clothes and his hair is unkempt. He cocks an eyebrow at your group. Thinking for a moment, he makes his decision and steps aside.

"I assume you have something you wish to discuss? You're an odd lot so I'll listen, have a seat in the parlor." He says. 

His parlor area is more bookshelf than parlor, but it's not hard for you each to sit. He steps behind a massive table on side of the room and fiddles with some of the many supplies on the table. After a moment he finishes and leans back against the bookshelf behind him. 

"Well hello. I am Zaimar, Sage on Amnesty and I have no idea who you three are. What brings you to my home." he says with a nod of his head indicating you should speak up.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

Following Eliran to the Sage on Amnesty Aldus tries to calm himself down from him and Nokri’s blow out. He really just couldn't wrap his head around what kind of person Nokri was. She didn't seem to care about anything or anyone, but she agreed to help anyway. But when the opportunity at information arose she passed it up, why was she traveling with him if she didn't actually want to help? She could have just stayed in Theonovene or gone her own way. His mind runs around in circles trying to reason out why Nokri would be the way she is, and thinking of a million better comebacks now that the fight was “over”. 

Before he realizes it they are at the Sage’s tower. As the person who requested to meet The Sage, Aldus finds it appropriate that he’d be the one to knock on the door. When a spindly, older man with dark hair answers the door promptly inviting them in, Aldus is taken aback for a minute *Well he sure seems more welcoming than I had expected* he nods, muttering a small thank you as the three of them shuffle into the space that is overcrowded with books. He takes a seat, and a moment to collect himself making sure there is no leftover animosity in his voice. 

Aldus takes a deep breath and begins to explain “I suppose there’s no sense in beating around the bush, I might as well get straight to the point.” He pauses for a second thinking how he wants to go about explaining his issue. “Well, as you can tell I’m wolf laguz but even though I am well past the age, I’m still unable to use my wolf form. I’ve tried many different remedies back in my homeland, but I ran out of options. My… acquaintance here tells me she’s heard of a solution for this but only in a book she no longer possess. So upon hearing that there was a sage here, and that you had quite the collection of books, I had to at least try. Would you happen to know of a potion, or herb, or even a type of magic that could help me?”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

Nokri stalked the duo from a distance of several paces, still seething. The fact that they both had valid points just made her angrier, and she was enraged that they had called her out. Walking through the bustling town did little to soothe that, but it did give her time for introspection. 

*They should be thankful I’m following their sorry butts around,* she thought bitterly. Maybe she was treating them a little harshly, the complete opposite of how she normally treats her clients. But Eliran wasn’t her client, so her opinion of him was hard to budge. *If it stops their darn complaining I can act a little sweeter. Ugh. They better be grateful.*

The sage’s house was pretty neat, Nokri enjoyed looking at it and the way plants only wrapped around the upper floors. Whoever owned this had money. She slipped inside after the boys, doing a little curtesy now that they were in the presence of someone cultured and well-respected. 

“You wouldn’t happen to know the location of such a book either, would you good sir?” she inquired after Aldus laid straight their reason for visiting.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-08*

Eliran kindly thanked the old man, and gestured to Aldus when they arrived, since he didn't actually know what they needed. 

Eliran then spent most of the time looking around at the Sages quarters, they were really something. He thought back to the girls story of how she was saved, _didn't she mention somebody young helped her?_ he thought, _maybe he has an apprentice_

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

Zaimar listens carefully, literally turning an ear towards Aldus as Aldus tells his story. He nods at the end of it, almost as if he were on auto pilot. You can see him frown slightly and his brows furrow as he thinks for a moment. Finally he stops leaning against the wall, placing his hands down on the table in front of him and leaning over to look at you.

"You have... both excellent and miserable luck." he starts. "I am aware of that book. The potion work you see on this very table is another potion by the same brewer. His works all related to the mind in a way, and it earned him scorn by others who didn't understand the minds of men need healing as much as their bodies. It is in that sense, you have excellent luck." he says.

"Your miserable luck is due to my apprentice. You see, she stole this book from me naught but last night. I begrudge her not, she is young and the youth are prone to foolish actions." he lifts his hands from the table, turn around to look at his bookshelves. "But I care a great deal about her; as an sage is prone to. I certainly don't think she is ready to be out roaming the world. And even beyond that, I can't have everyone stealing my possessions. It sets a bad precedence, don't you think?" he says over his shoulder.

"I have a good feeling she's headed to the west; towards Eraia and their light magic monastery. She's a prodigy with anima magic and she's been talking about branching out to light spells for years. I'd like to broker a deal with you." he turns around, standing tall with an amiable smile and his hands clasped behind his back. "If you can retrieve my wayward apprentice and my stolen property, I'll do everything in my power to brew that potion for you. As you can see," he waves an arm at the table before him, "it's not the first time I've crafted potions from that brewmaster. It's truly important to me that young Desii get back to me safely..." he finishes. 

"What say you?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

“W-wait…. Really?” For a second Aldus can’t believe what the man has just told him, sure it’s not an instant solution to his problem, but it more than he’s had to go on in…. well - in forever. He doesn't wait for the other two to reply. Sure, having them along for the trip may come in handy but… well if they don’t want to come with him he’ll make due, this was simply way too good of an opportunity for him to pass up. 

“Yes, yes of course I will look for her and for your book! What does she look like? Which city is the light magic monastery in? What path do you think she may have taken? Any information you have that would come in handy - even if it’s just speculation - would be appreciated.”

 Aldus feels more excitement than he has since he left Wynne. *Finally - a real lead, perhaps if this all works out - I can go home, maybe they’ll accept me again. Maybe- maybe Layda would* - he visibly shakes his head, dispelling the thought *No* he tells himself firmly. 

“I will be glad to help you, and you help me in return!” He smiles widely and earnestly at the man.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-12*

The sound of someone else stealing her client made Nokri frown. It was great that she wouldn't have to do all the work, as some potions are a pain to make and one as obscure as this was sure to be a headache to mix. But it made her travels up until now rather redundant and she regretted ever getting involved.

*What other potions are in that book?* she wondered, piping "what is that there potion on the table for?" If it was anything valuable, taking a chance to get that book for herself might not be a bad idea. *If the apprentice ran away from home she must have had a good reason to say good riddance. Maybe the sage is an overbearing freak.*

"What kind of person is your apprentice?" Nokri tacked on after Aldus asked of her appearance. They would need to know this information to find her. And if Nokri could find and befriend her first, maybe she could obtain the book and its contents for herself as well.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Eliran rubbed his chin, he didn't have any particular reason to go hunting for this girl, however, he was already Eraia bound, and he would like to thank her for dealing with the thugs. 

Hearing a much quicker response from Aldus, Eliran thought to himself how helpful it would be to have some traveling companions as well, even if Nokri didn't seem any more worthy of trust than an unreputable mercenary. 

"I am willing to help look for the girl and your possesions, I'm on my way to Eraia for a competition anyways." Eliran finally responded, "As a question, are there any things about her we should be wary of? I mean she did steal from you." He asked tacking on after Nokri. If she was potentially dangerous, they would need to be ready to fight her just in case.

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Zaimar smiles at your response. He nods as you ask your question, clearly pleased by your enthusiasm. 

"I'm glad you take this serious. Desii is around your age, 5 and a half feet tall with short brown hair. She's got brilliant blue eyes and freckles as well. I expect you'll find her in her usual outfit, white blouse and her little hip cape, with a standard tunic and pants. The latter are truly unbecoming of the young lady, but no one can deny her reasoning..." he sighs.

"If there's anything to recognize her by is just how clumsy she is. Brilliant as she is, she can barely handle walking without hitting the floor. You'll likely recognize her by that more than anything else. She's a kind soul, underneath her troubled actions." He pauses for a moment. "She's a skilled mage even as just my pupil. She might attack you out of fear, but once you bring her back her we'll clear up any misunderstandings. If it comes to brawl, between her klutziness and your number you should best her. I ask that you of course go easy on her, she is just a girl."

"Hmm, what else... Ah yes. I can give you a copy of a map that will show you the route through Callora as a whole. I expect, given she's not the fastest traveler, you'll head her off sooner than the Eraian border. Ah, I recommend this." he rummages around in some scrolls for a moment to reveal a map of the Callorian region.

"There's a town right here, on the Eraian border. As I recall from my last trip to Eraia, every traveler stops in the town for hospitality and rest before hitting the border crossing. The town was very good at remembering who comes through because of it. Head for there. They'll be able to tell you if you passed Desii or if she's already crossed the border. The town is called Miyashire." he points out the town on the map before providing the rolled up scroll to Aldus. At that moment, one of his flasks begins to bubble a bit. 

"I have to get back to this lest my tower go up in a plume of smoke, so unless you have anything pressing I'll be anxiously awaiting your return with my pupil; and my book." he says with a short bow, before jogging behind to his potion work. 

(ooc: You can take yourselves out of town, wrap up any provisions, have any more conversations. I'll shift you to the next location Thursday.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Before leaving town, Eliran hit the post office to see if anybody needed something delivered to Eraia. As he always traveled, he often offered to deliver letters for people along the way as a method of a small bonus income. Eventually amassing a small bag of letters for places along the route to Eraia and a small bag of money as a payment, he made his way about checking out of town, bidding farewells to the assorted locations he played for as well as a few friends. 

He then consulted the local merchant quarter, seeing if there were any caravans or troupes that wouldnt mind an extra body guard, musician, or helping hand in return for a ride in the direction of Eraia. If they wanted to catch this girl, they would need faster transport if possible.

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

It's a few weeks time before you reach Miyashire. The route you received from Zaimar is effectively the main trade route across the Alliance. It's fairly busy and you're able to travel with some of the caravans for a few days at a time before the caravan stops at the kingdom you're passing through. It makes for leisurely travel with little to worry over. The war doesn't affect many people up here and it shows. 

The caravans dwindle out about two thirds of the way through your trip. Most head north to the kingdom of Callora and it's capital Etrina. While it's a bit quieter the trip is no more difficult. The only oddity is you don't see anyone coming from Miyashire as you approach the town. 

You can see why as you crest the hill to the town's location. It's midday as you arrive and the hot weather is more akin to the recently passed summer than the fall. The town is small, spacious and bordered by farmlands. Most of it's buildings are wood, placed in a haphazard block arrangement that leaves plenty of space around each building but a few central walkways through the town. 

Most prominent as you approach are the damage that have been done to the town. Plenty of the crops in the field are snapped and broken, while there are both burn marks and straight up damage to the buildings. Half a dozen roofs are caved in and plenty of walls have holes in the them. What people you do see in the town look miserable, shuffling about on errands or trying to fix something broken. All in all, the town looks like it's been under some kind of siege.

You aren't bothered on your way to the center of town. A small grassy park decorates it, with a damaged statue of a young woman as it's centerpiece. The woman, before being pulled down and broken, was garbed in robes and was outstretching an arm with a smile on her face. There are a few people in the square. A man who looks terribly down on his luck is sleeping on a bench. A young woman is carrying a full bag from one store across the square to where ever she may be heading. She has a young boy in tow. A middle aged woman looks over the statue, dressed in mild finery. She looks over the statue with a shake of her head and writes some things down on a scroll.

he young woman with her son don't bat an eye at you as they disappear down a street. The older woman turns around to see the three of you after a moment. At first she seems surprised to see you, looking left and right. Quickly she catches herself and adjusts her waistcoat as a cover. She takes a first step towards you, putting a smile on her face. 

The smile fractures quickly, her lip quivering and brows showing that something is upsetting her. She turns to the side and walks away with her head down. The man you thought was asleep on the bench suddenly stirs, coming to his feet. He has a slight limp but approaches you with a halfhearted smile. 

"Don't mind poor Frin. She'd love to greet you herself, but it's hard given the current state of affairs." the man says. "I'm Tamus. I'm not much, but I represent Miyashire's welcoming presence, at least right now." he smiles wryly. "I"m already used to things looking like shit, unlike the rest of town." 

"I'll answer any questions I can for you, or leave you be if you'd like." He then jokes, "Can show you a restaurant that's still operating, for the small fee of a meal." and chuckles to himself.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

Setting out with the caravan, Aldus’s mood is visibly light and hopeful maybe even annoyingly so. With the new lead on his situation he can't help but thinking of new possibilities, daydreaming most of the trip away allows time to pass fairly quickly. As they get closer to the Eraian border the road begins to wear ever so slightly on him, as does the seemingly never ceasing heat of the south *and we’re not even that far south yet* he thinks. Nonetheless it’s nothing a little water and the removal of some of his heavier pieces of clothing can't relieve. 

Approaching Mirashire Aldus notes the lack of travelers heading their way - a stark contrast to the past weeks. He brushes it off and carries on with his companions but as they approach the town Aldus’s uneasiness increases… something isn't right here. As the three travel into town a heavy feeling hangs in the air, bringing Aldus’s head down from the clouds and back down to earth. Devastation is apparent throughout town. A lone old woman looks their way, puts on a obviously pained smile and carries on. A man follows her and introduces himself as Tamus, offering much needed answers to the state of this border town. 

Aldus shoots the man an inquisitive look in response to his attempt in light humor. He narrows his eyes slightly and asks the question he assumes must be on Eliran and Nok… well at least Eliran's mind. “What happened here?”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-26*

After several weeks on the road, Eliran had hoped to get a good nights sleep in Miyashire, as it was a common rest stop before entering Eraia. However, as they entered the town, he knew there would be little chance of this. 

Taking in the scene, Eliran frowned, _Either bandits are getting worse, or the Calloran and Eraian skirmishes are picking up again_ he thought to himself. As they reach the town center, a young woman and what Eliran assumes is her child disappear down a side street, and an old lady quickly breaks down before fleeing the scene. As a man approaches, Eliran looks at the broken statue, _this doesn't bode well_ he thought.
"

As Tamus makes his quip, Eliran only really had one specific question, "Did bandits do this? Or was it soldiers" he asked, gesturing to the towns clear battle damage.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

In the time it took them to travel, Nokri did some self reflection. She wasn't wholly reformed, but she determined that *maybe* she could be a little less rude. 
The warmer weather certainly makes her feel a bit more chipper, reminding her of warm days at home before the war took over. The lack of people they meet along the trail outside of the caravan is a bit unnerving, though, and the endless farmland that started out as quaint and picturesque eventually became too repetitive. "Are we almost there yet?" Nokri would ask repeatedly despite the trio being nowhere near an established civilization. To pass the time she would chew on leaves plucked from the farms, giving a slight reprieve from her boredom.

Nokri is thrilled by the time they finally make it to the town, yet quickly disappointed. It's just another hick farm town. The burn marks were intriguing though. Somebody or something obviously went on a rampage. Flame damage was very familiar to Nokri, and had they been in the warzone she would have assumed wyverns went haywire on the place. She wondered how much it would cost to repair the town. *Whoever destroyed the place might've even done them a favor, since obviously this place wasn't exactly a sight to behold before.*

Mouth still full of leaves from the trip, Nokri stepped back when a random old lady approached them. She gaped for a moment and then walked away, only to be replaced by a man cajoling them for a free meal. Feeding him wouldn't be too out of the question depending on the answers he could provide. Luckily Aldus asked the first thing on everybody's mind. Nokri didn't feel it necessary to talk, but disposed of the matter in her mouth anyway as depending on the man's answer things could get interesting.

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Tamus looks downtrodden for a moment as you ask your questions before visably sighing. He motions to the bench he was resting on before then sits opposite it, on the rim of the knee wall around the monument. 

"The shorter answer first" he says to Eliran, "is that this isn't Eraia invading with soldiers. If it was, we'd all be bowing our heads in pray about now." he says dryly. "Some people here believe it is though, especially the Kelit parents. I wouldn't listen to them too closely though, ever since their daughter disappeared a few years back they've been swearing up and down Eraia was behind it." He seems to catch himself for a second. "It was a terrible tragedy for the town of course." he adds sheepishly. 

"Lets see, as for what happened." he transitions, rolling his head and cracking his neck in the process. "We're not terribly sure. This damage was done two nights ago. Most people were asleep when this group rolled into town. They injured all of the night watch as they entered and started outright pillaging the place. Thankfully we didn't lose anyone, though almost everyone in town has an injury to show from the raid. It's not terribly surprising they had that in mind though. My theory is the lot of them are more arsonist than thieves. They had a fire mage with them, a skilled one at that. That was the cause of most of the damage we had."

"Anyway, lots of possessions were stolen, lots of homes have fire damage, and no one was able to see the faces of men and women who did this. The Kelits said the fire mage must be Eraian, because the mage wore white, but that's a big generalization. What are the odds some random person wearing white is a fire mage?" he shrugs. "I was in the thick of things though, let me tell you. Right from the start of the raid I was outside, because I like the stars, and..."

As Tamus continues his story, over his shoulder you can see a young woman with short brown hair walking into the courtyard. She has on a white blouse and wears a hip cape around her waist. She's checking a piece of paper for directions, looking this way and that. She has a leather knapsack slung over her shoulder. She heads down a side street as Tamus finishes his story about he saved the mayor, Frin, from getting an axe to the head.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-01*

Nokri had little interest in Tamus's story once he started rambling. She picked out the interesting tidbits, such as the Kelit family's daughter and the reason behind the damage, but then her attention was drawn to a pigeon on the ground that was infinitely more interesting than his highly exaggerated story.

The pigeon wandered to the edge of the courtyard and flew away as some chick entered. Short brown hair with a fashionable hip cape. The description sounded familiar. Nokri peered at Aldus and Eliran to see if they had noticed. She was itching to go up to the girl first and started backing away from the group. "Please excuse me, I have a very urgent need for the rest room," she stammered, more to dismiss herself from Tamus than the other two. If they weren't talking with somebody she would have just left without a word.

Nokri hurriedly ran around the courtyard and down the same alley, trying to get out of Eliran and Aldus's sight while still making a path towards the girl. As the girl's head was down Nokri ran full speed into her knapsack, trying to knock both of them over.  "Oh my goodness, I am *so* sorry!" she exclaimed. "Are you okay? Are you hurt? I was trying to get away from someone and wasn't watching where I was going." Nokri offered a helping hang, trying to catch sight of the girl's eye color to help discern her identity.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

Adlus scratches the stubble on his chin as the man gives his personal account of what occurred. He’s relieved to find out no one was lost but puzzled as to what type of person or group would have caused this. As the man continues Aldus’s eyes survey around the courtyard, taking in his surroundings and the people about. He scans over the few people milling about as well as a woman in a white top and brown hair…. *No it can't be… could she be invol-* before his mind can complete the thought Nokri is running past him, straight toward the woman. *She’s gonna run straight into-* His mouth drops open as Nokri collides with the woman. “NOKRI!” He exclaims. “Im sorry sir I've gotta deal with something…” he tells the man while backpedaling then turns on his heel and hurries to catch up with Nokri and a woman matching a certain description.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

Eliran knew an exaggerated tale when he heard one, and as soon as Tamus started telling of his own exploits, he began to lose interest. 
What he didn't lose interest in were his surroundings, while Tamus had explained away the towns arsonist assault, Eliran continued to look at the damage and the people around the town center. When the young lady appeared, he kept an eye on her, wondering how to dodge the conversation and hold her down for a minute, however the Nokri seemed to be ahead of him with her "Urgent need for the rest room". It was a pretty lame excuse, but apparently, their story teller was lamer.

Still, Eliran didn't quite trust Nokri and her tendency to lie extremely poorly, and he really wanted to get away from Tamus's story (Seriously how much can a guy toot his own horn) so he offered his own reason as he slowly side stepped around and away from the group, "Sorry Tamus, Aldus here is going to have to listen to the rest of your story, because I'm going to go find us a place to stay".  And Eliran was off. Unlike Nokri, Eliran just went straight down the side street acting as if he was looking for a store or something; which he was as well, cause the did actually need somewhere to stay.

As he noticed Nokri's collision, Eliran, who had clearly left a bit before Aldus, rushes over to the two ladies..? he wasn't sure if Nokri deserved the title. women, sure, female? yes. Lady? a mental shrug was in order. "Are you two alright?" He asks concerned.

**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

The young woman somehow manages to tumble with Nokri as Nokri 'bumps' into her. The two roll a few times before ending up on a heap in the ground. While Nokri stands, the strange looks at her now dusty white blouse and looks terribly forelorn. When Nokri offers her a hand up the girl looks the Drecian girl over. The girl's blue eyes dart to towards the wolf faunus running towards them, shouting "Nokri". 

She takes Nokri's hand immediately and pulls her self up. The woman takes a half step in front of Nokri and lets her knapsack slide around her front. She pulls a spell book from it and flips it open, point a hand forward at the approaching Aldus and Eliran.

"Stop! If this little girl is trying to get away from you you must leave her be! I won't see anyone else harassed like that!" the girl says with more bravado than you'd expect from someone with such soft features. You can tell she's determined her her statement, but she just doesn't have the features to be truly intimidating. 

Even so the lightning bolt that cracks to the ground not 5 feet in front of the boys more than makes up for it. She was able to mutter the spell in no more than second which only makes the manipulation of nature all the more impressive. Nokri is left a few feet behind the girl apparently defending her, while Aldus and Eliran are a good 30 feet from the young woman facing off with them.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-02*

Blue eyes. Bingo. But there was no time for elation, because *of course* Nokri wasn't the only one to spot her. Or maybe Nokri's sudden disappearance made them rightly suspicious. Either way, things were going to get rocky now that they were here.

This girl was amazing. Nokri had real panic in her eyes and held fast onto her hand and pulled her up, then prepared to run off with her. But instead she turns around and blasts them, leaving a nice scorch mark in the road. Nokri got the feeling she was gonna like this girl. "Watch out!" she squeaked. "My ex-boyfriend and his bunch is not friendly when mad... a-and they know how to fight... it might be better to run!" As the static in the air died down Nokri stood behind the girl like some frightened child and continued shakily to spit out "I thought he was the kindest, most gentlest man but as soon as we started dating he changed, he changed so much, and I tried to leave him but that only made him angrier and... oh this isn't good! I don't want you caught up in our trouble, I'm so sorry!"

While standing behind, Nokri tried to take a glance over the girl's shoulder at her book. Even if that wasn't the tome they were originally searching for, it would be worth a pretty penny on its own. She gently took hold of the girl's sleeve, as though urging her that they should escape fast.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Aldus stops short, stumbling slightly as the new small woman whips around and fires a bolt of electricity only a few feet in front, and directly in between him and Eliran Obviously a warning shot. She’s also taken a protective stance over Nokri, But why? Did she not just hit the woman with the full force of her tiny body, barreling her over? Aldus cocks his head, puzzled. This is obviously the woman they are looking for - Brown hair, blue eyes, traveling clothes, and evidently a mage of some talent. Why would she attack them? Further - why would she protect the person that just plowed into her?

When Nokri first squeaks out “Watch out” Aldus feels a wave a relief roll over him *Oh good, she's going to explain that we’re with her, and only trying to help* But that wave is quickly replaced with one of disappointment and dread. His ears droop as if he's being scolded. He feels his tail begin to move toward his legs. *Ex-boyfriend?! Is she talking about me? Who is she talking about? Is she serious right now…..*  

As Nokri recounts her “bad relationship” with who he can only imagine is supposed to be himself, it only gets worse. He feels his heart drop to his stomach frozen in place as this small woman who barely knows him paints him in a light he knows all too well. She’s talking about him the same way Aldus might speak of his father. His father - The man who’s disappointment and abuse spurred this entire departure from Wynne to begin with. He stares at Nokri, stunned. “How could she” he says too quietly for her to hear, she doesn't know this about him obviously and it’s not like she wouldn't have said those things otherwise. He was hoping after their little blow out she’d consider lightening her tone, but that hope has been extinguished now.

He can only run damage control now, he has to chose his next actions and words carefully. Try to defuse this situation as quickly as possible. He doesn’t want a rehash of the occurrence in the inn a few weeks ago. He slowly raises his hands in surrender, not making any sudden movements and bows his head slightly, ears still in a downward position. 

“Desii please, do not believe her words. I know you have no reason to listen to me but believe me when I say I would sooner throw myself from the cliffs of the nearest shore than be the man she has just described to you. My name is Aldus, and this is Eliran, the woman falsely accusing me of atrocities is Nokri. I assure you this is an act of hers. We were sent by Zaimar, he worries for you. He sent us to bring you home to straighten out whatever caused you to run away with his tome. Please know He is not angry with you. We also require your self, or rather, I require your help.”

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

The young woman continues to glare at Aldus as he begins to explain himself, right up until he mentions begin sent by Zaimar. Her eyes flutter and she starts in a brief panic. She whirls around with her closed book, smacking Nokri up side the head and knocking the girl to the ground. 

"So that's his game is it, use children to get to me? Could he be more twisted?" She says, running down the alley she originally headed towards. She sprints to the next corner, her tome clutched tightly to her chest, before turning the corner to the left. She stumbles slightly as she does, knocking over some barrels that roll into the street, conveniently making pursuit a little more difficult. With Aldus's Niassankari hearing he can hear the girl shout 'sorry' as she runs. 

```
Side goal: Catch up!
Target: 6
Pool: 4
```

(ooc: This is not a conflict, just a side goal. Think of it as a one/two round encounter. I'm going to award dice for your efforts chasing the girl, and after enough successes you'll catch up. The difficulty will still be whichever approach your actions is closest to. There's no damage to be had, though you could lose her if you take *too* long.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-05*

The bolt of lightning lashing out behind him surprised Eliran, "Christ!" he exclaimed in surprise jumping forward a bit before looking back at where it struck. Looking back at the young girl, he raised his hands in the universal "I'm innocent" pose. Continuing to move forward, Eliran took his steps slowly and carefully, as if approaching a dangerous animal. "Now Miss, theres no need to get excited... I just wanted to see if you were ok after that fall." he said slowly, "I'm not chasing down Nokri and I could care less if she ditched our quest, because that means she doesn't get any of the reward, or the prize money I was thinking of sharing if we made it too Eraia.." he called out, emphasizing the parts about the reward and prize money.  

Annnnnnddd she's gone. Eliran sighed, why do people always run, and why did Aldus have to be so pure as to think that the girl who ran away from the Sage would want to go back. Shrugging, Eliran gave chase, following the girl and easily vaulting over the barrels as they go past. He was experienced in running away due to some issues in his less savory past, which meant he knew how to give chase as well.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

Desii’s reaction at the mention of Zaimar’s name clearly indicates that he shouldn’t have mentioned that detail. In the rush to clear his name he had forgotten to consider that Desii probably wouldn’t want to run back home after so much effort to run away. Her comment about them being children catches him off guard, *Children? How old can she be?* She’s quite small and Aldus can't imagine her being much older than the three of them. But before he can even form the question she's off, heading the way she was going when Nokri decided to tackle her. 

Aldus glares at Nokri “Ancestors Nokri, ever heard of being subtle?! Ugh!” he doesn’t wait for her to respond and pushes of in Desii’s direction, a few feet behind Eliran. He doesn’t expect Nokri to follow and in that moment he doesn’t care if he ever sees her small scowling face ever again. 

The woman doesn't seem very coordinated, just as Zaimar had said. The observation is solidified when he hears a crash and then an apology, obviously to an unexpecting townsperson. 

He considers the irony in this situation. If he was like the rest of his kind this chase would have been over before it even started. Of course if he was like the rest of his people he wouldn't even be here, chasing some small overly ambitious mage through a scorched town. He sighs, which comes out as more of a grunt with the force of his footfalls. At the very least, the path of destruction left in her wake should leave it easy to track her.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-08*

"See how they li-" Nokri was saying as the bag hit her squarely in the jaw. She had the most offended look on her face as she jumped up in hot pursuit of the girl. Obviously she was not alone in this action.

"Ex*cuse* me? Subtlety? I've been the most subtle of us all. Who exactly spilled all the beans here?" she spat. "And reward? Pah. Having the sage fix Aldus's little *problem* doesn't put food in my stomach."

She was so busy shaking her head and ridiculing the two that her reaction to the tipped barrels was delayed. Nokri began to slow down but tripped over one anyway, doing a vaguely impressive somersault before getting conked in the head with another barrel. *This is fantastic* she thought bitterly.

You turn the corner and Desii hasn't made it half way down the block yet, apparently having bumped into someone and stopping to help them up. She looks quickly to her left and right and notes there are no side streets to run down, just rows of battered brick and wood buildings and the occasional pedestrian. She turns on her heel and flips open her spell book again, legs wide and looking straight at your approach, the distance between you only 20 some odd feet. 

"I'm not going back there willingly." she says, her tone low and controlled. "Do you know what he wants me for? If you do, I can't believe you'd be so low as to help him. If you don't..." she trails off, as if considering the possibility you don't. "Then everything he's told you is likely a lie." she says, softer than before. The edge to her voice returns right after. 

"Just turn around and leave me be. Magic isn't meant for combat, but I promise you I can spwan hellfire long before you even nock an arrow." She says. Her voice isn't exactly threatening, she doesn't have the pitch for it. But you can see the fire in her eyes, that she's drawn her line in the sand and she's waiting to see if you'll cross it.

(ooc: Not so subtle reminder that you can resolve conflicts without combat. The problem here is you are at a stand off. You can earn dice by *doing anything to defuse that situation*, which could be backing up, cracking jokes, presenting evidence, asking questions, whatever you think will end the stand off. Combat can of course end a stand off as well. Also remember if you give me a list of questions in your post, I'll consider them asked back and forth rather than in a block.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Aldus raises his hands out in front of him in the peace gesture that's becoming quite natural at this point. His face falls into a expression of sympathy “Desii, can we just talk about this? No one is making you back to him. Truthfully we don't know much about him, I am simply following a lead.” Aldus frowns at the thought of leaving the man out of his own personal equation, but he would never want someone to stay in - or return to - a situation that is damaging to them. Maybe Desii would know enough to help Aldus without needing to involve Zaimar? Still… there isn't much time to worry about that now. He doesn't want to fight, she seems to have her own side of this and he would prefer to not get struck by lightning today… or any day for that matter. “Please let us discuss this, there's no reason we need to fight today.”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

Nokri picked herself up, checking the inside of her bag to make sure nothing was damaged. There was enough junk to serve as padding that nothing broke yet, luckily. Hurriedly she tried to catch up to the others.

"I had no intention of helping these guys in the first place," Nokri complained, hoping that Desii would hear her over the ruckus she was causing. "I want *nothing* to do with them." Shooting a glare that may or may not just be acting, She shoves her way in front of Aldus and Eliran, putting herself between them and the girl. "You're Desii?" she asked. Nokri doubted the two boys would ever forgive her after this, but before she proceeded any further she wanted to be absolutely certain this was the girl they were after. It'd be useless to go this far for some random chick, no matter how strong she may be.

"Don't listen to them! I won't let you kidnap this poor girl. I know how awful you are, the things you would do to her." Nokri hoped that the girl would see her as an ally. They could be gal pals. She took out a vial from her bag, already bubbling from being shaken about during the chase. *Shall I smash it into the wall, or throw it onto the ground?* she wondered, her eyes darting back and forth figuring out the best way to break it so her and the girl could make a clean escape.

Desii's grip on her tome seems to lighten a bit as Aldus placates. Nokri stepping forward as well initially seems to easy Desii more, yet the more Nokri speaks the tighter the hold becomes. 

"Yes, I am Desii Manette of Hylley." the girl says. "The child says one thing and you say another thing... whoever you are." she adds pointedly to Aldus. "What is the truth? What relationship do you have with Zaimar?" Desii looks left and right, seeing one or two onlookers to the stand off. Her foot shuffles slightly, though her eyes remain locked on the three of you.

"Will I would speak with you I don't yet trust if I put this book down you'll not drug and capture me. I'd have you earn that much trust before we sit and chat like old friends."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-12*

Eliran steps forward with his hands raised to show no weapons and placate the girl.  He crouched down and very slowly put his bow on the ground, "regardless of what nokri says, we mean no harm, " he began, "as far as we were told, you left the Zaimar and took his spellbook or something" he continued to slowly put his lute case down as well, "Aldus and I took his quest because according to him, with the use of that stolen book Aldus could be cured of his disorder. Since I myself am on the way to an Eraian archery tournament," Eliran gestured towards his bow, "and Aldus was going to Eraia to look for potential cures there, we thought there was no harm in also finding you. We have no intention of using force for any of this." 

Eliran then looked behind towards nokri and back to Desi, frowning "as for her, I only know she was traveling with us in hope for some reward, and I'd honestly be happy if she left. Since I met her, she has only feigned knowledge, and often times lied or tried to mislead others for her own profit." He crossed his arms "Take her on your journey with you if you are worried about what she says about us, I don't want to travel with somebody who so easily lies and attacks their companions."

``` 

Desii takes one last look across each of your group's faces before her shoulders sag and some of the tension leaves her. 

"I have the book Zaimar wants, yes. I did technically steal it from him. It is a collection of potions made by Danthres Uilosra, a visionary in the field of potion work. That said, Danthres was expelled from every college there is for continuing research on potions that can permenantly change a person in ways they may not want." she hesitates for a moment. "One of those ways is a love potion. While there's no record of a successful usage, Danthres has a recipe for a potion that, on ingestion, causes powerful lusting for the person the potion is brewed for. Danthres's description is rather... perverse, and the victim won't even realize their thoughts aren't their own."

"As... arrogant as it feels to say, Zaimar is quite obsessed with me. He has been for a few years. I ignored him, never thinking he'd act maliciously... But he was trying to brew that potion. When I found out, I knew I had to leave. And I wasn't going to leave him the instruction manual, in case he changed his target to some other poor girl." She looks down at her feet, lightly twisting one foot into the dirt. 

"A-anyway. I infer when you say transform you mean into your laguz form. I'm not familiar with Danthres's work myself, I don't really do potions. But if there's anyone whose got a fix for such an odd problem, it's Danthres Uilosra. I... won't give you the book, given why I have it in the first place, but I can happily share notes." Desii smiles lightly at the Naissankari. "I'd certainly like to help you if I can."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-19*

As Desi speaks everything starts to make a lot more sense. When she tells them the book is by a man names Danthres, about his less than conventional methods, Aldus feels conflicted, *would the potion even be safe for him to take if he could get his hands on it? Would it be worth it.* He doesn't have much time to consider this because as Desi elaborates on Zaimar, Aldus becomes disgusted. She explains the man’s plans for brewing a potion designed for less than savory means. And that Zaimar intended to use it on her. Aldus face screws up into disgusted expression. Until know he hadn’t suspected any ill will in the man but now, Aldus was revolted he even spoke to a man of such low caliber.  

“You did the right thing Desi, you are a very brave girl. Please know I did not suspect this from him and in no way support him. If you are willing to help me I would be grateful. I’m not sure how I feel about this man’s work as whole, but if there is something in that book that can help I have to pursue it. Do you know where I might find this Danthres Uilosra? And if it’s not too much to ask, perhaps you could provide me with a copy of the pages relevant to me? I doubt I would be able to decipher what the pages hold. I realise this is alot to ask of you of course”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-19*

Eliran frowned at the explanation Desi offered, and his frown slowly turned to disgust as she continued. By the time she finished, he spat, cursing, "_kyst_ I'm sorry" he said, "if I had known I'd have burned the man's study before helping him.." 
Eliran shook his head, "I figured that since you had proclaimed he'd protect the bar girl he was a good man... but so much for that." 
Eliran stood up, picking up his lute and bow, when suddenly his stomach growled loudly, he looked mildly embarrassed, "sorry about that... anyways, since we have no reason to chase you anymore, does anybody want to go somewhere where we can get food? I haven't eaten today and it's already past noon." 
He looked towards Desi then back to Aldus, "it'd be a good chance for you two to discuss the potions and stuff as well."

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Desii finally seems to drop her guard; she no longer has her tome page bookmarked with a finger and her wide combat stance is lost as she taps her heels together lightly. She looks around the area for a moment before looking to you with a sheepish smile. 

"Maybe I can elaborate more somewhere... less public?" she says with a small awkward laugh. She motions for you to follow her as she heads down the street with her tome under her arm, her eyes glued to the ground in front of her and certainly not avoiding eye contact with onlookers to your group's little show. 

- - -

Desii leads you a few blocks before stopping in front of an inn. It's a tired looking building, with faded wood and what paint is left has lost it's sheen. The door sign has lost it's detailing as well, making it very hard to read 'Crow's Kilt'. 

"I helped these people out during the attack that did all the damage around town. It's not the nicest inn in town but their kindness has more than made up for it." Desii says as she walks through the front yard of the inn.

"Hello Desii." you hear from inside not a moment after she opens the door. A man who looks as tired as the building stands behind the bar, idly washing glasses. He has sandy blonde hair and lines on his face that make up look far older than the late thirties man should. He has a scar under his right ear. "Found friends?"

"Something like that Dain." Desii says with a smile. "Is Saila not here?" 

"She's meeting with the mayor along with representatives of the rest of the businesses. We're going to have to do something, though I doubt anything we can do will be effective." he says. Desii only replies with a sympathetic look. Dain motions to sit down and Desii sits, waving you to join her. 

"So... to answer your question from before Mr... Aldus, Danthres passed away quite a long time ago. He left behind his work in his journal series, which he sent to numerous friends. Those friends have circulated the copies a bit, but it's still a tough work to get a hold of." Desii looks at Aldus's face and smiles reassuringly. "I said before I would not give you the book, but I have no problem sharing it's contents with you. We can look through it together here.' she says.

Desii looks awkwardly between Nokri, now nursing her drink at the bar, and the two men in front of her. She thinks for a moment to invite Nokri closer to hear better, but that thought is silenced remembering just how poorly her last inquiry went over. She decides the best option is to just get started on the book and promptly pulls Danthres's Journal from her bag. 

Desii carefully turns the pages of the tome. Her gaze is intense as she skims page after page. She frowns when flipping through a few particular pages, but other than that shows no interest in any of the other pages. The number she hasn't read dwindles and dwindles, the left side of the book becoming larger than the right. The journal is quite long and takes forever (at least in Aldus's mind) to go through. 

Finally Desii turns to a page and stops. She leans in a bit, then she smiles up at Aldus. "There is something here." she says at last. She reads it more throughly before sitting up again and explaining.

"It's more of theoretical cure than anything else, I should start with that. Danthres, much like with his lust potion, never tested it." she pauses, realizing what she said could crush Aldus's hopes. "Ah, but there's a reason he's so well regarded. None of the potions he theorized failed." she says quickly to ease his mind.

"The original concept was something to bring out the beast in a human. Danthres's theories were built based on combining the effects of ingredients and potions he knew the effects of. He took *Brakehweed*, which has the effect of putting people in a bit of a berserker state, then combined that with *Calholly*, a native plant from Wynne. If I remember correctly... Right, Calholly is poisonous to humans, yet serves as a wonderful spice to the laguz people. Anyway, that and few other mundane ingredients was to cover the animalistic part. The second set of components started with *Crysalin*, an Eraian plant that actually becomes water when it dies. It transforms from seed to water, it's quite unique in that. After that... oh my, it calls for *Denuh*..." Desii pauses, lost in thought completely. 

"Sorry, right. Denuh is a mineral stone that's found in Elbia, or well, was found in Elbia. Or I suppose I should say was found in Elbia. Any piece of Denuh would do, based on the recipe, but it's still quite difficult to find the stone. Be...yond that..." she trails off, heading back into the book. "That's it. Everything else isn't too hard to access. Run of the mill stuff." 

Desii gives you a moment to process, all the more helpful since she speaks quickly. Each of you recognize one of the components in a heartbeat. Nokri saw Brakehweed experimented on laguz in Drecian occupied area of the Kissaelain territories. It didn't take long before command gave up on that avenue, to volatile. There's no self respecting Wynnite wolf who doesn't know Calholly; both to prevent the Wynnites from eating it and because it's just that good. Denuh was one of many rare minerals of Elbia, something else lost to her fall. Eliran's met a handful of people in the past with Denuh accessories, elders who lives in Elbia in days before her collapse. The only thing you don't know the exact location of is the Crysalin, though you at least have a direction to head in.

"I... can't help with most of these... At least to any more specific locations than I've already given." Desii says. "Except for the Crysalin. I happen to know it grows out by Trisp, on the coastline. It's always been a fascinating plant to me." she says sheepishly. 

"They say drinking Crysalin water is like nothing you've ever tasted." Dain contributes from the bar. "Like alcohol without the alcohol." Desii nods to the bartender before turning back to the pages. When she looks up again this time, she closes the book with a bookmark on the page of the potion.

"The brewing looks like something you're going to want to have a skilled person do... You won't need the lead brewer of Theanovene's guild no, but not a total amateur. Shouldn't be hard to find." She says. She then smiles at Aldus. "There's definitely a cure for you. Isn't it wonderful?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-26*

The drink was quite satisfying. Not what Nokri was used to, but not half bad. She smiled to herself as she finished it off. Her mind started to wander from the conversation, but she occasionally picked up bits. *Calholly,* she thought. *What a fun plant. And I'd sure like to see that guy eat something with brakehweed in it. Hehe.*

As Desii finished listing her ingredients, Nokri decided she had enough and that she didn't need more information. A good walk was what she needed now. There was no way she was going to gather those ingredients on her own, but the recipe gave her some ideas for new brews to try out. Maybe one of them would be the cincher to securing her vast wealth, like a potion to reverse male pattern baldness that would be all the rage among balding nobles. Getting up from the chair, she stumbled a bit and nearly tripped before steadying herself on the bar. Shaking it off, she once again went for the exit and went outside. Still unfamiliar with the town but not exactly wanting to stick around in a busy square, the began heading the way they originally came, aiming to reach the town limits and see what was on its outskirts.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

Aldus sits at the table for what feels like an eternity watching Desii painstakingly comb through each page of the tome? Journal? Book? He of course is extremely thankful for this lead but *this is taking forever!!* He fidgets anxiously - bobbing his leg, running his fingers through his hair, counting the floorboards - anything to make time pass. 

Finally she speaks! The actual ingredients themselves don’t confort him either. Brakehweed sounds especially terrifying. Calholly he’s familiar with, just the name of it makes him nostalgic for a meal from home, who knew it might be able to help him with this? Hopefully he can find some on the mainlands as well. Crysalin sounds like something that’s not even real and Denuh seems like it will be especially hard to find. 

Finding someone to actually brew the potion sounds like the least of his worries. He scratches a small list down in the small journal he keeps in his bag - which he rarely uses. His face must be twisted in dome doubtful expression because Desii follows up with some much needed words of encouragement. 

“Yes, it is” He flashes a large heartfelt smile her way “Thank you Desii, you’ve given more hope then I have had in years in just a few short hours. It seems I have a lot of work ahead of me. I don’t know exactly what plans you may have but if you’ve nothing pressing I’d invite you to come along with us to wherever we travel to next.” He goes onto explain their tentative plan on traveling to Trisp and in doing so misses Nokri leaving the bar and stumbling outside.

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

"Wow, um, that's quite a generous offer." Desii says, nervously twisting her right foot against the floorboards. "I uh, well, you saw this morning that I have to worry about being followed by Zaimar, so I'd really just cause you more trouble." She says. She doesn't sound convinced by her own justification. She glances over to the bartender and takes a deep breath, that nervous energy flowing from her.

"I am going to Trisp though. I can help you find Crysalin too, if you help me with something else." she says somberly. The bartender walks into the back, almost as if on cue. "The bartender here, and his wife... I helped them out in the attack the other night. They showed me some hospitality, and they also told me their story."

"There have been plenty of attacks on this town in the past. The mountains are right there, and it is a border town. Eraia and Callora aren't usually at blows, but there are those with negative opinions of the other on either side. None to this level, the city watch here is quite skilled." Desii lays her hands on top of each other on the table, the upper one holding the lower. "During an attack years ago Dain and Saila lost their daughter. It was a violent attack and she was shopping near the point of attack."

"Dain and Saila don't think she was killed though. They, as any parent would, dove into the attacking force desperately trying to find their daughter. They swear the saw a man with Eraian regalia carrying Enera off. No one in town believes them. The whole town things Dain and Saila are just clinging to any fanciful story they can, rather than accept Enera's death." Desii says quietly. You can see in her eyes that she believe Dain and Saila.

"It makes sense, if only for one detail. Enera was a studying light mage. She was self taught but was doing wonderfully, from what I can tell. She was young enough at the time that if she was taken away, she could be convinced everything was fine." Desii finishes. "I said I'd look for her when I go into Eraia. Dain and Saila can't get across the border, but I was going to find a way somehow to begin with. If you help me look for her in Trisp, I'd be able to help you find Crysalin." Desii's eyes are passionate, you can see how much she's taken to this quest. She looks back and forth between you, pressuring you to answer with that same passion. 

- - -

Nokri bumbles down the block, avoiding the heavier traffic areas. "Heavier traffic" is more of a joke than anything, in the wake of the attack no one seems to be outside to begin with. 

Nokri feels a sudden tug on her left arm, yanking her into a side alley. A hand comes up to her mouth and the hand that pulled her in wraps around her waist, holding her arms to her torso. Twisting your head you can see that a man in a white cloak has pulled you into the alley.

"You, little miss, are of Drecian origin. And that makes you a sinner." He says into your ear. "I have use for you, so you may serve Lylalel even in sin." With that he slams you face first onto the ground, knocking the wind out of you while still holding your hands behind your back. He pulls out rope, quickly tying your wrists while you regain your breath. Just as you feel able to let out a cry for help, he stuffs a rag in your mouth making you feel uncomfortably like a suckling pig.

Suddenly both you and your captor hear a gasp. A middle aged woman with long brown hair and blue eyes is at the far end of the alley. Rather than fear, her face boils over with rage. "Not again!" she cries even as the man quickly tosses a dagger in her direction. She shields herself with her shopping bags as the man throws you over his shoulder and bolts. 

He runs with you through silent streets, not a soul to condemn his actions in sight. He has a horse tied on the east end of town, which he drops you on before climbing up himself. As you realize he's getting away with this, you see that same woman running up the street, panting and heaving. You can see her collapse to her knees as the man cracks the reins, the horse starting into a gallop.

(ooc: time skip, will occur later for the other half of the table)

You spend you time being kidnapped having your head bumped into a horse's ass and smelling the same ass. It's terribly unpleasant. The man says nothing on the trip. Eventually you reach the foot of the mountains and find yourself at a small cave in the hillside. The man ties off his horse to a tree and throws you back over his shoulder, heading into the cave. 

As you go deeper into the cave you begin to hear voices. It's not long before the cave opens up to massive hall. You enter from a second level entrance of sorts, to your left and right are crude staircases leading down to the expansive main floor. All across the main floor are what must be bandits. There's little doubt, given their smell and appearance. The man drops you in front of him, the sound of you losing your breath yet again call the room to attention. They don't look happy seeing the man either, but quiet down as he looks over the room.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-26*

Eliran listens closely to Desi, and an observant person would notice how he tenses up at the mention of Eblia. He had always wanted to return and see what was left of his grandfather's homeland, and this would provide a good excuse. 

Listening to the other ingredients, Eliran felt uncertain about giving somebody berserker juice, but what did he know about potions? 

After hearing Desi's request Eliran almost gave short laugh, it was ironic. They decided to go looking for a girl to bring her home, only to be asked by said girl to find another girl and bring her home.
Seeing Desi's look he realized he probably shouldn't mention the humor in the situation until a more opportune time. 
"A girl kidnapped?" Eliran asked, "how could we say no." He looked to Aldus, then back to Desi, "like you, we are already on our way into Eraia, plus our original intention was to try and find somebody en route to begin with" he looked a bit apologetic "sorry about that again." 

Eliran sat back in his chair, thinking about it a little more, "still... if what you say is true, we're gonna have to be really careful. If we're trying to free the girl from Eraian soldiers, we might end up being wanted criminals in a country of religious fanatics..."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-27*

With barely anyone in her path, Nokri was quite enjoying her tipsy stroll. The clouds in the sky were billowing like pillows and she was pleased once again to be free. She could go anywhere and do anything all by herself with nothing holding her back. It was just like when she became a deserter - her possibilities were nearly endless.

*Maybe there's a hick village here in the boonies out here in need of a doctor and I can get some reputation there,* she considered. Even if the current town was in shambles, one of the surrounding farms would surely have room to spare for a night or two for such a sweet angel like Nokri. She started rehearsing in her head exactly what she could say to find decent accommodations in the area, and what backstory would fit best.

Swaying to and fro, Nokri took slightly too wide of a step and promptly lost balance. Something moved to her left. Rather than helping her stand upright, as Nokri assumed would happen, the shadow jerked harshly on her arm and pulled her down. Had she been sober things may have turned out differently, but at present Nokri could barely perceive what was happening in real time. It was like a blur, and the undesirable voice that made her ears itch was incomprehensible. Given the dirty rag in her mouth that tasted unwashed and sweaty, though, she had a fair assumption about what was going on. Nokri kicked her legs and aimed a few blows at her assailant, but given she was never a fighter the blows would only leave a light bruise or two at best.

A loud shout caused her to flinch, and Nokri shut her eyes as she continued to thrash. Soon enough though she was picked up and whisked away via horseback. It wasn't Nokri's preferred way of riding. Not in the least. But one gets used to the smell in time, especially if it was something you had to smell every day in the past. Nokri figured this kidnapping had to do with her Drecan appearance - though whether this person was pro-Drecan or against them she wasn't sure - and wondered if she could get out of it by convincing the captor she wasn't Drecan. Maybe some rural accent would do the trick. There wasn't much use struggling on the horse though, and falling off and being trampled by the animal would be less pleasant than the current predicament, so Nokri continued to bear it.

Looking around was basically impossible when they reached the supposed destination. Since the majority of the ride was spent looking down, Nokri also had very little ideas about where they could possibly be. Once taken inside, it took a short minute for Nokri's eyes to adjust. A hastily carved base inside of a cave. *How original.* The feel of this interior gave off a culty vibe, and the people within looked cliquey. Upon being unceremoniously dropped to the ground, she let out a pitiful "oof" that was audible over the gag. Nokri curled up cautiously, staying horizontal to the ground but unreservedly scanning what was visible of the room. She looked blankly up at whoever had taken her with narrowed eyes, any trace of drunkenness now long gone from her system.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-29*

Aldus listens carefully to Desii’s story, it’s the least he can do after all the time she spent looking through that book for ways to help him. The look on Desii’s face combined with the expression of the kidnapped girls father tugs heavily on his heart strings. 

“I can see the conviction in both of you” he turns his attention briefly to Dain “You must love and miss her dearly, you are a good father” he says before turning back to address both of them “Of course we will help look for her.” He tries not to consider the fact that the girl may be fully assimilated by know - depending on the terms of her capture. He wonders briefly if his own father misses him at all before giving himself a resounding *no*. 

“But for tonight we should turn in, get rooms and rest up. We can set out to Trisp in the morning.” Aldus stand up and looks toward the bar for the first time in about an hour. He notes that Nokri is no longer there, just an empty glass left in the place she was sitting. He doesn't feel concerned though *she’s always implying she doesn't need me around, guess she set out to go prove it.*

**Bill** - *2018-03-29*

"Gentlemen" the man in white says, raising his arms to the assembled people in the cave. Said 'gentlemen' chuckle and laugh at being called such. "You were promised a raid; I gave you a raid. You were promised pillaging; I provided you an entire town to pillage. You asked for chaos; and I supplied such. Then you asked for a sacrifice." The man orates. He then kicks Nokri in the stomach.

"I bring you a sacrifice. This heathen is from Dreca, the southern nation of sinners and criminals. Whatever sins you must commit to satisfy your lust for violence, doing so to this slime with be a *service to the light.*" The room laughs at the term, but Nokri can see the rather psychotic grins spread across the 'gentlemen's' faces. One comes up to the balcony level, and the man in white nods to him. The newcomer tossed Nokri over a shoulder and shouts to the room.

"At midnight, we sacrifice the *heathen*, and spill the *heathen's* blood across the floor!" And the room explodes into cheers. The man in white rolls his eyes and turns on his heel down the stairs. 

- - -

Desii smiles. "I appreciate the help. I couldn't refuse after hearing Dain's story." Almost as if on cue, the bartender in question re enters. Desii directs her smile to him, and it spreads to the man. 

"How about a round on the house?" He says. He grabs four mugs from his cupboard and suddenly the door swings open. A middle aged woman with long brown hair charges into the room, collapsing to her knees in the center of the inn. She's wheezing and panting in the worst way, both sounding and looking like she ran a marathon.

"Dain...!" she pants out. "Another...! Enera...! A...Again!" she starts coughing. The bartender has already vaulted the bar and ran to her. 

"Saila, take a breather! We'll fix it, whatever it is, so just breath!" he says worriedly, rubbing the woman's back. It's a minute before she does catch her breath and as soon as she does she continues.

"I saw a young girl get taken, taken by *a man in a white cloak*! Eraia's doing it again Dain, they're taking another daughter from her home!" Dain immediately pulls Saila in close, holding her tight as if she could fade away if he didn't. 

"Did you see who?" Dain says, still holding his wife.

"No, just that she had straw blonde hair in twin braids..." Saila says as she slowly pushes herself out of Dain's embrace. "The man rode off to the east, towards the mountain range, we have to do... do something!" 

"Absolutely Saila." Dain says with a powerful nod. "Lets start by checking the families in town. There were only a few girls with blonde hair in town, once we find whose missing we can coordinate with the parents to rescue her." Saila nods back, and they run out of their inn, completely forgetting your group exists.

Desii is already standing and had been listening intently to the conversation. 

"I'm sorry, but I have to help them with this as well." she says to the two men before her. "They've been so good to me, and to let the same thing that happened to Enera happen to another girl? It'd kill Dain and Saila." Despite her conviction, she seems confused as to what to do as she looks left and right, showing nervous ticks left and right.

"Until they find out who it is... I suppose I could gather the town guard in advance, that would save time..." she mumbles as she puts her things into her sling bag. 

- - - 

Nokri is carried over the man's shoulder like a pig to the slaughter through the dining hall. The assembled 'gentlemen' all lean in as she's carried through the center aisle of tables, laughing and pointing. There's applause as your captor heads down a side passage and you can no longer see the main hall.

The side passage quickly leads to a jail cell set into an alcove of the cave system, which the man tosses you into unceremoniously. He locks the door with a massive key, which is puts on his person.

"Sorry it don't got a plush bed. But we'll be... *upgrading* your accommodations within 24 hours." he sneers. He then leaves and you can hear applause echoing through the cave system again.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

"We shall," Eliran says as he exits the inn and runs to catch up with Dain, "hey dain," he calls out, hoping to get the man's attention, "we'd like to help out!"

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

The three of you catch up with Dain and Saila as he approaches one of the few two story buildings in the town. Judging by the size you imagine it's an assembly hall and as Dain swings open the door your assessment proves sound. The long benches that make up the seating of the hall are pushed against the walls of the hall. Almost two dozen injured lay around the room, swaddled in blankets. It seems the hall has been turned into a field hospital of sorts. It's further confirmed by two women dressed in white walking between the injured parties. 

Dain enters, looks quickly across the room. Saila makes a beeline for a woman you recognize from the square this afternoon; Tamus called her Frin. 

"Frin! We must rally the guard, one of the children has been taken!" Saila calls, still halfway across the room. Frin turns, her face drawn with heavy lines and bags around her eyes.

"Saila... Forgive me for asking, but this is true correct?" Frin asks. "We're stretched so thin right now, there's little to spare for... your issues."

"Frin, I swear to you! On which ever God you'd like!" Saila says, now in front of the older woman. Dain jogs up behind his wife, placing his hands on her shoulders comfortingly. "A man in a white cloak grabbed a girl with twin blonde braids! Which of the girls is wearing her hair that way right now?" Saila says.

Frin closes her eyes and thinks for a moment. "I... I don't think anyone. Do we have any travelers with children in town?"

"No we don't Frin. It has to be a girl from town." Dain says.

"Still... Did anyone else see this? Dain?" The man looks down at the ring on his left hand, resting on his wife's shoulder.

"I... did not. I believe Saila wholeheartedly." Dain says with conviction. Frin smiles, but there's a tinge of sadness in it.

"The first thing to do then is to find all the girls in town... We have little man power, but it can't take more than an hour..." Frin starts. She's interrupted by Saila.

"We can't wait! I saw the man ride east, we must rally the guard and go after her!" Saila says, stepping out of her husband's reach.

"Saila, the guard are the injured men and women around you on the floor! You truly think they're in the condition to aid us?" Frin frowns at Saila. "They fought tooth and nail to keep us safe two nights ago; I shant bother them unless we can confirm the truth!" Frin says, frustration seeping into her tone.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-09*

"The 'child' is not from your town" Aldus says, knowing this statement will probably damn his hope of getting any help in this battle, but it is only the truth. "We have reason to suspect that is is our traveling companion, not a child but a... small woman. We plan to go after her and would welcome any assistance you could give us, though I will understand if you cannot. Even a couple extra hands would help us greatly."

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

Frin looks to Aldus as the Naissankari spoke up. Her eyes widen as he states it is Nokri who was taken. She blinks for a moment, before looking somberly at him.

"That's right... when I saw you before you had a third person with you..." she says quietly. Frin looks to Saila and Dain, then to Desii, Aldus, and Eliran. 

Saila opens her mouth to protest, but Dain places a hand on her shoulder. "I think they're right Saila. It didn't occur to me at the time, but their friend matches your description. She left the bar around the same time no less." Dain adds softly. Saila contemplates Dain's face for a moment before nodding to the man. Frin takes that as the go ahead to continue.

"I'm terribly sorry this happened to your friend." Frin says to Aldus. "This is normally a very safe town, yet with this recent raid we've been left nearly defenseless." Frin sighs heavily. "And in that vein, we cannot provide you any aid, at least not right now. We sent a runner to the kingdom yesterday morning calling for aid in bolstering our defenses. They should be here soon, within 24 hours, but I can't imagine you want to wait that long." Frin adds. 

"If you mark your trail, as soon as the assistance arrives we'll send them after you. With any luck you'll have the support you need in time." Frin looks you in the eyes with a slight nod. "Will that work?"

- - -

Nokri quickly loses track of time. A single feeble torch lights the area, set in the wall across from her cell. There's a table and two chairs underneath it.

Eventually two men come around the bend. They chuckle at Nokri, still with her wrists tied, before sitting down with a deck of cards at the table. They begin to play a familiar game of chance to Nokri, one that's 90% luck if you don't cheat. The one on the right (an averagely build man with a crooked nose) is apparently much luckier than the other (A bearded man with a scimitar).

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

He smiles and scoffs a little as Frin refers to Nokri as his friend, but obviously doesn’t make a point correct her. Aldus purses his lips and considers her last statement for a second “We’ll just have to make it work. We will mark the trail and hopefully with enough luck backup will come in time, quite frankly I don’t know what we are going to face but we will just have to hope for the best and make it work.” He nods to Frin graciously “Thank you for the help and for the promise of reinforcements, I appreciate it… and for what it’s worth I greatly hope your town recovers fully from this.” 

He turns to Eliran “I suppose we should head to get the horses then?”

---

On the way to the stables Aldus briefly considers the odds in this fight, they have no idea what they will uncover in this hideout, no idea what they are truly getting into here. He considers the fact that this little venture could kill him, or worse. *Well, Nokri may not be quite deserving of this good deed, but it’s not like I have anywhere to really go back to anyway. They don’t want or need me at home. At least if I die trying to rescue her, I can say it was with good intentions. Maybe there will be a place for me with the ancestors after all.*  He smiles up the the sky, noting the slowly descending sun, all things considered it’s a beautiful day.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-16*

aaaa000000000000aaaaaamjnAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
KUY

Eliran nodded in response to Aldus, "you grab the horses, I'm going to look at those maps real quick and see if I can narrow down where the bandits might camp. " And he was off. 
---
Later, Eliran joined Aldus by the stables, no longer in his normal travelers clothes. Instead he wore some padded leather, and was holding an odd looking saddle and bow.  Noticing Aldus' somewhat questioning look, he responded, "Just in case we run into some on the way" he said, as if it explained everything. Saddling up, he hopped on his horse with a slight grin, "Now, lets go hunt some bandits and save an asshole."

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

"Ah. In that case, might I ride with you Aldus?" Desii says. "There's only the two horses..." she adds sheepishly.

As you travel east you start to see a path worn into the grasslands, well traveled by foot and by hoof. As you follow the path it starts lead you slightly south, the air becoming more humid as you get closer to where the desert is on the maps. It's the only sign of the desert you see before you approach the mountain side. It's not long after the path fades into the foothills that you see a cave mouth in the side of the rock. Outside is a skull mounted on a pike, which cause Desii to shiver behind Aldus.

"I... imagine that would be the kind of decoration a bandit hideout would have?" Desii says quietly behind Aldus.

- - -

The cell door swings open in front of Nokri. "We have gotten you better accom...*snrk*...accommodations mi'lady." the lead of three bandits snickers. He grabs Nokri by her wrist cuffs, dragging her along behind him. Nokri is able to get her feet beneath her, but not before she gets a few welts from bouncing against the cave walls and even the door to her cell.

Nokri is let back through the main hall, still crowded as ever. There's more jeering and shouting from the crowd. On the entrance platform she can see the man in white, leaning against the wall. Two bandits, one in a particularly funky headband, stand on the platform as well. The man without the head ornament holds a coil of rope in one hand. One end of the rope is tied to the railing of the platform, bordering the drop the main room.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

Aldus swallows hard at the sight of the skull pike. “Yes I would imagine so” he says looking back at Desii where she is seated behind him, feeling her grip on him tighten ever so slightly. He almost wishes he could hold onto to someone as well. “Perhaps we should see if there is another entrance?” he says both to Eliran and Desii. “Hopefully they haven't spotted us yet.”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-19*

Eliran looked down at the map they had, and judged the surrounding area, "yeah lets, I think there should be one over this way," he said, cautiously leading the three around  to the near side of the encampment, looking to see if there was another entrance. As he did this, Eliran drew his bow, gesturing at Aldus and Desii, as if he was suggesting they do the same. As they cautiously approached, Eliran could swear he heard nearby voices of potential bandits. _it looks like we may have found our way in_ he thought to himself

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Nokri was small, sitting upright as best she could balance yet sticking close to herself for warmth. Maybe someone would notice and offer her some respite. Chances were slim, but possible. It was convenient she had the two guards to watch, playing their game of chance. It was funny how obvious the cheater was while his opponent stayed dumbly unaware. 

Her mouth was dry, no thanks to the cloth that kept it propped open and exposed to the air. If these punks were half as considerate as the Drecan military they might grace her with a splash of water sometime in the next 12 hours. Whether that much time had passed since she got there, she wasn't sure. Nokri counted in her head the seconds as they passed but lost count quickly. When that happened she would just start again. Sometimes she could hear voices, and would strain her ears.

*Would be convenient to have that mutt around, with his freakish hearing* she thought briefly, but shook the idea from her head. Was she insane? This place already stunk, it didn't need a laguz. No matter how warm another body would be. She wondered what Eliran was doing. Probably all smug thinking he'd won. Well, Nokri didn't need them. She would be the one laughing in the end.

That is, assuming she didn't meet her end. Resounding footsteps made the room chillier than before. She willed tears to her eyes before the door flung open, the metal bopping her roughly in the nose and tearing some of the skin for being too close. Surely the sight of a little crying girl would stir some feeling in these ruffians?

Apparently not. She got another bumpy joyride across the rough ground, squinting in the brighter light of the main room compared to the darkness of her cell. Some idiot was wearing all white, probably a rich idiot if he could afford to wear such clothing in a dirty cave.  Her stomach churned a little at the rope in his hand.

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Desii nods to Eliran. "I... should say, our meeting this afternoon was pretty much my only combat experience. I'll uh... try not to slow anyone down." she says sheepishly. She preps her tome though, opening to the same lightning spell she used this afternoon. 

Neither Eliran or Desii can make out the exactly words they begin to hear from around the hill. Aldus can make out a few words, but there's so *much* chatter he can't make out any proper sentences. It's not long before you round a boulder and the voices are no longer muffled. You see a cave entrance in a tiny clearing. The small entrance has a fire pit outside it, with a few logs pulled up as seats around it. Despite the trappings of a guard station, no one sits outside the entrance. All the voices echo out from the cave mouth. Looking into the cave, you see it slopes rather sharply downwards. It comes to a corner at the end of slope, turning right.

Around the corner you can see part of a massive room. It's primary features are three long wood tables, running the length of the room. You enter on one of the long sides of the room, towards the back of the room based on the direction everyone is facing. The room is filled with bandits and ruffians, all facing a raised section to the right of your entrance. Stair cases carved into the stone wind from the ends of the wall up to the center platform. A top said platform is a familiar, headache inducing face. Nokri is being held by her wrists, which are tied together, a man twice her size holding her wrists above her head. Next to that man is a man in a white cloak who some how looks bored as the room jeers at your pint sized friend. The last person on the platform holds a rope, which one end of is tied to the railing of the platform. The white cloaked man steps forward. 

"Gentleman." he says without only the slightest hesitation. "In return for your service I offered you fire to burn villages. I offered you easy pickings of an entire town, no guards to stop you." The room cheers. "And I offered you a sacrifice, one you could kill without qualm from I. Here I present you with said sacrifice." The cheering becomes a roar. The white cloaked man sighs visibly. He just nods to the man next to him with the rope. The man with the rope begins to tie it around Nokri's neck as the collected bandits stand and chant, banging their feet on the stone floor and mugs on the tables.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

Nokri kicked her legs, stretching them out to try and touch the ground where she could, but she was held just slightly too high. The feat was difficult when she was also shrugging her shoulders, fighting against the rope being wrapped there. "What did I do?" she shrieked, "I'm innocent." But the words were indistinguishable from gibberish screaming, made further unintelligible from the gag and her dry mouth. Surely someone in the crowd could stop their incessant banging and lend her a hand. The noise was giving her a headache. The bandanna in her hair fell loose but Nokri barely noticed it fall. She resorted to trying to bump into the man holding her, hoping his grip would slacken or at least the dumb cloth in her mouth would also fall out and give her a chance to speak her mind.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-23*

Watching, Eliran sighed, "well we found our rogue friend," he notched arrow. "Heres the plan, desii, use a lightning spell on the crowd, at best you'll hit a good number of them, at worse they'll probably be spooked. I'm gonna shoot the guy about to choke and kill nokri." He looked at Aldus "you got a bow too so how about you focus on picking off the guys coming towards us,and I'll try and kill the guys at the front trying to kill the little asshole." He offered.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-23*

Aldus swallows thickly at the sight of Nokri in binds, although she seems to be  giving these people sass as well, in pure Nokri fashion. As the man speaks Aldus becomes even more uncomfortable. *What the hell is going on here? What does he mean a sacrifice? What kind of weird bandit cult is this?!* he thinks to himself. Normally bandits would be into pillaging and burning villages, but sacrifices? *What are they even sacrificing her to?!* At first he had thought maybe this could be solved with parlay, but now, hearing the way this man speaks he knows these people are truly messed up.  

He swallows again and nods at Eliran., but who he really wants to shoot is the white cloaked man. He holds a finger up, signalling for them to wait a second, and pulls two vials from his belt pouch. "Posion" He explains to Eliran softly, pressing the glass tube into his palm. "use it if you wish" He pops the cork off and dabs the end of a few of his arrows in the green liquid, before recooking and stowing it away again. Then he nocks an arrow and aims at the man in the white cloak, and shoots.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-23*

Eliran raised an eyebrow, "Poison eh?" he considered it, and then applies some to a few of his own arrows. _Can't hurt to have a guarantee_ he figured. As Aldus raised his bow and  fired at the White cloaked man ™ Eliran was slightly frustrated Aldus didn't quite follow his plan, but figured what the heck, they would be able to get off a few arrows before anybody noticed anyways, and either of them could do either role. "fire away," he said under his breath with a slight grin, as he cocked his own poisoned arrow, and fired at the man holding Nokri and the rope.

**Bill** - *2018-04-23*

Desii presses up behind Aldus as they peer into the room. She places one hand against the wall for support, though that's all Aldus can see of the girl. She gasps slightly as she takes in the scene. She presses tighter to Aldus's back, enraptured with the insanity before her.

Aldus alone can see Desii's hand, braced against the wall, shivering slightly. The rest of her frame has no tell, but the green mage can't quell her hand's motion as Eliran gives orders. *"He makes this sound so... routine"* she thinks idly. She takes a step back from Aldus as the Naissankari draws his own bow. She looks between the two, then to the tome in her off hand. 

"I've... never even fought one person..." she says quietly with wide eyes as the two men before her dip their arrows in poison. Her hand quivers more visibly, and she grabs her off wrist with her other hand, pulling her tome to her chest. 

- - - 

The man ties the last of the knot around Nokri's neck and jeers. He lifts her up by her tied wrists again, holding her up like a fish on a skewer in front of the crowd. The pounding of beer steins becomes omniously synchronized, pounding to a building rhythm. The white cloaked man steps forward again. He comes up to Nokri.

"May Lylalel bless thee as you head to the next life. While your nation is one of sinners and criminals, may you realize the err of your ways as she pulls you from this plane to her own, lest you end up in the endless hell of Lyarlel's jaws." he says routinely. He then turns Nokri's head towards him.

"You hold no fault in this, aside from fighting for the wrong side. I pity you. Had you not come to town today, you'd have never ended up in this situation." he says. "It's... odd. I'd thought you had companions. I expected a fight taking you, not one that I couldn't win mind you, but a fight none the less. I suppose the old saying is true, and there is no honor among sinners."

His voice gets even quieter. "Take heart. Your death has paid a debt taken by Lylalel's guided few, and will serve a much greater purpose. That is more than a sinner like you could ever ask for, is it not?" he says. His eyes are cold as they bore into Nokri's, deep blue with naught a highlight in them. If you were not dangling a rope's length from death already, it'd send a shiver down your spine. 

- - - 

Desii watches the two take aim, eyes frantically going from them to the crowd. The crowd was thirsty for blood, not noticing the archers. She was supposed to lighting them, that's right. Use... the power of the elements on them... Desii slips out of the crouch she was in, falling to her side. 

*"It's not supposed to be that easy..."* her heart cries to her. But her eyes fall on Nokri, behind hefted over the side of the railing. *"I can't let that happen either...!"* and Desii spins her knees under her. She flips through her spell book with a fervor in her eye. *"It's not lighting... but that'll work!"* she says, slamming her hand down on an open page. She stands, stepping to Aldus's left and starts speaking the nonsensical language of magic with practiced ease. The words, for lack of a better term, fly from her mouth as a circle of runes appears below her, the mark of a continuous effect spell.

The dust in the circle around Desii's feet spins, picking up speed quickly as the air around her spirals. It builds as Eliran sights his arrow, and just before the release Desii unbottles the flow. The wind storm rushes out into the room, slamming the nearest table into the center one, and everyone sitting at it across the room. Chairs fly about, beaning a few bandits in the head. The gale of wind keeps up beyond the initial burst, not as strong as the opening wave but strong enough to make approach difficult. In the center of the circle Desii keeps up the casting, sweat dripping from her bangs yes still speaking the language of runes as if it were Theanovene common.

- - -

The banging reaches a fevered pitch. The man holding Nokri lifts her over the railing, to the gutteral roar of the crowd and the twang of a pair of bows. The white cloaked man notices the arrow at the last moment, shifting just enough to take the arrow to his arm and not his heart. The man holding Nokri was not so skilled. Eliran's arrow pierces his heart, and the man looks down slowly as the room falls silent. His lip twitches wildly, blood slipping from the corners. His hand inches open, one last act, and Nokri slips out of his grip. 

(ooc: Nokri is falling. You all have the chance to come up with a way to save her from her neck snapping. You don't have to get her loose, as long as something interrupts her fall she'll be able to hang there choking for a little bit. (So much better, I'm sure.) )

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-25*

He notes Desi’s hand shaking where it is placed against the stone. *Is she bracing herself?* when she mentions never having fought before, Aldus feels a slight ache for  her innocence. 


The people in the room revel loudly in celebration of the deed their apparent leader is about to commit, spouting some nonsense about Lylalel, and sacrifices, and sinners. Aldus thinks if Lylalel is the type of goddess to demand for such a thing, then she isn’t one he could ever justify following. *At least my weird dead ancestors don’t ask for sacrifices in the forms of young women” He ponders for a moment. 


As the white cloaked man turns his attention on Nokri once again, Aldus finds himself focusing in on her face, trying to read what she may be feeling. Her face is stern and cold as usual, but somewhere in those icy blue eyes is an emotion that doesn't suit her brave visage - fear. 


He grits his teeth as a light snarl escapes his lips, something almost animalistic rises up within him, something *protective*? He wasn't particularly fond of Nokri but… was she part of his new “pack”?  He barely knows her. Why is he feeling this *need* to defend her? No time to consider that now. 


At the moment he released his bow string, a storm spawned from Desii. Wind whipped and chairs flew and chaos was rampant throughout the room. Aldus had never seen anything like it before, but then again he wasn't well versed in magical knowledge or experience. 


Pulling back from the distraction he sees his arrow land in white cloaked man's arm, at least the target was hit, he sees Elirans target was hit also, more precisely than his own but now, Nokri is falling?

Aldus gasps as time comes to a halt in his mind. He feels his mouth open in a silent scream, his lips forming the word “No” but he doesn’t *hear* anything. Men and women are turning to the three of them now.

And then he’s on the move, his legs propelling him forward without his permission. He reaches to his quiver, fist closing around a hand full of pre-coated arrows that he deftly places in between his fingers on his right hand and fires in quick succession at the three most dangerous looking people at the table that runs down the center of the room. The table he is now leaping onto and bounding down. Taking advantage of the chaos in the room he fires another arrow up at the white cloaked man. At this point Aldus is spurred on by pure instinct, instinct he isn’t sure he trusts. 


He shoulders his bow and leaps off the far end of the table holding his arms out and bracing for Nokri’s weight.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-26*

Eliran is focused, or he was, until the room filled with wind. He looked over to an unsteady Desii, who had just confessed to never fighting before, and realized that attack magic would probably just unnerve and mess with the naive girl, especially the kind of spell that could hurt so many he had asked for.  He looked to her sympathetically one last time before loosing his arrow and watching it strike its target.

And causing Nokri to fall.

_Shit_ he thought to himself, as he quickly notched a second arrow aiming this time for the rope so he could prevent the neck breaking a hanging from that height would surely cause. At the same time, he heard a bellow come from his compatriot, who immediately started to charge the room, as he loosed the arrow, Eliran only hoped Aldus would get to her in time. 

His mind was racing now, watching Aldus dash through the crowd, Eliran knew he couldn't stay still. He looked at Desii, who seemed to still be focused on casting her wind spell, something that would only make aiming more difficult, unless....

"Desii" he called to her, "Do you have a spell that give us a wall of air and push enemies away?" He asked as he started firing arrows at the four people closest to Aldus's position after seeing the laguz jump to catch Nokri. If she did,  Eliran figured it would let him focus on keeping the goons off his friend's back, and make defending their position much easier. _Lets hope this works_

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-04-26*

Nokri had been a little apprehensive up until that point. But she was convinced they'd let her go eventually. Maybe this was all some weird ceremonial joke they play, and they'd ransom her off elsewhere or return her to Dreca. Maybe these guys have freakish kinks about seeing adorable innocent girls treated like dirt. But the rope tightening around her larynx sent a jolt of terror through her mind. Honest tears started pouring from her eyes, blurring her already limited vision.

She continued shaking in an attempt to fight back, somehow comprehending the man's words yet not listening at all. Time was going so slowly, and it felt like she was staring into his eyes for an eternity. The noise below grew louder, and Nokri went limp. This really was it then. She had seen people hanged a hundred times, and she had examined the knots. The one around her was sure to hold, and if it didn't then the shock of hitting the ground while tied up would sure finish her off.

There was some kind of stirring going on below, but she was too blind to see. A *thwp* noise sped past her and suddenly she fell.

She wanted it over quick. Her parents and the Drecan government already believed her to be dead with the rest of her original military platoon. Plus, that would have been an honorable way to go, in battle. Those she had met in Theanovene saw hundreds of people each day, and she barely made an impact in the timeline of their lives. The only people that ever paid her a sideways glance was the curly haired musician and the dog, and even they despised her.

*They were right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.* With her last moments she thought of them and their kindness towards her undeserving self. No one in Dreca had ever shown her such warmth. No one on the streets had ever treated her like a companion. She hoped they achieved their goals,. If there was a god hopefully he could guide them.

Tears trailed behind her as she fell limply, ready for her neck to snap and feeling to fade away. As the noose tightened, something came at her from the side. She sputtered as her airways were forcibly constricted, unable to breathe in, yet somehow she was still conscious. The shouting down here was different, more chaotic than rhythmic like it was before. Something was wrong. Was she already dead?


A familiar shade of white caught the corner of her eye. *I'm hallucinating,* she concluded. More arrows whizzed by and more people shouted. Their anger seemed directed at two familiar green and brown heads on the opposite wall. She wanted to shout to them, to see if they were real, but it was impossible. Facing downwards, tears once more started blotting her vision. Maybe an angel had come to take her spirit away and took the form of the laguz. Her eyes rolled up into the back of her head, followed by her blacking out and going limp.

**Bill** - *2018-04-26*

The bandits in the room are more than aware of your presence in the tunnel now. Most seem to be unarmed, a savings grace to your group, yet you're hard pressed to find a scrawny man in the room. They flip the closest table to your entrance over on it's side, using the top of the table as a buffer against Desii's gale. The winds die down before reaching the other side of the room though, leaving all of the men on the platform side of the room itching to get at the archer blazing past them. Others run out into the other exits of the room, shouting unintelligibly to their companions. 

The man in the cloak surveys the chaos in the room without so much as a batted eye. He does focus his attention on the archer below him as he yanks the arrow from his shoulder. Rather than reach for the blade at his hip he bends down, pulling out a book from a pack on the ground. He avoids Aldus's second arrow in this fashion, it clattering against the wall behind him. 

The man opens the book and begins the familiar action of spell casting. He snarls the last of the incantation and a surge of flame pours out over the railing. The hellish waterfall falls over Aldus and Nokri, the consistent stream splitting into wisps as it falls, giving the appearance of snowflakes of fire falling over the two of them, and every bandit approaching them. The man seems to have no care for friendly fire, the demonic hailstorm hitting both friend and ally.

(ooc: Nokri is saved...! Whether we're happy about it or not. 😛 She is currently in Aldus's arms, and as long as she stays so she'll have nothing to worry about from the rope. If Aldus drops her before she gets loose of the rope, she'll be able to hang there for a while, the risk then being eventual suffocation rather than a snapped neck. You know, in case you don't want to let her down right away.

Remember you have pretty much carte blanche to do what you want as far as bandit combat. Write your own kick ass battle, or get your ass handed to you. It's worked a lot better when I give you the freedom to write your own combat story, outside of the FOEs. You can add things to the fight to make it more challenging for your and your allies 'a guy comes up with a slingshot and start shooting at Desii!' and now I have to deal with that as Desii's player. Have fun with it, golden rule.)

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

Just before Nokri’s weight hits his body in full force he swears he can feel a few drops of wetness hit him. *tears?! She’s actually crying? Oh this must be bad.* And then she’s in his arms. He thought he’d expect the weight but the momentum she gained on her way down takes hims by surprise, he stumbles slightly before regaining his footing. 

Looking down at Nokri he can see she has *once again* been knocked unconscious. He doesn't have time to consider this fact right away as almost instantly a wall of flame descends over him and Nokri alike, He needs to get out of its way but Nokri is still attached to the rope. He deftly shifts Nokris weight to one arm, reaches to his boot dagger, and severs the tie, leaving him free to back up flush against the wall. As his back hits the wall he feels a burning sensation in his foot, looking down he can see his boot aflame from the cloaked mans spell, but the flame dies quickly leaving his foot in pain, but no longer on fire.

It is then that the weight of what has just happened begins to occur to Aldus. “Shit, shit, shit,shit, What did I do?! What are we gonna do?!” He asks the young woman in his arms, as if she can even hear him.“This would be a great time for you finally make yourself useful you know!” He says with a panicked anger down at the woman. The anger fades quickly though as he notices the burn marks peeking out behind the ropes on her wrists and neck. Soon he finds himself instead begging in a small voice “please wake up, please wake up”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-30*

Eliran watches as Aldus catches nokri, _well that's one thing solved..._ he thought as a sudden set of flames bloomed from the mage up top in their direction _seriously??_ 

He looked at Desii, "you holding up okay?" He called over the sound of her wind spell, he knew she was probably a little overwhelmed. Looking over the room, he debated what he should do, watching the table with bandits hiding behind it. As two of them stuck their heads out, to check, Eliran quickly whipped out two arrows, one for each of the villains. 
His gaze returned to Aldus' position, seeing his lagu buddy surrounded and with an unconscious nokri, he figured some covering fire would help. Drawing two of the poison arrows he prepared with Aldus' concoction, he fired at the white mage, aiming for the Magicians heart and upper right thigh.  
--- 
While Eliran was firing at the various bandits, he also called out several times to desi, first to ask if she was ok, but once more to ask if she could activate any other spells, perhaps something that could at least knock some of the bandit crowd near them out?.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-04-30*

Within seconds of fainting, her eyes fluttered open and she became conscious again. A scorching heat was closing in, thinning the air around them, yet Nokri was able to take a gulp of air. The noose now loosened, she noticed this was definitely not death. Maybe h*ll (ooc: censored owo) on Aurii, but not the black void of eternal nothingness she wished for. She breathed in deeply, shutting her eyes and focusing on just inhaling.

Flames danced along the ropes on her wrists before dying out, noticeably weakening the hemp's constitution and singeing her skin. Eliran's voice echoed around the walls, filling Nokri with curiosity. *No way. No way no way. No. Can't be them. Can't be.* But sure enough, a very familiar voice began shouting at her, almost furiously. Then, furiosity turned to... desperation? Opening her heavy eyelids, Nokri looked up. A kind, familiar face. Just like she imagined. She got teary again. It didn't matter if they saw her crying like a child, she didn't care about her appearance anymore, not that she was exactly the image of beauty in that moment.

With whatever brute strength she had left, Nokri fought to break the rope at her wrist. What had been originally impossible was made much easier from the flames and after 4 or 5 tugs the cuff finally snapped. She then clawed at the cloth in her mouth, spitting the disgusting rag onto the ground where it would hopefully curl up and burn in the remaining flames. "Aldus?" she coughed, barely more than a whisper with her mouth as dry as a desert. Without waiting for an answer, she flung her arms around him in a tight embrace. Something that real was definitely not a hallucination.

She had many questions, but no time or power to ask. Through tear-streaked eyes she frantically looked around. A pile of cave debris with several hefty rocks lay nearby, a messy table. With a useless voice, she grabbed Aldus's wrist and pulled him along behind her towards the pile, dodging stray projectiles. Kneeling down to use the table as protection, Nokri picked up a particularly pointy rock and chucked it at the nearest foe. She didn't wait to see if it hit before reaching for another, and another, tossing stones any which way to defend Eliran and Desii.

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Desii blinks a bead of sweat from her eyelash. She can feel the magic following her bidding, the same way it did when she practiced at home. Yet as her heart pounds and her eyes dart in every direction looking for a man to bust through her spell she can feel the familiarity slipping. Her frame of mind changes, warping the spell she's so used to crafting. The image of spinning, twisting and moving slips in her mind's eyes and the spell circle fades in response. Despite her best effort she looses the spell completely. It dies in a trickle, not even a final burst. 

"Guh!" Desii sputters, resting one hand on her knee as she exhales heavily. Looking her feet for a moment was enough for the first bandit to come over the table, sprinting at her with a yell. Desii tries to hop backwards, her book closed and pressed against her chest. She stumbles over her own feet though, falling flat on her back.

Her legs fly upwards as she hit the stone floor with a loud groan, making contact with the man's groin. He freezes in place as if Desii cast an ice spell before rigidly collapsing to the side. Desii rolls on to her hands and knees, scrambling to her feet. All the while her mind is acknowledging the surrealism of tripping as a form of combat maneuver. "*If that's the case, I have more training than everyone here combined...*" Her thoughts comment dryly before she turns on her heel and opens her book again. 

Desii takes a page out of the enemy caster's book, casting the same wisping fire spell as he did not a moment before. The wisps of flame spray over the ground between the bandits and herself, turning it into a minefield of flame. She flips quickly through her book looking for her next spell, knowing without fuel the fires will die in a few moments.

The white magician steps backwards, removing himself from Nokri and Aldus's sight. He watches the enemy mage falter in their spell craft and sees on the men rush her. *"Good"* was the only thought to cross him mind as he took in the rest of the room. Was this much chaos seriously caused by a dog, and archer, and a mage? He had to admit each seemed impressive, but reality was no story book. There are no heroes on white horses. 

He cracks open his spell book again. With a flurry of words in the tongue of magic a page burns from the book. A sphere of flame at least 3 feet in diameter appears in the air over the banister. It spins as the mage casts the last of the spell, as if it were being wound up. As the spell finished the ball floats down to the ground, rolling right for Eliran and Desii.

Men start returning from the tunnels, carrying bundles of weapons of every type. They slide to the rest of their allies behind cover, assumably to distribute their cargo.

(ooc: The White Cloaked Man has been defeated. Ya'll narrate his defeat. Also throwing the ever present reminder that you can succeed an encounter without killing everything, the goal for the encounter is to 'survive and rescue'.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-03*

As Elirans arrow struck the cloaked man, he grinned. While the man was agile enough to avoid earlier arrows, his focus on maintaining spells clearly distracted him enough for one to slip through. Eliran  watched as the man staggered back slightly and looked at the arrow lodged in his chest, before taking a step forward as if to steady himself, and then falling over the ledge due to the poison robbing him of whatever control he had left. 
---- 
Eliran couldn't celebrate the victory for long however, the room was slowly filling with more and more bandits, and soon he and his friends would be over run if they weren't careful, "The Magician is Dead! Fall back!!!" He cried out at the top of his lungs, hoping the news may stagger the enemies morale, and that Aldus would retreat with nokri so they could escape. He pulled a few arrows out of his bow, firing at three incoming bandits.  Like he thought, his position with Desii was slowly starting to be over-run. 
"Desii, can you clear a path for Aldus and Nokri with your magic?" He asked as he started to back up to gain a bit more distance.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

He watches as Nokri’s eyelids flutter, and then she struggles as she removes the bindings on her wrists. He immediately breathes a sigh of relief and starts thinking of what to do next, to get them out of this insane situation. She coughs out his name, and he takes a moment to consider weather or not she's ever called him bye it and not ‘dog’ or some other less colorful name. 

Suddenly, small arms are around his neck and she's… *hugging* him? *Today is a very strange day* He thinks to himself, in fact most days have been strange since the sassy blonde entered his life. He gives her a tight, yet brief squeeze back. If feels strange, awkward, but good, As if he hasn't touched another person in ages, despite it only being a few months at most. They pull apart and Aldus notes the tears in her eyes and she turns, running for cover while slinging rocks in their enemy’s direction. 

He darts after her, firing off a few arrows at close targets. Just then Eliran’s arrow flies overhead hitting the magician and sending him reeling over in pain and paralysis. Elirans voice cuts through the din, directing them to retreat. “Fine by me, lets get the hell out of here” he says to himself. Aldus back peddles, continuing to fire arrows at whichever targets appeal to him and makes his way back across the chaos to where Eliran and Desii are.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

Relying on pure adrenaline and the desperation of a caged animal fighting for its life, Nokri continued pelting stones at anything that moved. The vast majority of them did absolutely nothing. Occasionally, one would provide a distraction wherein the target would stop advancing and look up, only to get struck by an ensuing arrow in their hesitation. Once, a stone hit someone in the eye. That was a nice shot. But celebration would have to wait.

Eliran and Desii were in her sights, but getting to them would be difficult. The fighting seemed to be dying down though, as fighters began to realize their leader was out of commission. Nokri wanted nothing more than to go and kick the filthy white-robed clod laying in a heap on the ground to confirm his pathetic death, but knew better than to backtrack. A miracle wouldn't happen again if they caught her a second time.

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

Desii looks quickly to Eliran as he shouts to her. She glances to the fire wisps in front of her and makes a quick call. She spins on one heel, slipping slightly. She thrusts her hand forward and lightning flies from it, arcing in every which way. It branches off as it passes men with metal blades, striking their weapons. One man with a metal chain around his neck gets hit, spasming before hitting the floor. Desii looks away from him, to the others who stand holding their burned hands. The spell slows some of the bandits approach but for every man holding a weapon another holds no metal, leaving him unaffected by the spell.

The white cloaked man drops to the floor with a clunk. The rest of the room doesn't seem to even notice him, one man even tramples him as he runs towards Aldus.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

As the white cloaked man falls to the floor Aldus wonders weather or not Eliran has really killed the man or simply knocked him out. *I hope it's the former* Aldus's eyes widen slightly at his own dark thought as a man charges at him with a short sword. Aldus scoffs at the man's unpracticed style and deftly catches the swinging blade between the pointed knock and lower limb if his bow, flinging the man's weapon away. He follows this with a swift kick to the man's chest - knocking him over.  

Aldus shoulders his bow, and bends to reclaim his dagger from his boot. He keeps it tucked close to his chest as he grabs Nokri's arm with the other hand. Gently, but with urgency he guides her to the other two, avoiding oncoming attacks, or shieding her from them. 

"We should probably get out of here.... Now." he says to them, huffing slightly from exasperation.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-10*

Nokri would have liked to spit on their cloaked enemy after he fell, but she was too dehydrated. She blamed that as being part of their evil plan, denying her of water for exactly this purpose should this eventuality have occurred. Cunning.

The static in the air from Desii's lightning made her hair stand on end. While everyone else looked like a cool action hero, Nokri resembled more of a startled, feral echidna. She pulled back her arm to chuck another stone at random, accidentally almost punching Aldus in the nose. The only thing that made her halt was the zap of static shock and the *snap* sound that happened when he took hold of her arm. In less tense situations it may have elicited laughter. Or anger. Perhaps a mix of both.

They made it to the rest of the party, where everyone was in unique stages of dishevelment and exhaustion. "Do you know the way out?" Nokri tried to ask, her voice a barely discernible rasp.  She peered behind them towards what - she assumed - was an exit, but had no way of knowing for sure. The path seemed clear and they might be able to make a run for it, but stray foes were still mucking about and aiming for their lives.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-10*

"Backwards" Eliran said, jerking his head towards the exit they came in, "let's go quick." His words were short, as was his breath, paying little heed to nokri beyond noticing her presence and question. As he started shifting his targets to the nearby ruffians, hitting anybody who came close, the sweat was clear on his furrowed brow "I don't want to run out of arrows before we escape."

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Desii felt adrenaline surge through her as she watched men drop their blades and clutch their shocked limbs. It was an odd feeling, she decided. She was in a panic before, desperate not to hurt anyone, but now that she's in the thick of things it's the last thing on her mind. Everything is in the moment, from each spell she's cast to every movement she's made. Combat magic has none of the forethought she's used to; instead she relies on her muscle memory and practiced skills to guide her motions. Her mind is far too occupied with scanning the room, looking for the next person who might have a chance at assaulting her. 

Using magic for combat is unbalancing; a single mage can do twice that of swordsman. A voice, perhaps logic, speaks up in her head reminding her that bandits who live in caves are far different than any classically trained soldier. Her in the moment mentality ignores the statement, happy to take some confidence from the fact her spell craft puts her above the rest of the room. 

Desii turns the page of her spellbook, letting it turn to ash as fire springs from her hand. She directs it towards the overturned table, tracing the bandit's cover position with the flame. The table catches fire, and her efforts of in spreading her attack across the table pay off. The table is now a wall of flame, powered not by magic but by the wood of the table. She can hear bandits scream and scrabble away from it over the crackling flames. She takes comfort from the fact they'd have plenty of time to see the flames wrap from the front to the back of the table, meaning none of them were instantly immolated. Another voice in the back of her mind points out it's quite possible the fire spread to them faster than they could move from. Desii ignores it.

Desii catches her companions chatter a short way behind her, looking over one shoulder to point her ears in their direction. She bobs her head, her hair dripping sweat onto her shoulder as she does. She goes to turn the rest of her body after her head but stumbles over her feet as she turns. She twists and falls, landing on her side with a thunk. She groans and reaches for her spellbook before she feels a rush from the bandits side of the hall. She quickly twists onto her back, holding her tome tightly to her chest with both arms as a bandit comes running at her, powersliding on his knees towards her. 

Desii lets out a decidely not badass shriek as panic outweighs the adrenaline in her system. She pulls both her knees up and kicks desperately, knocking the man in the chest. He loses his momentum and grimaces in pain, but resumes coming towards Desii on his knees, his blade shining in the dim light. Desii pushes herself backwards with her feet, the stone floor rough on her back as she doesn't even think to sit up.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

Just as Aldus starts to turn toward the exit he's blindsided by a burly man tackling him to the ground, his boot dagger flies out of his hand and clatters across the floor, just out of his reach. His face twists in a strained expression as his arm and fingers stretch past the point of comfort, attempting to reach it. The burly man snaps Aldus's attention back to the task as hand with a swift jab to the face. Aldus abandons his goal of reaching his dagger and wiggles out from under the weight of the heavier man. He doesn't completely free himself before the man interrupts him, pulling him back so he's in prime position for a pulverizing.

"Where do you think your going, little puppy?" the man says in a deep gruff voice "Why don't you show me some of that canine brute strength I hear so much about" The man smiles a toothy, -or not so toothy actually- and yellow grin at Aldus, causing him to gag on the strong, rotten smell emerging from the mans mouth. 

"Ancestors man! Haven't you ever heard of mint leaves!?" His retort distracting the man while he reaches a free fist into a different belt pouch he had accessed before. His hand closes around a fist full of small pointed leaves. He spits into the mans eye causing him to rear back just enough for Aldus to get full motion again as he swiftly shoves a fistful of mint leaves into the mans mouth. "Here try some!" 

With the man now completely distracted  and gagging on the floor he stumbles toward the rest of the group, regains his footing and heads to toward the exit "Come on, lets go!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-14*

Eliran looked at the remaining enemies, _no need to worry about finishing off the dregs now is there_ he thought to himself.
He then hears a loud shriek, jerking his head around, he sees Desii kick a man off her _oof that looked like it hurt._ Eliran starts to head over and help her, until he saw her drop a tome on the man's head. _Well that works_ he thought to himself.  He turns and sees Aldus shove a fistful of... something into a man's mouth. _that will be a nice ending to a song_ he mused, already pondering how he'll tell the tail of a magician, a musician, and a lagu raiding a fully armed bandit encampment. 
Hearing Aldus' call to go, snaps out of his thoughts, and starts to dash, heading for the horses to get on and go go go.

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

The bandit Desii put her boot prints on crawls forward as the young mage inches back further and further. Her eyes widen with panic as her back comes in contact with wall. 

"I ain't falling for the same thing twice...!" the bandit grunts as he leaps forward. He pins Desii's legs between his own, leaving him kneeling over her legs as she attempts to kick them loose. This time her magic reliant life style doesn't come to her aid, as she can't move his legs an inch. 

"Now, That electric shock crap was terribly mean girly. I'd like to have you pay for that." he says. He sounds more grumpy than threatening yet the green "combat" mage failed to notice. She cries out, the scream echoing throughout the hall. 

"Can. you. not?!" The bandit growls, pulling a ratty cloth from his pocket and shoving it in Desii's mouth. Silenced, she stares doe eyed at the bandit who just shrugs. He reaches down and starts looting through her bag. Desii clutches her book tighter to her chest as he does, watching fearfully. He seems unsatisfied with the bag and places it to the side, before reaching down towards her pockets. 

"Oh, smart. Really should carry valuable on your person." he mumbles as he does. Desii chooses that moment to flip out, and seemingly realize she has a 14 pound leather bound tome in her arms. She raises the book over her head with a muffled screech and slams it onto the bandit's head. She keeps screching into the clothing and smashing the book down onto his head pummeling until she's completely out of breath.

Wheezing, she looks frantically at the bandit and brings her book up in front of her face to block an envitable counter attack. When none comes, she peers over the top of the tome. The mans had slumped forward, draping over her left leg like a human blanket. She wiggles her left knee, which press into the man's gut. The only resistance she feels to the movement is gravity. 

Desii blinks twice. As she can feel a sigh boil up her throat, she hears a noise. She drops her book on his head again while she pulls herself out from under his form. She continues screaming into the gag as she grabs her bag and slings it over her shoulder and picks up her book. She takes a deep breath as she bolts towards the exit, only to trip on top of a bandit writing on the floor with leaves of some kind in his mouth. She falls book first, the book slamming into his head as well. Desii quickly gets to her feet at a sprint, heading straight for the tunnel. She only thinks to remove the gag from her mouth as runs straight past Aldus.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

A small mass of brown and white flies past him, that he assumes can only be Desii. Eliran is already ahead of him as well. 

But Nokri… with most of the bandits incapacitated he doubles back and stops in front of her. “Nokri come on, let's go! Desii and Eliran are waiting for us! The worst is over now, I promise.” He takes her hand yet again and pulls her toward the exit, meeting up with the other two back outside. 

With a moment to breath he releases Nokri’s hand and places his own hands on his knees, kneeling and catching his breath. After a minute he looks up at her and says with heavy breaths “You. Owe. Me. You owe all of us.”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-17*

Standing by their horses Eliran looks at the group, everybody is clearly tired, exhausted, and bruised, but nobody seemed dangerously injured or anything, so things went pretty damn well in his book.
 He looks at Aldus, who was panting, _well were safe for now at least_. He thought to himself. _any longer and we'd have been the dead ones_ shivering at the thought, Eliran quickly went from fight to flight mode, interjecting in Aldus' and Nokris conversation. 
"We'll talk about dues later, let's get out of here. We may have killed and disabled a solid 20 or so people in there, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's more somewhere nearby." He says, bringing a horse up to Aldus and Nokri, first helping Nokri get on the horse, then going over to help Desii get on hers. "I won't feel safe till we get back to town and see the reinforcements they said were supposed to arrive." He added.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-17*

Continuing her new signature skill, pebble pelt, Nokri chucked a few stones at the foe impending over Desii. Just like all the impeccably aimed shots up until that point, the foe barely noticed a thing and it was as effective as a pesky gnat. Nokri moved to help her up but the girl was already on her feet, screaming and running away. The shrill sound sent throbbing pain through her head and Nokri decided against pursing to make sure she was ok. By the way the girl ran, she was probably fine. 

Nokri was lucky to be able to avoid the wrath of their pursuers. When one started approaching, they were taken down by one of her allies. Aldus had quite the impressive move, pulling some leaves out of his pouch and using them for offense. *Where did he get those? Maybe if I ask later he can share a few.* She would feel decisively more comfortable with some familiar herbs at her disposal.

She went to take a closer look at the floral firearm but instead was yanked towards the exit, a slight pout on her face though she agreed that running would be for the best. Outside, Nokri squinted in the light. The fresh air was a great welcome after being trapped in the stuffy, smelly caverns. Despite just nearly dying and having adrenaline pumping through every vein, Nokri looked rather nonchalant. Usually, Nokri would never repay a favor if she hadn't asked for it, and would ordinarily have scoffed at Aldus. But this time she silently nodded in agreement, extremely thankful for the first time in her life to be alive. "Why did you come here?" she asked quietly, not disdainfully but in a truly curious tone. "and... does, um... anybody have water?" Some hydration might make her voice more perceptible and allow her to sit on the horse without classically passing out again.

Desii is panting heavily, hunched over with her hands on her knees as the last of the group catches up. She turns quickly, almost slipping on her right foot as she does before steading herself. Her hair bobs lightly from the motion as her eyes dart between her allies faces.

Satisfied Eliran wasn't another bandit, nor Aldus or Nokri, she breaths out deeply. She then peers into the cave, looking for pursuers as Eliran asides Aldus and Nokri onto one of the horses. She watches the tunnel intently until Eliran brings her horse over to her. She jumps a little as he approaches, the adrenaline still pumping through her. She smiles sheepishly in apologize at the archer before accepting his help climbing into the saddle. She glances over her shoulder one last time before they ride away, waiting for the cave to erupt with pursuers.

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

The four of you can hear a few shouts echo up from the cave mouth as you spur your horses away from the mountains. As you pass the front entrance, you see a few of the bandits rushing out of that entrance as well. It's much too far from the road for them to catch up to you though, without even counting in your horses. While they shout obscenities and death threats at you they can do nothing to catch you and you successfully leave the camp behind.

Your horses pound away on the dirt road for what feels like forever, though it can't be more than 10 minutes. The horses eventually give up their frantic gallop, the adrenaline both you and the animals felt long passed. The deafening sound of hooves fades to a background noise, allowing you to hear more than your own thoughts.

Bringing her horse to a slow stop, Dizzy makes her way off her horse. She's slow, but she manages to slide off feet first for her efforts. Her pack swings around and she rummages for a small box in it. Desii approaches Aldus and Nokri and waits for the smaller girl to get off the horse. She looks on sheepishly as Nokri disembarks; the thought to help crosses her mind but she's worried she'd do more harm than good.

Sitting on her knees next to Nokri, Desii opens the box to reveal a few bottles of poultices and bandages.

"Go and ahead and set down, with your legs out. Or were your legs not hurt? Well, I can see a variety of things to start with..." Desii says absently mindedly. Her hands move with purpose, her speed pulling mixtures and bandages from the kit belay hours of practice at doing so. She doesn't look at the contents once, knowing where each item is from memory. She's quick at applying it to Nokri as well, doing so with a light touch that's not intrustive or uncomfortable at all.

Desii's bedside manner is a tad lacking though. She murmurs various musing to herself as she works, her eyes darting all over Nokri's body for more spots to treat. She doesn't speak to Nokri as she works either, nor explain what the poultice she's applying is for.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-23*

Nokri disembarked from the steed first with all the grace of a cat wearing socks, kicking up a minor dust storm by her feet as she lands and walked over to the patch of ground she deems least dirty. She eyed Desii somewhat warily, curious as to the box in her hands. A typical first aid kit. Cute. The girl wants to play doctor. Whatever, as long as she can sit Nokri doesn't care.

The girl's fussing gets on her nerves though. She opens and closes her mouth a few times like a fish, wanting to interrupt. *Not there. It's not even badly wounded. Why are you wrapping it like that? It's going to fall off. There is* way *too much salve under that bandage. What a waste.* Finally, her patience wears too thin. "Stop. Stop it, give me that. Do you even know what you're doing?" Amateur. Snatching the bandage and a bottle of poultice from the box, Nokri turned away with her back facing Desii. She raised the bottle up to get a better look at its contents. *Feh, I could make better.*

"We need water," she commented saltily. Preferably fresh, to drink and wash with. Nokri tried spitting onto her hand to rub the grime on her neck away but she was still too dehydrated. She scratched at her neck with a random leaf instead.  "What's our overall damage? Any broken bones? Crushed lungs? If we have to amputate we're going to need water for that too." A lame joke that was her attempt at avoiding real issues. She was still curious. How did they find her, and why? Weren't they going to leave her behind? They certainly hadn't parted on a good note. While Nokri was still iffy about Desii, she was certainly glad to be reunited with Aldus and Eliran, but for how long?

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

Aldus watches as Desii begins to treat Nokri’s injuries with a method and attention to detail that the blonde girl did not exhibit herself when she had attempted to treat Aldus’s own wounds weeks earlier. And she was so organized too! All her potions and poultices in an easy to access location Aldus is given new peace of mind knowing someone more capable was now prepared to treat him should the situation arise. 

Aldus is hardly surprised by Nokri’s little outburst. Rolling his eyes he drops graciously from the horse they had been sharing and saunters over to the two small women on the ground. 

“It would appear to me that she does indeed, know what she is doing, but I see you are as ungrateful for help as usual.” He turns his gaze away from the two of them as he reaches into his pack, extracting a waterskin and drops it on the ground next to the irritated woman. “As far as wounds go I am fine and should Eliran need help im sure Desii can take care of it. You’ve done little to prove yourself as the healer you claim to be, but Desii here has already proven her worth in less than one day with us. She does not deserve your nagging” His brows knit together in frustration as he looks again at the girl that he just risked life and limb for, questioning himself again. “I suggest you take some time to evaluate the events of the not only the past day but the past few weeks and seriously consider cleaning up your act. Our fount of undeserved kindness is bound to run out on you, unless you realise that there are people who would care for you if you would let them.” He turns on his heel making for a copse of trees nearby. Then pauses and turns back on the group for a second. “I’m going to take a walk, I’ll be back before we depart again”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-24*

Eliran heard Nokri's outburst as he hopped off his horse,  rolling his eyes he elects to ignore it. _Just the same old Nokri_ he figured.
As they all settle down a bit he looks around, keeping watch till he hears an outburst he hadn't expected, Aldus's. A bit shocked at the Bow Brothers reaction, Eliran watches Aldus walk off, concerned but unsure of what to do.
---- 
After waiting for some time, Eliran has popped a squat by Nokri and Desii, and doing the only thing he really knew, he plucked quietly at his lute. There was a clear tension in the air, what with Nokri's outburst towards Desii, and then Aldus's to Nokri. Having left on bad terms with Nokri before the rescue, he wasn't really sure how to deal with her now they had rescued her, and so he sat with the intention of playing his quiet hymn till either Aldus returned or they were ready to go.

Desii says nothing as Nokri tends to herself, her brows raised in surprise. She unconsciously notes Nokri is using far more of the salve than necessary, but wisely keeps her mouth shut. Eventually the smaller girl finishes with her supplies and Desii returns them to her kit without a word.

The argument between Aldus and, well, mostly Aldus did no more for Desii's surprise. Clearly there's a lot going here, she idly thinks. The boys were so eager (*Well, Aldus again*) to rescue her, she acts like she didn't want to be rescued, and now the boys seems to regret it too. If all relationships are like this outside of Hylley, Desii's fine with a Hylley boy. Iono was nice...

As Aldus returns Desii stands up and dusts off her hip cape. "I, um, I'm glad we're all safe...! And it seems like we ditched the pursuers..." she says with a forced cheer voice. She trails off, seeing the others will have none of it. Still, her mother taught her to try her hardest to keep friends together in the event of a misunderstanding. "Shall we mosey on back? I could... could definitely go for some of Dain's carrot soup!" She says to no one in particular, heading for her horse again. She laughs awkwardly, trying to lighten the groups thoughts with idle chatter about Dain and Saila.

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Thankfully Desii assumed correctly when she said no pursuers seemed to be after you. Despite a slower pace you aren't harassed returning to town. Guards are initially wary on your approach, ones none of you recognize. It's the mayor, Frin who tells them to stand down. 

"You've..." she starts, eyes scanning your horses. When she sees Nokri she smiles. "You were successful! Wonderful!" she says genuinely. "Dain and Saila will be so pleased to see you all." One of the guards whispers something to Frin, and she pauses to listen. 

"Ah, the support from the kingdom has a request of you... Might you tell them what happened? It need not be all of you, but they want an idea of what they'll be facing in the coming days. The Captain here will take you to strategic command in town hall, and whoever isn't going feel free to head along to Dain and Saila's. I know they'll want to see you." Frin says. She gives a small bow in thanks.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

Aldus heads over to town hall to sum up the best he can what happened in the bandit hide out to the kingdom guard, after which he meets up with the rest back at Dain and Salias', hoping for a drink and a good nights rest to ease his troubled mind.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

Eliran joins Aldus at the town hall, and after he gives his report, takes his time to go around town and get things in order for departure the next day. Afterwards, he returns to Darn and Salias, telling the others that they should be set to cross into Eraia and head for Trisp the next day. And then after a meal downstairs, he decides to play a tune or two before heading to bed.

Aldus and Eliran's returning from debriefing the guard troop was a blessing for Desii. Saila had been singing Desii and her new friend's praises for what felt like hours, and Aldus's return gave the woman someone else to focus on. Desii quietly slipped aside, finding a corner of the bar to rest her head in. She takes a drink from the Eraian Cider she was offered, not usually a drinker but as the tale of their day was told she found herself more and more willing.

The concept of battle mages had always been lost on Desii; she staunchly believed magic has no place on a battlefield. Yet she was exactly that today, slinging spells to cause harm like any of the battle mages she's heard about before. She shakes her head a few times before her mind can recall if she actually killed anyone though. She doesn't want to know. Logic justifies the action, the men were trying to kill Nokri, who... doesn't deserve that. Not only that, they attacked Desii herself. Even if Nokri somehow deserved the violence she brought on herself, Desii knew she had don't nothing to slight them and self defense would hold up to any guardsman.

*But logic be damned*, she almost murmurs. This isn't what she set out to do, good intentions or not. Saila is lauding them has heroes, Dain as well in his quiet way, yet Desii can't picture her actions that way. She can only see the face of a bandit as he had his blade shocked from his hand by *her* spell. It's such a contrary to what she preaches magic is and isn't for, and it sends a shiver down her spine how quickly she embraced it.

The shivers double down as she remembers being in the 'embrace' of the bandit who had her pinned. Desii takes another swig of the cider, the sweet apple taste may not be the most appealing, but it's slight burn on her throat pulls her from her thoughts. She doesn't regret her actions there, and that's what's important. Self defense is defense for a reason; each spell she cast kept on more man from getting that close to harming her. Desii continues to run through her thoughts as she sits, until someone else comes to thank her for her actions and pull her from her swirling thoughts.

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

The celebration of your effort by the town's folk goes late into the night. You are thanked, praised, and promised a warm welcome anytime you pass through. You've done a lot of good for these people, who've had all the own damaged by the men you challenged. The town's guard thank you especially, for being able when they were not. Frin offers to resupply you as best the town can when you set out, though she cannot give you the horses you rode today. 

The guard troop from the kingdom returns early in the morning. They suffered minimal losses, thanks to the knowledge of the side entrance. The bandits were completely routed from the area, another cause for celebration by the town's folk. As festival plans are being made some of your friends in town see you off as you head for the border. Desii reassures Dain and Saila she'll look for Enera where ever she heads, and bring her home if she's been found. 

Trisp is a small town, beautiful in it's simplicity. You approach over a hill and look down on the town, windmills dotting the surrounding farmland adding the peaceful feeling. Most of the buildings in town have reddish roofs, assumably tile. There is much less black stone in Trisp than Lyall, a welcome change of pace from the rest of Eraia. The stone buildings are of a white tan stonework, giving the town a warm feeling. 

Most buildings are single story, except for a large building in an "L" shape on the western side of town. It's two or three stories and almost a fourth of the size of the town. If you squint you can see men in clergy purple walking on the balconies of the building. Between them and the tapestries you can deduce the building is in fact the monastery Trisp is famous for.

The town is both bustling and peaceful at the same time as you enter it's streets. Vendors don't shout across the streets hawking their wares, yet passersby make a point to stop. Wagons of vegetables and fruit roll through town but at a pace that doesn't imped foot traffic or kick up dust. People wave hello to you as you walk into town, and the directions to the bathhouse are easily spotted. The people are a rustic sort, either farmers or scholars. There seems to be no caste between them, farmers and scholars chatting amiably in the streets.

Desii gets a skip to her step as you crest the hill. "A whole town dedicated to the study of magic. They tell me Theanovene has sages in abundance, but you can hardly call the city dedicated to it. This is so exciting!" Desii says cheerily. "Perhaps I can find an Eraian willing to teach me light magic. Perhaps if I don't mention my home town..." she continues, musing further in her thoughts.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

Nokri pouted to herself, wanting to apologize but not knowing what she did wrong. Was it a crime to make sure her wounds healed properly? 

She stayed silent for the majority of their trip, focusing on "recovering" since no one else needed nor wanted her aid. Occasionally, short, envious looks were directed at Desii. What happened while she was gone? How had this girl gotten to be such close friends in such a short amount of time? *It must be her looks,* Nokri decided. *Pretty, and a strong fighter. Of course they'd like her. How expected.* 

Nokri was glad at least *someone* smiled at her presence, even if she had no clue who this person was. *Have we met before?* She decided to keep about her silent ways so as not to get in any more trouble, and just followed along. She was like a shadow, staying low and out of sight while the others were commended and praised. In an ideal world she would have liked to stock up on some ingredients, but with no possessions or money resorted to scouring the outskirts of town for common weeds and wildflowers. The whole time, watching her own back in case another whacked out stranger decided she looked like a great sacrifice.

Nothing she gathered was extraordinarily valuable or handy, but they'd be better in a pinch and it gave Nokri something to experiment with once the sun went down. Fiddling around with her old hobby put her slightly at ease, and from the open window she could pick up on gossip being spread on the streets below.

--

Upon hearing their next destination was known for magic studies, Nokri's interest was piqued. Perhaps she could pick up a thing or two for her studies. That idea dispelled after rolling into town and seeing all the clergy. With how uptight and strict churches can get, there'd be no way any black magic study was going on in this town, and they probably wouldn't take kindly to a foreign girl digging up their cemeteries in the name of research. *Prudes.*

Nokri continued to keep her head down, unsure of what kind of welcome she would receive. Before she hadn't cared much, but those were bigger cities with bigger populations. Her hair had remained down since losing her hairband and though signs pointing for the bathhouse were appealing, she wanted to test the waters of this neighborhood and perhaps pick up a replacement hairband before diving in to a nice bath. Perhaps one of the vendors would be open to trading for some potions instead of cash. *Or maybe they'd like to stick my head on a pike.*

As their party passed by the lined up market stalls, Nokri's pace slowed behind the others. Her eyes swept over the merchandise in the stalls, and several nice options stood out among the wares. Their current owners, however, looked at her inquisitively. It was best to carry on before that inquisitiveness turned to suspicion. *Maybe later I can ask someone else to buy me a headband,* she decided. The thought was ridiculous though. Was she a child? Nokri seethed in the fact that she'd have to keep being reliant on others. Her movements and actions were of no concern to others, so why did she need their help and permission to do something as simple as buy a headband? At times she considered just heading back to Dreca, maybe with some juicy information that would prevent them for executing her as a deserter for a little while. But there she'd be just as trapped. *There's no freedom anywhere, is there?*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-31*

Upon arriving at Trisp, Eliran promptly gave the crew a warning, "Guys we need to hit the bath house immediately. Common Eraian Courtesy" He explained. He had been bucketed one to many times in the past, and it ruined his clothes for the next two days, forcing him to buy a whole new set. If it weren't for what he knew about Eraians, he would have sworn the bucketing was a way to get travelers to buy their clothes. 

After the showers, Eliran gathered with the group, "So I have some business to take care of at the abbey." He looked to Desii, "If you want to come with me you should, the members of the Abbey here in Trisp are experts in light magic." he offered. Turning to Aldus and Nokri, who seemed to be  uncomfortable, Eliran paused, "If you guys could get an inn room or something that'd be great. I haven't been here in a while so I don't know anybody who could get us free room and board, and Eraians don't usually have musicians in taverns either." _plus you both stick out like a sore thumb and a wandering drecan is not a good idea._ he thought to himself.

--- 
After splitting up from the group, Eliran heads straight for the Abbey, which is luckily the easiest place to find in Trisp. As he walks he looks at the town, _there really isn't a place like it_ He thinks to himself, appreciating the Eraian set up, although he much preferred the hustle and bustle that cities like Theanovene offered, as well as their music. 
As he approached the Abbeys Entrance, he decided it might be best to knock and wait for a member of the clergy to help him out, after all the mail was for a Bishop, and he intended to hand it to the man directly if possible. He used the knocker, hitting it a courteous three times, and waited.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-31*

Nokri had no objection towards hygiene, and she was long overdue for a bath anyway. Even if it was brief, and she attracted stares from some of the other patrons, it was still nice to wash away the dirt and grime. Post-wash, the bard boy left her to watch over the laguz boy before parading off to do his own thing. "What kind of business do you think he has?" she piqued as he and Desii disappeared. If there wasn't anyone to give them free room and board, it probably wasn't an old lover.

Gazing around, Nokri picked a direction and just began walking. It took them back towards the main street with vendors they had passed when first arriving in town. *It would be nice to pick up some fresh clothes, too.* Despite giving her current clothes a decent scrub, they were permanently stained and torn in various places. They weren't the fanciest of clothes to begin with, just a simple long sleeved top and modest skirt. That top was now short sleeved, and the bottom of the skirt appeared to have been caught in a wood chipper.

A thought occurred to her. *If I don't even have money for clothes, how are we gonna get a room?*
"Hey, uh..." Despite speaking familiarly, Nokri kept her Drecan accent in check and used the common accent. "Do you have money with you?" After a moment's hesitation she added, "if you have any left over after the inn could I perhaps... borrow, or maybe trade you for some spare coins...? Name your price. Within reason."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-31*

He has no problem at all accepting Eliran’s suggestion for a bath. In fact he’s almost giddy at the thought. It’s been weeks since he’s has a proper soak, only being able to take quick baths and washing up in streams. He sinks slowly into the bath letting the hot water easy and relax his tight muscles from weeks of walking and fighting, not to mention, running. He takes his time washing up, and cleans his hair thoroughly before emerging lagudly from the bath, not wanting to leave. Water droplets trail down his toned body as he wraps a clean towel around his hips and makes his way over to the mirror. A burst of water falls to the ground as Aluds rings out his mane of alabaster hair. He brushes it out meticulously, ensuring every leaf and speck of dirt is undoubtedly gone, then redresses in fresh cloths he had in his pack. 

Upon exiting the bathhouse, hair still dripping slowly with excess moisture he sees the other three talking amongst themselves. Joining them he finds out the Desii and Eliran will be seeking out the monastery. They depart, leaving Aldus and Nokri on their own. *lovely!* he thinks to himself rolling his eyes when Nokri turns her back to him, heading towards the market stalls. *ah well, can't be helped i suppose* The bath having lifted his spirits he decides not to let it bother him.  

She begins browsing stalls almost immediately. Realising it will be easier to get a room without her tagging along Aldus takes a moment while she is distracted by something shiny to reserve rooms in a nearby Inn.

Aldus surveys the market, noting there aren’t a lot of people that look like him around, not a lot of laguz that is, and there seems to be less, if not, any people who looking like Nokri. *hmm… strange* He thinks before meeting back up with her. 

She turns to him, hesitantly. *that's new* he thinks.  "Hey, uh… Do you have money with you?" After a moment's hesitation she added, "if you have any left over after the inn could I perhaps... borrow, or maybe trade you for some spare coins...? Name your price. Within reason." She asks

He balks at her, raising an eyebrow in question before laughing. He just can't help it, is there no limit to this woman's gall? The pure ridiculousness. He composes himself fairly quickly, and refocuses before sighing. “I suppose you *do* stick out in those clothes, but what would you even have to offer me as repayment?”

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-02*

After going out, Afina and Elfriede had spent some time in the market buying odds and ends for Afina’s stay. Elfriede spent time taking in all the aromas of a town in autumn with his ancestrally enhanced smelling, even stopping to buy some baked goods to take back with them.

Suddenly, the princess stopped in her tracks, handed Elfriede her stuff haphazardly, spilling contents everywhere including some books and bolted off. Had someone stolen from her? Maybe she forgot to tell the bishop something important? He went to chase after her having picked up her pack, but was quickly cut of by the market crowd, losing sight of the wayward princess. Elfriede sighed and organized the books and other miscellaneous objects that fell out and eyed some of the book titles curiously. Odd topics for a light magic practicing princess..
---
Faun spent the next few minutes walking in the direction she ran, navigating the crowded streets. What could she have bolted off so suddenly for? His eye was caught by a small craft stand where a young woman was selling different colored ribbons and headbands. He briefly stopped and saw the different shades of blue she had. He thought about the conversation with Afina later that night and decided to buy her two different shades of blue as a gift. Elfriede had never seen her wear hair bands before but perhaps she’d like it? He was never a gift buyer and always felt like any gifts would be inadequate to loyalty.
---

Continuing and nearing the edge of the market Elfriede grew a bit more concerned having not seen her. He stopped to ask a stand owner if they had seen someone matching her description, which they shook their head at. Elfriede turned around when long blonde hair caught his eye. His view snapped to a young woman with long blonde hair at the edge of the market standing with a tall Laguz women with White Hair?! Atalantia?! Had they met up?!
He called out to them are he neared, pushing through the crowd, but they didn't turn to acknowledge him. As he approached them he realized something was off.. She was too short to be Afina.. And the Laguz… way too skinny. 
“What kind of… coincidence..?” He said in frustration as the two turned to look at him.

Faun clicked his tongue and his hand went to the hilt of his rapier upon seeing the girls face. Dark skin.. those eyes…, she was clearly Drecan. He noticed her and the Laguz male flinch visibly as he grasped the hilt, the sharp laguz eyes of the man narrowing a bit at him. It was then he noticed her condition. His heart sank a bit. Scrapes and bruises on her arms, obvious rope burns on her neck, rather raw in some spots, hair down and wild, and her clothes were torn and tattered. Her origins seemed to suddenly matter less as his grip loosened on his blade.
---

Elfriede slightly frowned and bowed. He then crouches a bit and stares at Nokri for a brief moment. “My apologies, but you do not look so well..” He said to the girl in a lighter tone then his initial approach. He took in the odd pair. A laguz tribal with a larger stature than himself, but around the same build to him and a small drecan girl who looks like she had been put through Lyarlel’s fury. She didn’t look like she was being held by this man, nor would a tribal have a reason to hold a small drecan girl. And she was standing too comfortably close to him to warrant concern. Hired bodyguard? From her condition she sure looked like she could use one. 

“I’m… Lieutenant Elfriede Faun… I’m sorry for my initial.. Approach.” He eyes the small girl. “I insist on bringing you back with me to the temple. I will secure of the initiate priests in training to take a look at those wounds. Plus you can tell me a bit more about yourself, are you locals?” He asked politely already know that answer. 

Elfriede paused a moment and smiled, “I offer you this, I do hope you take me up on it… I just would like to know… have you seen a rather regally dressed blonde woman about my height sprint through here?”

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

```Splitting from Head-table```

A letter is slid under Afina's door in the monastery, earlier than she would have expected yet not so early she wasn't awake to see it.

```
Milady Afina Tyndall,

I have set aside a training hall for the two of us this morning where you can show me your ability. I will build a lesson plan of sorts from our session in the afternoon, while you may attend any of the lectures occuring here at the monastery, or do self study in the library. In the pre supper hour I shall share my plan with you, and if you find it agreeable we may begin on it in the morn. I shall see you in 104 after you have dined for the morning. Feel no need to rush. 

Blessed are those words which carry my thoughts to you, may they express only the light and truth.
Head Bishop Torin Dean
```

- - - - -

"Welcome Princess." Torin says, not bowing despite use of the royal term. "The Cardinal tells me you are the eager type, and I'll admit that is the best kind of student in my opinion. My objective is simple, I'd like you to walk me through your spell craft, from simple to complex to unique. Show me what you understand enough to cast, what you have challenges with, and your favorites. Give me an insight into your connection with Lylalel's magic, so I may know who you are through your understanding." 

Torin gives you reign of the room, stepping aside with quill and ink.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-27*

Afina sat on the edge of her bed, head in her hands, as she mentally prepared to don her clothes and meet the bishop in the training hall. She sighed, rubbing her eyes as she thought about the events of the night before. _You can’t focus on that right now, your studies are at jeopardy here,_ Afina thought, standing from the bed. The princess held up her casual wear: a sleeveless dress that consisted of a gray bodice, embroidered with blue vines, and a light blue chiffon train. Leaning to peer closely, Afina found no stains or grime on the garment from their journey to Trisp. _It seems that this particular article of clothing survived_, Afina thought, lowering the dress to slip her legs into it. 

The princess paused as she noticed her reflection in the mirror, and straightened up. _Much has changed these past few weeks_, Afina noticed, analyzing herself in the reflection. Before departing from Theanovene, Afina’s slender frame had been much more accustomed to reading books. Now, she had garnered some bulk in her shoulders and thighs from her time spent walking and fighting. The Laeran frowned, adjusting the strap on her brassiere as she looked from her narrow hips to her petite chest to the angular features in her face. Afina’s eyes finally settled on the white scar that cut a jagged path across her right side. Starting beneath her bust, the mark ran down the princess’ otherwise unblemished skin, only to fade away right at the edge of her undergarments. Afina turned away from the mirror and quickly got dressed. _Another thing I should not be focusing on,_ she sighed. 

---

Afina nods in response to Torin’s instructions, chin held high as her muscles tense with anticipation. The princess spoke slowly and deliberately, partially for the bishop’s benefit, as well as her own. Her mind kept drifting; Afina forced herself to realign on light magic every time. “I feel that my style of magic has been heavily influenced from the environment I learned it in. While my master may have been Eraian, my techniques are wholly Laeran. You see, in Laera, there is a great emphasis placed on the pursuit of knowledge.” Afina opened her tomes to the beginning of her spells, her hand resting on the page. She adjusted the blue ribbon that held her hair away from her face, and tried to steady her breathing.  “But when everyone is pursuing the same knowledge, how does one establish dominance in the field? With speed.”

Much like the night before, Afina began with her entry-level spell, and small bits of light twinkled down from the ceiling. Drifting like snow through the air, they faded away as they came into contact with the floor. “I find even the most rudimentary of spells, furthermore, still prove to be effective at advanced levels when they are intermingled with complex castings,” Afina stated, looking up from her book to level her gaze with the bishop’s. His visage betrayed no emotion; the man simply observed with a blank expression. Chest tight, Afina turned back to her spells. “For example, the commonly known signaling spell, coupled by the projection of a shield.” The nonsensical language of light magic came forth from the young woman’s mouth soon after, and a bright white light shot upwards from her book. Flipping pages, Afina quickly forced the incandescent ball to break apart, and a bubble shield formed around the Laeran princess.

She glanced up quickly at the bishop through the yellow-white haze of the bubble shield. _Still no response,_ she noted, abrupting dismissing the light around her. She fired several other spells in rapid succession. A ball of light that crackling with a dazzling brilliance in the center of the room. A scatter shot of beams of light, giving the room the illusion that it was covered in holes. A projected shield on every side of the princess, forming a perfect cube around her. She flipped a page.

A white halo, like that so commonly used in her battles against the laguz, appeared on the floor around the princess, promptly enveloping her in a cascade of light. Another beam appeared on the adjacent wall, cutting through the original emission to form a cross inside the room. Afina quickly projected a third spell, truly stretching her mental fortitude as she projected a calibrated disk of light above her own head, nestled neatly into her hairline like a halo. Instantaneously, the beams were snuffed out, such a feat forcing the bishop’s eyes to adjust to sudden change in lumosity. The resulting effect made it seem like the princess herself glowed from the light of the halo. It, too, was extinguished in time.

“I find that a coupling of spells, in rapid succession, has proven to be the most adept form of practicing light magic. I also--” the princess hesitated. _It’s likely not worth noting that I practice fire magic. I’m not strong enough for it to be note-worthy_, she thought. “I know you are not here for me to also waste your time with theatrics,” Afina nodded, flipping pages. “There are other spells, that require a significant degree of mental fortitude, that I have mastered.” 

Suddenly, a wind whipped through the room as a vortex of light conjured itself along the walls, enveloping Afina and the bishop. A small ball of light formed in its center, rising from the floor to be eye-level with the princess. Afina scarcely breathed. _Just this, Afina. Accomplish this and you’ve proven that you’re a force to be reckoned with._ The princess felt the magic flowing through her body, a conduit by which to channel the arcane art. Something felt empty, though, like the princess was falling short. The vortex itself began to slow, and the ball of light that hung in the air before her flickered. _No! No, not after all this time, I can’t let this chance go,_ Afina thought quickly, holding her tomes tighter. _Focus, focus on the light, you can accomplish this feat, you cannot fail here,_ Afina thought, her voice raising in volume as she spoke.

A memory flickered through the back of her mind. Her time the night before, spent with Elfriede. Afina tried to force the image out of her head. _Now isn’t the time, you must succeed in casting, or all else will have been a waste_ she reprimanded herself, but the light around her only grew brighter. Afina vividly recalled how the knight had looked, hair tousled, as he sat on the edge of her bed, his powerful build making the time that he had spent training for the military very obvious. She remembered how scars covered his toned body. _Especially the one from the pirates_, she thought. Another image popped into her mind; A battered Elfriede, collapsed on the deck, the words “I’m sorry” piercing her heart like knives. 

In an instant, the light in front of Afina detonated, flowing out like a shockwave across the room. The sudden burst whipped around the light mage, the blue ribbon that held her hair back beginning to unravel.  Light cascaded across the room, with Afina at its epicenter, voice loud and eyes burning with tears as she conjured such pure amounts of light. Coming back to her senses, Afina realized that she was still only showcasing her skill, and promptly extinguished the light. Hoping to hide the tears that had come to her eyes, Afina bowed, her blonde locks spilling from her ribbon and hiding her face. 

“Thank you for this opportunity, bishop. I look forward to your continued correspondence,” she said quickly, before turning to walk from the room. 
---
The door closed with a loud slam, relief washing over Afina as the tears escaped her eyes. The princess looked up to the ceiling as she wiped her eyes. _Perhaps I may find some company now that such business have been taken care of_.

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Torin watches the Laeran Princess set her feet and cast the first spell. Then another, and another merged with that one. The ingenuity she shows is excellent, though a tad out of the ordinary for Eraia's mentality. It's not... an unpleasant thing to see for the Bishop. Eraia was rout, routine, and knew it's skill set well. What this girl was doing before his eyes is the kind of magecraft that would shake the core of Eraia's magic community. Breaking from the mold, using magic creatively and not as written... It set Torin's eyes alight.

Still, she was only a temporary visitor. Nor is she anyone of power in the church. It wouldn't be long before she left Trisp, heading back with her unique outlook to Callora. Or Theanovene, as the Cardinal informed Torin yesterday. Torin's train of thought is lost as Afina crafts columns of light in ways he never even thought were viable. His eyes sparkle in the light, watching as if Lylalel herself had landed before him. His eyes drift to Afina herself, her lithe form tense with concentration and yet flowing into the magic. Torin was momentarily mesmerized by the way her hair fluttered in the spell's effect and her eyes reflected the spell's epicenter.

The moment was longer than he thought, only snapping out of his daze as the young mage turns to leave. He nearly stumbles with how quickly he moves to follow her, catching her just as she reaches the door. He places a hand on her shoulder, motioning for her to stop. He's somehow out of breath, taking a deep breath before speaking.

"That was... astounding Princess. You have such a fundamentally different understanding of light magic than we here at the monastery. I can easily say we will have plenty to learn from each other, a much more agreeable relationship than that of mentor and student." he says. His voice slows as he gets control of his breath. "That was an excellent showing. I have my work cut out for me to plan for the coming days, I shall need all of the afternoon to process I fear. As planned before supper we can reunite and discuss this arrangement." He pauses.

"I hope to learn your mindset, and who you are fully in these next few days. I feel you could be the key to... something more, personally, and for all of Eraia." he says, a glazed look in his eyes. He blinks and it's gone. "And we'll have plenty to teach you as well. Our mindset may just spark more of your creativity and give you new heights to reach." he adds before giving motion for you to continue out the door. The door closes behind you as he watches you leave the training room.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

[afina jump to table 3]

[afina back to table 1?]

Afina walked briskly down the hallway towards the Cardinal’s office._This could be a momentous mistake,_ she thought, hands clenched at her sides. _If Enera really was kidnapped, then that’s the first shot fired between Eraia and Callora in years. And puts me, not only on enemy lines, but directly involved in the situation._ Afina bit her lip nervously as the door to the Cardinal’s office approached. _But if a Calloran citizen was, in fact, kidnapped… then it’s also my duty to return her safely to her family_, Afina thought, shaking her head as she tucked her hair behind her ear. Even if Enera wasn’t a citizen of Laera, she was a citizen of the Calloran alliance as a whole, meaning Afina still had a duty to protect her. The kingdom of Callora only worked because individual nations looked out for each other. 

“Not to mention, this is for one of Eliran’s friends,” Afina mumbled, hesitating in front of the Cardinal’s door. _Honestly, after all this time, one would think I’ve given up on impressing Eliran,_ she thought with a small smile. Afina straightened her back, lifting her chin up, and knocked on the door to the Cardinal’s office. A reply from inside let Afina know that she may enter, and she pushed the door open.

“Hello Cardinal Raive, I hope I am not intruding,” the Laeran said, stepping into his study. “You have offered nothing but your utmost hospitality to me, yesterday, and for that I would like to thank you. But I also was wondering if you might be able to assist me with something. You see, Bishop Dean indicated that there was another Calloran light mage practicing here. I was curious as to whether or not I might be able to meet him or her. Callorans seem to practice a different orientation of light magic than Eraians or Theanovians do. I was hoping to compare strategies.” The princess spoke formally, curtly, with her hands clasped behind her back. She had set the wheels in motion for a potentially risky move, without much promise of a reward. But it felt like the proper thing to do, for her kingdom, and for Eliran.

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Raive's head turns around, hand still outstretched for a tome on the top of his shelf. Despite half way through removing the book from it's resting place, he leaves it on the shelf as his body follows his head to face Afina. His eyes don't leave Afina's face as he picks up his cane from the spot it rested against his desk, nor while he walks back to his chair. Just as you begin to question the questioning look on his own face, he speaks. 

"My... apologies Princess. You must be mistaken, or Bishop Dean provided you false information. No other Callorian studies here." he says finally, slowly. His face then warms, giving you a comforting smile. "I wish it were the case, but you are assuredly our first Callorian student."

"Now, if it comes to those studying here you should meet, I can give you a run down of some of our most skilled practitioners. Fyil dabbles in the interaction between Light magic and natural forces, while Drinnral is our battle application expert. Of course there's Bishop Torin himself, who is a master of the written spell and researches spell runes in his spare time... Ah yes, and I suppose I could make this list as well, if you'd so choose. I regrettably spend less time on research than in my younger days, but I may have had a hand in the creation of pillar basis for spellcraft." He says, pretending to be arrogant with a smile on his face as he talks about himself. 

"I don't quite have the time now, but if you tell Bishop Torin your personal interests I'll be happy to introduce you to the proper people tomorrow." he suggests.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

The Tyndalls were tacticians; Afina was quick to watch the body language of the Cardinal as he spoke, turning to face her. His shocked body language meant he wasn't anticipating such a question, and clearly he was analyzing the princess right back. The princess tried to keep her posture formal and unwavering. The Cardinal maintained eye contact as he moved to grab his cane. Afina would have tensed to grab her tomes if she had them on her (as weeks in combat had trained her to do), but the princess was assured that the Cardinal would be unjustified attacking her here and now. _Not to mention the political backlash_, she thought. _I must tread lightly myself, for the good for Callora_. 

The Cardinal spoke slowly, thoughtfully, offering her a friendly smile with the concession that no other Callorian studied at the monastery. _Impossible... it's highly unlikely that a teenaged Enera gifted in light magic exists within herself. The connection must be there_. Morras Raive continued, his friendly smile and posture largely evident. Afina wanted to believe him; She had known how skilled and proficient Raive was since her tutor had taught her of who he was. She wanted to trust this man. But a nagging doubt settled like a weight in her stomach.

_"... but I may have had a hand in the creation of pillar basis for spellcraft"._ Afina couldn't help but react to such a statement; her coalescing pillars were the backbone for so many of her spells! There was no hiding the surprise on her face, she had to admit her admiration. "Thank you, Cardinal Raive, you must be assured that the pillar spells are the foundation to many of my spell forms. I would be most delighted to hear about the conjuring of such a situation! But... you make a fair statement; Perhaps I should be voicing such an interest in diverse light magic orientation to Bishop Dean. We are still in the early stages of training-- successful, I would think, but early-- so perhaps there still stands much to be learned from other conjuring strategies. My apologizes, Cardinal, with the progression of my light magic I should have been more patient." She bows thoughtfully, cracking a smile ever so slightly. "A Laeran fault, I would concede." 

The princess turned to leave. "Thank you for your time, I hope to train with you yourself in this coming week, as well." Thus, with a thunk, another door swung shut behind Afina. _What do I even begin to make of this?_

---

Afina walked into the park, fatigued from her fast walk from the monastery to the meeting location. Nokri followed close behind her heels. "Well," she began, exhaling to prepare herself, as well as catch her breath. "The prospects for meeting with Enera look unlikely. But. I believe with proper synthesis there is much to be garner from how the Cardinal behaved. I shall offer any information that might assist us in the search for Enera, so that we might be able to plan our successive strategy from here."

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

"It is no fault Princess, Laeran curiosity has revealed many secrets in the past. Without that trait, there are tomes worth of spells we'd never have seen. Be proud, Princess Afina." the Cardinal says from his desk as Afina leaves. He looks down at his papers, seemingly returning to work despite not reaching for a quill.

(OOC: returning to <#453376851834961920>)

The appointed time had come, yet Torin insisted on keeping Afina in the training room. Shortly after dinner, over an hour before sunset and her meeting with everyone, he had approached the princess. 

`"I'd like see more of your magical talents in regards to the curriculum I've built. It will be a series of testing to decide at which level we should begin. Come come."`

Test he did indeed. Torin started from the simple and went to a variety of extremes, taking notes feverishly the entire time. Each time Afina completed a spell, Torin had the next challenge ready for her. While grueling, each task was unique, requiring Afina to try and do things just a little bit differently. 

Thankfully, the spellbook he provided was worn thin, down to the spine and cover. The lost of the Tome gave Afina a short reprieve from the exercises while Torin headed for the shelf by the door to provide a new one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-22*

Afina was growing restless. _I have to make my way to the door,_ she thought, glancing between the clock and Bishop Torin, who had turned his back on her to grab another book from the shelf. Afina looked down at the cover of the tomes she had already worn through, which now was nothing more than a piece of leather, sewn together with remnants of paper. She set the discarded cover on top of a nearby desk, before wiping away the sweat that had begun to form at her brow. Torin’s teachings had stretched her stamina to its limits; Perhaps her display of skill beforehand had set his expectations high. 

He was enthusiastic, if nothing else. The bishop was keen to see her skills, as well as test him. _Though he didn’t necessarily approach at a convenient time,_ she thought, frowning at the bishop’s back as he rummaged through his library. Even still, Afina appreciated having a motivated teacher, she had to admit. 

“Ah… Bishop Torin. If you would actually be so kind-- I have very much appreciated the added challenges you’ve poised for me, but I’m afraid that I told my escort that we would discuss return trip plas tonight.” Afina glanced toward the door, torn between asserting her position and meekly bowing out of the room. _You have friends to assist, and prestige as a princess,_ she thought, turning away to walk towards the door. The bishop began to protest and Afina mumbled a string of apologies, promising that they would continue training after a full night’s rest. “I’m awfully sorry, I am, but I would like to hold good on the promise I made to my traveling escort--.”

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Torin grabs at Afina's arm, twisting it behind her and pulling her away from the door. He pulls her arm above her head and slams it against the wall next to the door, using his larger mass to pin the Princess against the wall. 

"Princess!" he shouts, a little louder than even he thought. His eyes are wide, yet his brows are narrowed and calculating. He stares harshly into Afina's eyes, emanating a cold aura that sends a shiver down her spine. 

"You're... you're being foolish." he says, a wry yet slightly *off* smile crossing his lips. He looks over her shoulders at the wall, for reasons only know to him, giving her that cold glance from aside every few seconds. Torin rolls his shoulders, tightening his grip on Afina's wrist. He looks back at her eyes, the piercing gaze hiding an underlying gleam of pure, unadulterated interest and passion that is outright unnerving. 

"You have the opportunity to be my apprentice! Yes, I should make that clear, that's clearly the problem. Morras has his Progidy from the border Enera, but you! You are the true diamond in the rough, the avatar of Lylalel herself! You can't see it for yourself, obviously, but with an experienced mentor you can truly be Her light on this world! You're magic, you're magic is..." Torin shivers, shaking his head with a nervous energy before once again locking eyes with Afina, nose mere inches from her own. "You're magic is less a science and more an art! You dance and sing light like it is the language you are meant to speak and *it may well be!* Morras doesn't have this in Enera, not in the slightest. Afina, you are... many times the sage Enera will ever be and far more..." the corner of his lip curls, "beautiful, than she."

"Fitting, of Lylalel's Avatar!" He says with a crazed fervor. He yanks her arm off the wall, forcing Afina to stumble forward behind him. "You'll see soon enough, Callora and it's ways, the Knight Lieutenant, all things you just need time to acclimate away from. Much as Enera did, though as you may need persuation and I came prepared for that because I could never let you slip away after seeing such talent, such *Beauty!*" he says. 

With a powerful throw he launches Afina tumbling to the ground. Her head hits the back wall of the room, and before she knows what's up Torin is straddling her on the ground with a cloth in his hands. He slams his large hand into her face, covering her mouth and face with the cloth. He continues to talk as Afina starts to feel strange, a hazy feeling overtaking her senses. All she can see is his face, pressed close to her own as he earnestly explains his thoughts, and the bare corner of the door far behind him. "I'll have a room made up for you, just like Enera has. You'll study, harder than ever, just study all day and night. We'll practice, we'll bond, and soon you'll understand. We simply can't waste your talents on the world as whole as all. You must take responsibility for that, after all."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

Afina’s mind was reeling as the sickeningly sour smell from the cloth filled her lungs. She coughed as the foul odor seemed to permeate her very being, and the princess’ head started spinning. _The avatar of Lylalel… acclimate away from… Callora… Knight..._ Fragments of thoughts drifted through the Callorian’s mind. She was only acutely aware of her legs kicking, her body struggling in protest. The bishop leaned in close, his dull gray eyes wide and feverish. Afina glared at him, focusing on every detail of his putrid face to stay conscious, her eyelids feeling heavy.

_Think hard. Master Witella trained you in self defense, to forget it now would be doing him a diservice_, Afina thought. Her mind flashed back to her youth.

```
Afina was ten. The cold of the stone floor seemed through her dress as she lay on her back in the study. Above her, a mural of the sky was painted in vivid blues and yellows on the ceiling, and the distant chirp of birds outside distracted her. “Afina, please,” her tutor said, though his tone was more coaxing than commanding, yet still firm. “This is important.” The young face of her tutor came into view, dark hair falling across his forehead, and gray eyes serious. “If you don’t know how to defend yourself, you’re shaping up to be a rather ineffective queen. "

Afina’s gaze shifted towards her tutor, who sat with legs crossed next to her. She sighed. “I know what to do. I have to fight back, right?”

“Precisely,” Witella nodded, sitting forward to place his hands on her neck. His touch was light and gentle. “And thus from here?”

The young princess pondered thoughtfully. “I should attack your eyes or neck or fingers,” she said with a sense of confident finality. 

“And?

“And make the attack as hard to do as possible!”

“Correct.”
```

Afina’s eyes watered as the stench of the chemical-coated fabric drifted off the cloth. Gritting her teeth, she gripped one of the bishop’s fingers in her fist and sharply tugged backwards. Her other hand moved to his face, her hand trembling with exertion as she tried to jam her thumb into a pressure point. His eyes, his nose, his skin. Afina growled as her body strained against the poison, as her legs already began to feel limp and useless beneath her. Even her efforts to break Bishop Dean’s finger failed; If anything, the bishop seemed more entertained by her resistance. 

Afina closed her eyes as the last of her strength left her. Her legs went limp. Her hands fell to her sides. A tear streamed down her face as she closed her eyes. _I can’t let him win… but I have no choice..._

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-26*

As Faun walked down the hallway his heart raced again. *Maybe they took her out for food? It's oddly silent now..* He couldn't help but feel like something was amiss. He picked up the pace. As he neared the classrooms Faun heard a deep **thud** from inside one of the rooms. His heart skipped a beat and he sprinted up to it shouting through it. 

“Hello?! What's happening in there?!” He went to open the door. **Locked**.

The light shuffling on the other side of the door and the silence concerned him deeply. 

“Please open the door, somebody!” he knocked heavily on the door.

His response being his voice echoing throughout the halls. Faun gritted his teeth. **I can't believe this!** Who is so damn foolish as to ignore me?! No priest of of the Good Lady...

He planted his feet firmly on the ground and pressed all his minor weight into the door hearing a very slight buckle. His weight wasn't going to do much, but.. He pressed upward leveraging his anchored feet with the floorboards trying to force the handle upward. The door cracked loudly but alas.. did not budge. 

“LET ME IN DAMN YOU.” Elfriede placed his dagger firmly in the key hole and spun quickly kicking straight out, planting his boot firmly on the hilt slamming the dagger through the lock shattering the mechanism… and his dagger. The door loudly popped and swung open slamming hard into the wall.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-26*

A loud banging from the door jolted Afina's senses, dulled as they were. The bishop looked equally surprised as they heard a man's voice call through the door, and the cloth hovering away from Afina's mouth long enough for her to get a breath of fresh air. Invigorated with the new possibility of assistance, the princess pressed her advantage. _He's distracted by the door, I have a chance,_ she thought, glancing to the sides to see if she might be in range of a makeshift weapon. No such luck. 

_As difficult as possible..._ Afina thought, watching as the bishop, confident that the outsider posed no threat, turned back to her. He pressed the cloth firmly against her face, making it near impossible to breathe from anywhere but her mouth, but Afina held her breath. She balled her hand into a fight and punched upwards, connecting with the Eraian's throat. He wheezed, the air rushing from his lungs, but her attack did little to hinder him. The bishop smothered her face with the rag, forcing her to gasp and inhale the foul stench. She glared at him over the cloth, her arms and legs unresponsive, but mind fiercely fighting against the influence of the drug. 

The Callorian's eyelids fluttered as the weight of sleep pressed upon her. Truly, this time, it seemed that her fate was unavoidable. Not even outside intervention could save her from the bishop's plan; For once, Afina had been outsmarted by his hidden motives and preparations. 

Then, in an instance, the sound of shattering metal reverberated off the walls, and the bishop stood, still grasping his cloth in his hands. Afina coughed, rolling onto her side to try to get a straight sight of the door. Her arms trembled as she pushed herself onto her elbows, squinting in her attempt to see. Whoever had intruded upon the bishop had his full attention now.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-26*

The scene before him was one he could have never predicted. Faun's mouth dropped and hung open and his eyes widened. He felt like he couldn't breathe in that moment. Bishop crouching over an unconscious… 

Everything was silent. In his face he felt waves of intense heat. He finally caught his breathe. Shakily his hand arose and grasped around the hilt of his sword and drew it. The metal sound reverberated off the walls of the classroom. Faun's face did not change.

The Bishop eyed his sword with disbelief. “You dare?” he muttered self righteously.

Elfriede slowly leaned forwards and began walking towards the bishop swinging at him without remorse. Surprisingly swift for an older man he stumbled backwards causing Elfriede's wild swings to hit air. Fauns mind racing, he'll never be able to forget that scene… 

Torin scoffed and grabbed at his tomb that was always at his side, quickly firing off an easy spell fast as lightning.

Elfriede surprised at the disgusting mans dexterity, was forced back by small light bolts searing the ground.

As he reoriented himself he was bombarded with unbelievable burning in his right arm. A beam of light left Torins hand and landed squarely on his sword arm sending his rapier soaring and embedding itself in the wall behind him. Faun crying out in pain tore himself from the lights embrace making his way towards his sword. As he approached it he was met with a blinding flash as a wall of light was raised in front of it.


Elfriede already knew the pain such burning light would cause and turned back to the smirking Bishop. The knights gaze fell to the prone woman behind him and he winced in disbelief again. ***Was she even breathing?!***

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-26*

Afina's eyes looked from one component of the newcomer to another. _Purple clothes... caramel hair... a rapier... those familiar amber eyes! Elfriede!_ The Callorian watched as Elfriede charged at the bishop, gaze stern and focused. _Of course! I didn't show up to help the others inside, it's only natural that Elfriede would question my absence! I have to help him,_ she thought, looking out in front of her at the books that lay in piles on the ground. Most were too far out of reach, especially as her body refused to cooperate. 

She reached an arm out towards the nearest tomes, praying that it was one of light magic. Her fingers brushed the heavy leather binding as she reached out. Her face was pale and damp with sweat; She had breathed in too much of the drug, and it was working its way through her body with debilitating efficiency. She had to help Elfriede. The clatter of metal and a flash of light made Afina turn, looking through the cracks in the hair that hung in her eyes. Elfriede gripped his arm, disarmed and wincing with the pain. Afina turned back to the nearest tomes, sitting at the top of a small stack. If she could just reach it...

The tower of books toppled over as Afina grabbed the tomes, and the bishop's attention turned suddenly back towards the princess. She locked eyes with the deranged man, and a shiver ran up her spine. He was crazed and powerful, a dangerous combination. The princess glanced over at Elfriede. He was tense, agitated, and clearly fearful. Afina nodded her head slightly; Even when it was herself in peril, she felt the need to comfort him that everything would be alright.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-26*

Faun gasped when Afina budged slightly. *She’s at least alive.* The Bishop turned to her with a sneer. Elfriede spat on the ground in sheer disgust of the man. *This asshole calls himself Eraian... You’re barely human.* 

Faun began his approach again, still holding his stinging arm tightly. He dodged left as the bishop fired a barrage of bolts at him, all barely missing the mark. Faun planted his left foot on the wall and soared towards the bishop overtop of his searing projectiles. He kicked towards the bishop’s head swiping air again. The Bishop leaning back, blasted faun with a quick but forceful spell sending him hard into the wall. 

Elfriede recovered and began running at the man again. Suddenly he paused and couldn't find his breathe. Torin had aimed his glowing hand towards Afina.

“Halt you foolish lad! You clearly lack the discipline of Lady Lylalel!” he snarled at the knight lieutenant.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-26*

The bishop towered over Afina, his hand glowing with a dangerous brilliance. He spoke the nonsensical language of light magic, but nonetheless his speech was violent and ominous. Afina looked around the bishop at the far corner of the room; Elfriede had been knocked back against the back wall, and was catching his breath. Afina turned her stare back to the bishop. _This is pathetic_, she thought. _Reduced to the floor, cowered like a cornered animal._

With a grunt, Afina threw her upper body at the nearest tomes, her useless legs limp beneath her. Her fingers slipped over the leather surface, and she tried to yell in frustration. Her voice came out as a quiet, pained "no!" as the bishop strode to face her. He squatted down, using his hand to lift Afina's chin to face him. 

"Forgive me, I would never mean to taint such an image of Lylalel herself. But one must do what is for the good of her light," he said, standing straight. Afina's gaze followed him, brows furrowed in confusion and concentration. Suddenly, the bishop raised his shoe, and with a resounding finality, brought it down upon Afina's outstretched hand. The princess yelped in pain, whining softly as she cradled her hand back towards her body. She tried to move her fingers; To no avail, it was most definitely broken. Tears streamed down her cheeks as the religious man walked away from her, leaving the princess to succumb to the influence of the drugs. Her eyes followed him as the bishop turned his attention to Elfriede. _Don't you dare, you will most definitely pay..._ Afina thought, watching helplessly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-26*

**Crack**. 
The resounding sound that he was helpless to prevent stung him like an arrow through the heart. *Fina… I'm sorry..* He grimaced heavily fighting back tears to no avail. Her crying face..

He remembered the nights they shared in a flash, bonding and getting closer. Before he knew it his legs were pedalling forward again. Elfriede felt this man in that moment was below the worst demon. 

Flashes of light soared at him again which he ducked and weaved out of the way of until he finally go close to the man again. Elfriede saw an opening through his tears and threw a punch at Torin. The sly bishop blocked it with his tomb and promptly kneed Faun in the gut reeling him over. 

Time seemed to slow down as he eyed Afina, his friend… more than that… she clutched her hand close to her chest. 

She seemed so helpless, *Afina*. **helpless**. How dispicable of a man must he be to have tricked her into this position. Elfriede gritted his teeth in the purest rage he's ever felt. He raised his head up at the smirking Bishop, whose face suddenly twisted with disgust at Faun. 

The knight lieutenant jumped towards Torin who held a hand up to stop his approach. Terror seemed written on the man's face which was a welcome sight. Elfriede’s canine jaw and bulging wolf like muscle began to form. Hair came out of every surface of his body. His piercing amber eyes still locked with Torin, this earless chestnut furred wolf truly looked like a monster. The wolf's jaws clenched down with incredible force around Torins neck tearing into it. Blood ran thick staining the man's robes and the fur around Faun's mouth as he flailed to push the snarling beast off of him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-27*

Afina froze in horror, uninjured hand moving to cover her agape mouth. _No... there's no possible way... not Elfriede..._ she thought, tears brimming in her eyes once more. Her eyes were fixated on Elfriede, wide and glossy with terror. Her eyes trailed across him as the laguz straightened once more, satiated by the limp form of the bishop on the ground. _Scars... where ears should be_, she thought, remembering their encounter the night before. She had run her hands through his hair and never suspected a thing. 

Blood dripped down off his muzzle, staining the floor, the bishop's white robes, his chestnut colored fur. Afina's eyes widened at the growing pool of blood on the floor. _He killed him,_ she thought, gaze slowly raising back to Elfriede. He turned to look at her as well; She knew those amber eyes, there was no denying it. But this was not the same man that she thought she knew. Afina inhaled sharply as Elfriede stepped towards her.

```
Afina was eight. Last she knew, she was riding home in a carriage with her parents, returning from a celebration in another Callorian kingdom. Security was light, on account of much of the forces being dispatched to the festival to keep the peace. Her father was talking about the Canterets, and how their son Eliran was proving to be gifted in the arts. 

And then the carriage was in flames, and Afina had been knocked onto her back. Her dress was torn, and her knees were scraped, but she was alive. In the distance, the few guards they had were slashing at wolves and bandits alike, who leapt and snapped at the horses the men rode.

One man broke from the pack to approach the young princess. Afina tried to escape, to hide. But the laguz man closed in too quickly. He towered over her, flecks of blood in his fur, snarling. She only remembered what happened in fragments after the fact. Pain rocketing up her side. A dress covered in blood. Her father calling for her to stay with him. And the laguz who was to blame.
```
Afina blinked the tears from her eyes to see Elfriede, standing in his bloodied clothes, watching her with grave concern on his face. Blood was smeared across his skin and hair, and his clothes were unrecognizable through the red that stained them. "I..." she began, voice weak and hoarse, trying to form a respond as he walked closer. 

Fear made Afina's chest feel tight, and she tried to back away, but her legs refused to move, and her uninjured arm gave out from the exertion of propping her up. Her hands caught her fall, landing on an open tomes book beneath her, and Afina winced at the pressure it placed on her broken hand. The princess looked down between the open book and the laguz in front of her. "Don't..." she began, holding up one hand to stop Elfriede. He seemed like he wanted to explain himself, to tell her everything. But Afina did not want to hear anything.

"Stop!" she commanded, her voice weak but charged with emotion. The princess blinked more tears from her eyes, as her free hand gripped the tomes beneath her tightly. _Would I... really use this against Elfriede?_

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-27*

The taste of blood in his mouth. The iron tasting liquid felt almost natural running down his jaw. Faun was disgusted with himself. He stared down at what he had done, feeling no remorse for the dead bishop, but rather… feared the consequences. 

And.. He feared what was about to happen. He… was going to tell her... Elfriede turned around and looked at Afina, the princess wide eyes and shaking. He took a step forward and she gasped and winced with what little strengthen she had. He could see her hand already changing color from the crushing stomp. It hurt his heart to look at her. Again he took a step and she winced. *I'm a monster…*

In a moment he changed back, his clothes torn all over, and blood still dripping from all around his face and neck. 

"Stop!" Afina propped herself up, still clearly terrified. He wiped the blood from his mouth with his ragged sleeve. Tears still flowed freely without him even noticing. 

He swallowed hard as Afina collapsed again on her broken hand. His eyes narrowed filled with tears and he opened his arms out. “Fina, I’m sorry I.. let me at least…” he took a few more steps forward. “..take you to a bed..”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-27*

Afina feebly mustered her strength to show Elfriede how she felt, eyes narrowed and body language closed off. The aloof posture and edge in her voice was not as menacing with her trembling frame and heavy breaths, but she truly _was_ upset. _Elfriede had lied about being a laguz_, she thought, the notion angering her the more she ruminated on it. 

Exasperated, and fading quickly, Afina tried to be dismissive. "I don't... need help from the likes of you--," she began, before the world dipped and swayed in front of her. Afina tried to steady herself, but already on the floor, there was little she could do. The princess' eyelids fluttered for a moment, before the room, the blood, and Elfriede faded to black nothingness.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-07-27*

Elfriede frowned heavily at her prone form  and thought of thier life together shattering before his eyes. He looked back to the massive pool of blood behind him and himself covered in blood. Will the coucil or anyone even believe it was self defense...

He looked at the torn throat of the Bishop Torin and felt outright disgusted and turned away. 
Faun lifted Princess Afina up over one shoulder and retrieved his sword from the wall with the other with eyes now stinging from the extended crying. He wanted to cry more but his body wouldn't allow it it seemed.

Faun carried Afina back to her room and gently placed her on her bed. *I was just here last night.. She looked at me so differently just a day ago...*

Elfriede took his time tending to her hand, there wasn't much he could do at the moment other than simply splint it back in place and wrap it. He needed to find a healer.

He reasoned he had until morning to figure out the bishop mess. There most likely wouldn't be sleep for him tonight. 

He quickly washed up and threw out his clothes replacing them for his other set he had packed from Faun Manor. Looking at himself in the mirror, he frowned again. *Disgusting animal.*
