ZaRel clears his throat as he begins talking. "I have come to this continent in search of a person fit to rule with me. However, I have found that a worthy mate is rarer than I originally anticipated. Since finding that out I have been following rumors that may lead me to the proper person.

The latest rumor I have been following is one of a large, intimidating man that has travelled across all the lands and meet every kind of people. Does this sound like yourself? Are you a man that has travelled to many places and met many kinds of people?"

<@184440044822462464>

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-10*

Ienzo looks around at his surroundings be fore answering. "yes I do travel around and I do get to meet many people. More importantly to rule with you and a mate? What do you mean by that?" Ienzo finishes with a confused look on his face

**lapost48** - *2017-10-10*

I am in line to rule over a set of people who rely on my family for their survival. I need to find a mate, err, I suppose you would call that a wife. I need to find a wife that will accompany me back to the island my family protects

I have been having trouble finding a mate, err, *wife*, that fits my requirements and I was hoping that you have run into someone that would have fit

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-10*

This is so sudden, helping someone to find a wife is no easy task.  What kinda person are you looking for if you don't mind me asking?

**lapost48** - *2017-10-10*

Have you heard of Manakete?

ZaRel quickly tuns his head and brushes his hair up over his ear revealing the point. "They exist, they aren't myths, and I need to find another one."

He then quickly drops the hair back into place covering the only indication of his race.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-10*

A Manakete, you say that is a great surprise. If you didn't have those pointy ears like the legends say I would have thought you were making fun of me. In all my travels I can recall saving a young girls with pointy ears like that from some bandits quite some time ago. If what your telling me is correct your the second manakete I have meet in my life time.

**lapost48** - *2017-10-10*

Upon hearing this, ZaRel gets a noticable excitement across his face and a glint in his eyes. "You have? Truly!? Where? How long ago? Where?" As ZaRel begins bombarding Ienzo with questions he regains his composure.

"Where did you see this girl?" He asks, realizing the answer wouldn't help him as he is unfamiliar with the continent he immediately responds to himself, "That doesn't help me, would you be able to take me to the place you have saved this girl and help me find her? I can not pay you, but if I achieve my goal in these lands then I can reward you with a journey than no other has ever made. A trip to my island, an island that has no legend as there has never been a person that has made it there and returned alive. That must be enticing for such a well travelled adventurer as yourself."

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-10*

seeing how this person reacted made him wonder if the journey would be fun.  Ienzo thinks a adventure like this would be the perfect thing to help him forget about all the things on his mind. " You know what I will show you where I encountered her, but I will let you know it was about a year ago so who knows where she ended up at now. Otherwise I am Ienzo, you may of heard of me with the title the champion of children i will be glad to help tou on your search for a bride, may i ask your name good sir?"

**lapost48** - *2017-11-16*

My name is ZaRel. The man from the rumor was also referred to as a champion to children across the land. I am glad I have found the right man.

[Uhh, end aside I guess. Do we have to say that?]

Characters: ZaRel and circus people
Asided from: Tent
Location: Tent
```

"Did you see that dragon in that cage!? I've never seen a dragon before! It was terrifying, I was looking at it from behind this tent and then it escaped so I ran away and tripped over that log." ZaRel points at the log that is still half sticking out of the tent, seemingly unmoved by his full forced trip over it.

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

The man blinks once and chuckles slightly. "Well then. I suppose I owe you an apology for tripping you!" The laguz woman frowned at the mention of the dragon. 

The man looks right at ZaRel. "But boy, this isn't a safe place to just be roaming about. Be it because of logs or dragons! What are you doing here?"

**lapost48** - *2017-11-16*

"I'm looking for a friend. I don't know much about her, it's been so long, but I'm looking for a girl that isn't from around here and I know she is fond of dragons so i have been searching out stories of dragons to look for her.

Perhaps joining a circus that travels a lot I could pick up on more stories and search more places?"

"I'm quite nimble, at least when not running from dragons..."

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

The man crosses his arms over his chest. "I know the novels love to embelish the idea of running away to the circus boy, but" he starts before he's cut off by one of the laguz woman touching his shoulder as she walks past him. 

"Oh pish posh. If he thinks he's cut for the circus, lets see it." She looks the man in the eye for a moment before nodding to her partner. Her partner smiles and nods as well.

"Sure, every kid dreams of being in the circus. You think you've got what it takes little one?" the other laguz says to ZaRel.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-17*

"I believe that I do. Give me the chance to prove myself and I'll show you!"

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

"Alright then. Think you can do a trapzee swing?" she asks.

**lapost48** - *2017-11-17*

"I'm sure I could!" (Ooc: so will this lead to something with a threat level in the table or do I just do it?)

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

She motions upward. The laguz's outfits are explained by the trapzee setup above you, two poles on opposites side of the tent leading to platforms. The women split off, one to the far platform and one walking you to the close one. The man sighs, but says nothing.

As you stand atop the platform the laguz woman on the other side waves. 

"We'll start off easy. You swing from that swing towards me, and I'll catch your hands. Then you can jump from me to this platform. Okay?"

**lapost48** - *2017-11-17*

"Sounds simple enough." The Laguz near ZaRel throws the swing forward and ZaRel waits for it to swing back. Right before it gets to the nearest part of it's swing he jumps and grasps the swing with both hands. However, one of his hands looses purchase as his weight pulls on it. Barely holding on with one hand he reaches the far end of the swing where he sees the second Laguz on the second swing. He realizes that he doesn't have the momentum to reach her with his slipped hand. ZaRel rides the swing back to the original.platform and hope onto the platform again.

"I didn't realize it would be that round. I was surprised by the shape of the swing. I'll get it next time." ZaRel claims with a significant air of confidence

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

The man below slumps his shoulders as ZaRel gets back on solid ground. He had dove forward to catch ZaRel in case he fell. "Girls, I don't think this a good idea." he sighs.

"Yeah hun, you've got nothing to prove." the woman by ZaRel says, kneeling slightly to be on eye level with ZaRel. 

(ooc: I'm leaving this to you, you can try again or listen to the others. If you'd like to go again, we'll have you roll agile acrobat.)

**lapost48** - *2017-11-17*

"If succeeding in this trick is what it takes to come along with you then that is what I will do. To be honest, I've never actually been to the circus to watch this so that try was a learning experience. I know I'll be able to do it this time!"

(ooc: let's roll this shizznit)

ZaRel steps back, "Just watch." He leaps off the platform backwards doing a backflip. He passes through the ropes holding the swing up flipping over the swing and grabbing it as his flip completes. While he swings towards the second swing he releases one of his hands and quickly releases the swing with the other to spin himself around to face the right way. Grabbing on with the second hand again he leaps off of the swing corkscrewing his body a full rotation. The rotation ends with his hands perfectly aligned with the Laguz woman swinging from the other swing. As he nears the second platform he is released by the woman and does one more flip before landing one the platform.

Upon landing he nearly loses his balance and takes a small step backwards towards the edge of the platform, but manages to prevent himself from falling.

"See, I just needed a dry run. I could use a little advice on the landing though."

`[End Aside]`

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

```Characters: Aldus, Nokri, (anyone else at the inn who wanna join idk)
Location: The Violet Light's Rest
Aside START```

The already muffled voices in the hall were getting more and more distant. It seems they moved to one of the rooms. Nokri briefly entertained a scandalous thought. She sat for a minute, wondering what to do. Walking straight by them and saying "oh, what a coincidence. I'm on my way to the bathroom what are you talking about," would be far too obvious. They'd probably kick her out of the inn. But what were they talking about? What if they were talking about her? 
She slowly and sliently creaked her door open a crack. The hallway was entirely hushed now aside from the din of chatter downstairs and settling noises of the building. Which rooms were the others in, again? Maybe it was on the other side where she couldn't see.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

Aldus feels unsatisfied with Elirans excuses for not telling him about himself but he wasn't going to press the issue further, the man had a point. Well he isn't going to stay here, he has his own room. He walks back out into the hallway being sure to close and lock the door behind him. His coversation with Desii had left him light, his conversation with Eliran the opposite. He turns and begins to head down the hallway to his own private room.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

There was a click, and the sound of another door opening. Nokri quickly escaped back into her room so as not to get caught. *Wait. What am I hiding from? I'm not doing anything wrong.*
Once again she opened the door, this time partially walking out into the hallway to see who else was there. The dog guy was coming out of a room and walking down the hall. He didn't exactly look happy. "Ah. It's you," she stated. "Hey. Is that Eliran's room? What is he doing?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

Nokri rushes out of the room to Aldus's left, starling him a bit. She greats him dryly before asking a few too many questions about their teal haired companian. "Yes? He's trying to sleep, you know like most people do at this hour. What are you so excited about anyway?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

*Wow. Someone is grumpy.* She expected him to start growling or bearing his fangs.
"What's got you so uptight? Did you not enjoy dinner? I thought it was rather lovely. Plus, we each have our own rooms so I don't have to deal with your snoring." The snoring bit was sarcasm and meant to be a special brand of Nokri Joke™, but was delivered flatly. 
"Did you know about him?" she asked curiously, nodding in the direction of Eliran's room.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

*Oh yes because you're such a ray of sunshine* Aldus bites back bitterly. "You're one to talk" he mutters before Nokri can ask her real question. No point in hiding it he supposes. "No, I just thought he was a guy who wandered around playing music and warming beds, and occasionally delivered a letter or two when the gigs weren't paying well. I'm guessing you didn't know either from your face when he announced it ."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

"Yep. That makes two of us, then. Wonderful." It was weird seeing the dog boy upset. He was usually not upset. Nokri didn't quite know how to respond, but it would suck if his sour mood continued and dragged everyone else down. Especially in front of their wealthy friends.
"How does that make you feel?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

"Strange, I don't know why he he'd hide this from me but he doesn't seem to want us to treat him differently because of what he was born into. I suppose I can relate to that" he says a little somberly.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

"Oh, can you now?" Nokri pried, perhaps still a bit elated from their drinks with dinner. "How so?" she asked. She retreated a step back into the room, the ground of which was littered with grass and random plants she had plucked along their route like a flora-loving kleptomaniac. She held the door open invitingly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

*what a lightweight* he thinks noting her mood,. Still, drunk and happy is better than dealing with her sober and grumpy. She holds open the door to her room, revealing a wide array of plants on the floor. He keeps his smart remarks regarding the mess to himself as he enters. He chuckles "Im a laguz who can't do the one thing that set us apart from humans, that didn't go over too well with my parents and peers, I *may* have idea what its like to not want to be judged for the way you simply *are*"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

Nokri takes a seat on the ground under the window, pushing aside a pile of pine leaves with her foot in the process. She gestures for him to take a seat anywhere. Ordinarily she'd never let someone in her room, there would be too many things she considered valuable or secrets she didn't want seen. But now that her stuff was gone it really didn't matter. "Wow, how tragic," she lamented in the same flat tone of voice. "And how does *that* make you feel?"
She picked up a random bowl she was working on earlier. It was some kind of tea, what with boiled leaves sitting in water. She sniffed it a moment and offered it to Aldus if he was thirsty.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

Nokri gestures for him to sit down which is... different. She feigns some concern for his plight but is obvious she doesn't actually care, probably just trying to find out more things that could be used against him if need be. She offers him some strange looking tea, shoving it toward him a little clumsily in her tipsiness. the smell is very... unpleasant  "Oh uh... no thank you. I had mint tea earlier before..." he trails off while taking a seat in the desk chair just as he did in Desii's room earlier.  "Why are you asking anyway?" he says as gently as possibly, not wanting to provoke the small woman. "you've never taken much interest in me before this."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-27*

"I've had an interest," she retorted. The more information one has, the stronger they are. She shrugged at his refusal of her drink and downed a sip of it herself. Her face contorted for a moment. Too bitter. "Not exactly much time to act on it, though. Someone is always getting into trouble." She rolled her eyes. *Desii is always causing one mess or another.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-27*

"Ah yes and what someone could that be?" he answers before his mind has time to catch up with the first thing she said. "W-wait what?" *Interested? What in the ancestors graves does that mean?!* He feels a bit of heat rise to his cheeks. "Look if you're trying to get something out of me, there isn't much to get. I'm not the heir to any fortune, and any position of power I once had a chance a is now completely shot."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-27*

"Oh, don't play dumb. Ever since we picked up that brunette she's been causing all sorts o- ...what?" Nokri side-eyed him, slightly confused by his overreaction.  She narrowed her eyes and pouted. "You still owe me if I help you fix your problem. Don't give up your goal, you can still regain a position of power." If he did that, Nokri would be pleased to have more powerful connections. She stood up, staring in his eyes and standing as intimidatingly as she could muster for a calm 5 foot tall girl in pajamas. "You *are* still interested in fixing that issue, yeah?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-27*

"Well, yes of course. But I doubt those back home will take me back even If I do gain the the ability to transform, Its all kind of complicated at this point." Maybe he should have stayed quite about mentioning losing the position his father groomed him for. "Desii has done nothing but help from my view, she even helped come rescue you, a woman she just met, and tended to your wounds thanklessly. You'd do well to give her a chance, or is their a particular reason for your distaste? You'll get more bees with honey Nokri. Don't devalue the power of having friends" He says this calmly, the small woman's stance doing little to intimidate the much taller man, even if he was currently seated.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-27*

With a disappointed "hmmmph" Nokri sat down again, still pointing her narrowed eyes at Aldus. This time she was seated more in the center of the room. "You can think what you want. I think she's a walking risk. I'd be frankly shocked if she hasn't concussed herself multiple times just by tripping. You seem to appreciate her company a lot, though." Nokri smirked. "Is she your type?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-27*

Aldus watches amused as Nokri plops down on her bed with a huff like small child angry at their parent for scolding them, she seems to ignore his first statement altogether choosing to focus on only parts about Desii, which Aldus finds quite curious. "Is she your type?" Nokri asks sounding bothered, and not in the way she usually sounds bothered either, no this is different.  Aldus chuckles nervously "My *type*? I'm.... not quite sure I have a type. I mean, I used to have a girlfriend. So it's not like I haven't experienced anything like that before but I think it'd be hard so say what my *type* really is. There were things I didnt like about her aswell so if I had to list things I'd like too see in  a partner then perhaps I'd say I would like them to be kind, accepting, strong in their own right. I would like to be able to share jokes and stories with them, and keep no secrets. But I suppose that doesn't really answer your question and I've only just met Desii so I cannot.  W-why do you ask? What's your type then?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-27*

She went wide-eyed and snickered. *Really? A girlfriend?* The more she thought about it, the more it caused her to giggle, nearly falling over. Dog boy was really opening up tonight. Nokri wish she had more of the weird tea to quell her laughter, but it was too far away at this point and she didn't want to bother getting it. Aldus then proceeded to list the most ridiculous qualities for a partner she'd ever heard. "Mmhmm. Okay. Good luck finding miss perfect," she managed to speak before another fit of giggles.
"And who, me? You think I have any interest in that?" After scratching her head for a moment, Nokri came up with a basic list of necessities for any person she'd date. *I might be aiming high but at least my expectations are realistic," she determined. "I'd be happy to find someone with a stable income" *who makes a ton of dough* "and who is in fine fettle. I don't want an idiot who goes slashing swords at everything and expects me to patch them up 3 times a day. At that point the relationship just becomes a job." Maybe she could find work as the exclusive doctor of a rich idiot. That would be fine.
 "You really had a girlfriend? Wasn't Mr. Famous Trading Company™ your boyfriend or something?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-27*

Laying his heart to bear is unsurprisingly met with with a fit of giggles and a mocking comment. Her next response is even more confusing though "You think I have any interest in that?" she asks incredulously before she mulls it over.
"If you don't like my answer then why would you even ask?! Proper companionship is hardly a high standard" he says, hurt. "Well something provoked you to ask such a question, its only fair you be able to answer your own question."

"Realistic? I suppose. If that's your type then perhaps you should speak to Eliran yourself , as he is assuredly not mine. Or perhaps Sir Faun? That we met tonight? A knight's salary would be quite decent, especially an Eraian Knight's. They are both fit as well it would seem." Aldus answers tone matching her own a few moments ago. Then  folds his arms over his chest and continues "But let me ask you this - where is the connection in money and appearances? Do you think these things are a cure for loneliness? Only a true connection can quell that. To answer your last question yes, I had a girlfriend, Is that so hard to believe? I know Naissankari aren't common down here but I don't think I fall anywhere short on appearances of Eliran, or the knight and surely no others we've crossed paths with"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-28*

"Money can buy companionship. But hey, that's deep."
He seemed defensive, and was that pain in his voice? Oops. *Was it something I said?* She tried to mill over his words. Was he still angry about their rich travelling companion hiding his rich secret? Or maybe Nokri wounded his masculine pride. Guys were weird. She was so thankful to be out of the military surrounded by them. 
"Did I cross a boundary? My apologies. And sure, I bet you're a real hunk among your... pack." Nokri was fairly certain that was the word he used. She was proud of her political correctness in a tense situation. "You're all muscle-y, aren'tcha? Girls dig that." She quickly reached over to pull his shirt up, as though to show him that he's not pudgy or out of shape. 
In the process, an unnatural scar near his waist caught her eye. "Has that always been there?" she asked suspiciously, not recalling having seen it before.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

*Did she just apologize? Tonight is very strange* he thinks to himself, but its about to get stranger.  "Dig that?" he questions, never having heard heard the phrase before.  As she approaches him he unfolds his arms and leans away from her, uncertain of what she's about to do.  "What-" he's interrupted by Nokri unceremoniously lifting his tunic, revealing his abdomen. He inhales sharply at her touch, as she's never touched him outside of the necessary before. Now the heat in his face is obvious.  She gawks openly at his exposed abdomen. The phrase 'my eyes are up here' briefly comes to mind but before he can get it out he realizes her attention turning to his right side where the scar of a nasty gash displays itself. 

"Has that always been there?" she asks with a strange tone, like a mother asking where all the cookies went.

She reaches out to touch the skin just around it but before she can he grabs her wrist gentle and directs it away from him, prompting her to step back. Aldus covers himself again and stands. "Well, it was assuredly there the last time you saw me shirtless, although you were quite drunk then too so perhaps you didn't notice. Its... months old at this point but I'd prefer not to talk about it tonight." He's already divulged enough about himself for one night.  

"I should get going, It's quite late and I have business to attend to in the morning"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-02*

Her wrist was redirected to the air, like a parent swatting their kid away from something expensive without sending their kid into a tantrum. Nokri pursed her lips and stared at him. An improperly treated scar. Tsk tsk. 
"Another time, then."
She strode over to the door and opened it, as though to kindly show him out after a cordial conversation among friends. Though it looked more like she was kicking him out and waiting for him to leave. "What is this business?" she quipped, curiosity getting the better of her once again.

As he left, she gave one final "good night" before shutting and locking the door. The lock was cool.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-02*

Aldus returns to his own room after a much longer night of discussions than he had planned for. He breathes out heavily and sits down on the bed, running his hands over his face and rubbing his tired eyes. He looks up and is met with the reflection of his own image in the forgotten mirror on the wall. He rises back off the bed and pulls his shirt off, approaching the mirror. His form is well defined, Nokri was right about that but he knows that. No the uneasiness he’s feeling now is due to the scar which she asks about. Wrapping itself around his side, the trained eye can probably tell it's from teach or claws, perhaps Nokri was able to divulge that much herself just a few minutes ago. He runs his fingers over the pink and white mark, the sensation strange even almost 2 years later. He still remembers that day clearly though:

“Maybe I just don’t have a wolf form, father. I just don’t! Maybe it’s never going to happen” Aldus exclaims after hours of sparring with his father outside near the house in attempt to get trigger his wolf form. 

“Aldus Larian, nothing is wrong with you, you just need more time” his mother tries to interject.

“No Kata, he’s right something *is* wrong with him. He’s a failure as a laguz, a disgrace to our people, he’s *broken*”

“Eldrem please, he’s your son!”

“Is he Kata? Maybe he isn’t! Or am I misremembering you spending a lot of time with that human the year he was born? It would explain while he can’t do the one thing that should come most naturally to him!”

Aldus stands between the two of them confused and angry, how can his father even say that? He has his father’s eyes even others in Roren have told him he looks just like his father did when he was his age.

“Oh you just can’t let that go can you Eldrem? It’s been 20 years, Two decades, you have a problem”

“I have a problem? No Kata he has the problem” his father turns to him “You - you have the problem son” his tone drips with malice Aldus feels his temper rise, he grits his teeth.

“Why can’t you just accept me the way I am!? How can you say these things to me, to Mother?!” He turns away, “I’ve always looked up  to you but, maybe you’re right maybe I’m not your son!” 

All of a sudden a pain unlike anything he’s felt before strikes in him his right side, he doubles over and then hits the ground. His mother moves between him and his father, but she’s in her wolf form now growling and snapping at his father, another wolf form darts past him which he recognizes at his father before his vision fades to black.
