**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-09-04*

Afina Tyndall (22) - Georgia
Human
4 - If You Can’t Make Them See the Light... (Afina’s childhood tutor was a member of the clergy; as a result, Afina was exposed to light magic at an early age, despite minimal religious affiliation. The kingdom of Laera has no official religion, but rather believes that knowledge is the key to living a complete, full life, and one should be more concerned with the knowledge they gain in life than what happens to their soul after death)
4 - Make Them Feel the Heat (Spirited and stubborn, Afina is the last person to get into an argument with. She sticks to her guns at all costs, and believes that she’s the most qualified to speak about almost any matter. There’s few she yields to in an argument, usually only mentors and occasionally family members. Her haughty nature is what put her in her current situation anyways.)
4 - Better Read Than Dead (Assumes everything is like it is in the books, meaning random trivia and niche subject matters are her forte. Otherwise, common sense things can sometimes go over her head) 
1 - Water You Talking About (Afina only recently became serious about her status as next in line for the throne; Her [family member] was declared lost at sea three years ago. Bringing up the situation makes her aggressive about opening up about it. It has also caused her to have a deep fear of ships and maritime affairs.)

**Rayna** - *2017-09-05*

Corrina "Rin" Erebus - Rayna
Cat Laguz Halfbreed

5. - Trait #1 : 
          Rogue Survivalist - Expose the enemy's weak point and strike them down. Cause the most damage with minimal effort while being light on your feet. With dual blades and poisons, anything is possible. Evaluate what battles to fight in and what battles to run from. When you know where to look any prison is escapable. 
3. - Trait #2 : 
    Catlike Reflexes - Enjoys the sight of shiny objects and becomes drawn to it (especially if it’s currency.) Is prone to falling asleep after eating a meal but has a tendency to be very agitated by hunger if it is an issue. Head scratches causes “purring” and does not like to be touched or held unless it is by someone she trusts.
3. - Trait #3 :
    Ignorance is Not Bliss - Growing up in an secluded estate has limited the knowledge of the outside world. Because of this, whatever thought or action first comes to mind is immediately put into motion. She says things bluntly and does not understand why you "do not say what you mean". Has a tendency to offend many customs but is open to learning...unless it’s stupid to her.
3. - Trait #4 :
    Family Deals - Helping those in need is fine but what makes that action even better is if you can get something out of it. When you have the skills never do it for free. 
1. - Weakness :
    Unrelenting Stubbornness  - Telling her to stop can be a problem whether it is recreational, such as being dared to do something stupid, or revenge. Those who have wronged her are doomed to feel her wrath as she will not stop until her intended task or target is dealt with. She needs to know that her target has been dealt with or she will forever think about it.

Tikur Triune Ishkabible 
Wolf Laguz

5 - Trait 1: Tactical Thinker (Has been in many arena battles with his brother so he will size up opponents and use what is the best strategy for the group.  Can sometimes treat real battles like arena battles and not think of the consequenses.)
3 - Trait 2: Moves like a cat (Tikur learned the ins and outs of his wolf form with his cat foster parents. He moves and fights more like a cat than a wolf, light on his feet and graceful. Sometimes his larger form keeps him from moving the way he needs to though.) 
3 - Trait 3:  Balanced Fighter (Has used magic and swordsmanship in many battles and is very comforatble and quick to switch between magical tomes and combat. He's just sometimes not quick enough..."you wanna know how i got these scars?")
3 - Trait 4: Practice Makes Perfect (Will always make sure that he has done at least an hour of practicing swordsmanship and magic.  Even if he is worn out and exhausted he will practice, sometimes making injuries worse, or straining himself.)

**Heroth** - *2017-09-10*

Ewan the Broken Black Mage
Race: Human
Specialty: Necromancy

5 - It's good to give 'em a name, makes 'em easier to work wi- MURPHY NO! - (Ewan has dedicated his life to the art of Necromancy, as such he has mastery over summoning the undead and control his summon, Murphy [the name Ewan has given to the life force that inhabits the flesh and bones used for his summon]. Ewan has an array of tomes to make use of Murphy for problem solving and combat, but limited utility and spells outside of summons)

4-If I cannot bring Knoll back, then we will not find peace until my sins are redeemed- (Ewan’s is highly motivated and feels responsible to stop the Dryn expansion and kill his mentor, who he feels betrayed his trust. Now a caucious loner, Ewan cannot form strong bonds, but hes also harder to trick or persuade. Ewan feels obligated to help those affected by Dryn, but he views everything, and everyone else as a distraction)

3 - Our memories keep loved ones alive- (Knoll's spirit follows Ewan and is in tune with the dead. Acting as a cat, It can mark people or places of interest. It can feel for an evil presence, or channel a restless soul for communication. Some spirits should be left alone, and straining evil or restless souls can have terrible consequences)

1- The undead have a funky smell- (Dark magic is considered taboo on its own, but necromancy is often considered the unholiest of disciplines to master. Not everyone Ewan meets in his travels will embrace him)

4 -But being a wolf is so much better (must use her wolf form in order to hunt, track, and scout. She has no knowledge of how to do these things while in human form because her pack has only trained her to do these things as a wolf)

3 - This is my travel song~  (I love to sing and I sound like a goddess when I do, but when I travel I will always sing ---> which will typically sound like howling because I only really travel in wolf form).

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-11-20*

Ello I have a character now 
Name: Eliron Cantaret 
Race: Human   Age: 26 
4 - Deadshot: As a member of the Cantaret, Mobius has been trained in how to make, maintain, and use a special Composite bow (Idea based of Mongol Composite Bow).  
4 - Deadly Playing/Don’t touch me Lute: Has a lute with a small blade in it thats used for emergencies
4 - Definitely up to no good: Along with his performative and martial abilities, Mobius has picked up a bad habit as a poor boy, which is that of a pickpocket, and lockpick. 
1 - Doesn’t Even Lift: While Mobius can be quick, and is good with his hands, his upbringing as a poor fallen noble meant that he didn’t grow up strong. In fact, beyond when he uses his bow, he is kinda weak, and while he can handle his luggage well enough, it's a bit much to expect him to do any strenuous lifting.

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Name: Desii Manette
Race: Callorian Human

Aspects:
5 - I just... can do it you know? (Desii is naturally intelligent. She catches on to technique and theory quickly and rarely need to study or practice them for a good understand of them. People who study and practice their way to the top can find this natural ability annoying.)
4 - Magic is for the study, not the battlefield (Desii is an anima pupil, though she is close to the level of a Mage. She has no experience using magic outside of an academic setting.)
3 - Medic! Oh wait, that's me. (Desii has injured herself. a lot. She's skilled with first aid in the non magical sense. Its an unfortunately talent, given why she has it.)
1 - What's the opposite of cat's grace? (Desii is the farthest thing from a cat in the sense she never lands on her feet. Her fine motor skills are one thing, but anything that requires coordination of her whole body tends to escape her.)

Background: http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/12/20/desii-backstory.html

Aspects:  I'm translating the character sheet from Fate Accelerated to Wushu's ruleset. The approaches lined up right over the potential 6 traits in Wushu. Aspects in Fate do a few things, primarily you can say 'because I'm the king of a kingdom, I should get a bonus giving a speech' or I can say 'because you're king of the kingdom, you can't leave in the middle of the invasion' and there'd be a bonus or penalty involved. Wushu lacks a bonus implementation beyond more dice, so how I'm going to implement a bonus I'm not sure.
Approaches: Everyone starts with a 2 in each of their approaches. An approach can be any number between 1 and 5. You get 6 points to add to the approaches, and you may reduce up to two of the approaches to 1 to get an additional point. 
Aspects: The aspects you had before. There are 3 to 5.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

**Afina Tyndall**
Female Human 22 years old
---
**Traits**
IF YOU CAN'T MAKE THEM SEE THE LIGHT, MAKE THEM FEEL THE HEAT
Afina's spirited and stubborn nature drives her to be a highly proficient light mage. Off the battlefield, it makes her highly devoted to the causes she supports, but impossible to compromise with. 

BETTER READ THAN DEAD
Afina is very well educated, and often well-read in topics that others may find niche or irrelevant. She has spent much of her life reading, which means her intellect spans many diverse subject matters. However, this has reflected poorly on her social skills, and common sense. Afina can be awkward when approaching others, and often struggles for extended periods of time to make decisions.

GOD SAVE THE PRINCESS
Afina is extremely loyal to her kingdom, and is often concerned with what is right for "her people". This makes her a fierce champion of Laeran ideals, and a princess loved by all her citizens. But it also causes the princess to have extremely high expectations of herself, to the degree that she is susceptible to manipulation if it meant that the welfare of the kingdom were at stake. 

TREATED WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE
Afina has a predisposed hostility towards the laguz species as a result of traumatic childhood events. As a result, she is reluctant to cooperate with laguz individuals, and is even skeptical of their motivations after the fact. In combat, she is hesitant to battle laguz opponents, but when forced to, fights with extra malice.
