why this channel empty
it snow tomorrow
perfect for heading outside in the freezing cold to get snowy cosplay photos

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-08*

XD isnt that what kon kons for?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-08*

true :0

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-08*

speaking of i need to cut the heart in my nora shirt bit im afraid of it fraying üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-08*

but what if no snow at konkon we gotta strike while the iron is hot and the snow is frozen, because maybe if we iron our clothes right beforehand the heat will linger a bit

hmmmmmmmmm. do you have fray check or could you line the hole with ribbon or something?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-08*

whats fray check? üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

fray check keeps fabric from fraying

It's sorta like a glue w/o sticking things together

It just hardens

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-08*

:0
it's like
yeah it's a smelly liquid that does that

but if the thing is super mega frayable it won't help, but regular fabric it ought to work

my friend cosplays every single version of yona and when we last got a huge snowstorm she ran out in the princess outfit to get pictures. trooper.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-08*

its like a lycra cotton blend

could i just cover the trim in fabric glue in that case?

Good thing I'm not a pro

**Bill** - *2017-12-13*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-13*

Woah. Is that pro cosplayer whoozica!?

**Bill** - *2017-12-13*

I did at Colossal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-13*

Lmao yea right

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-13*

We had a really super elaborate scheme planned for last Katsucon. I can't remember all of it but it was something.
A friend cosplaying from yona was angry at someone who they thought was their friend but later went and spread rumors behind their back and started spewing cosplay superiority stuff (like "don't Cosplay if you don't have the body" and stuff like that - they cosplayed the same character) so friend wanted revenge. Friend wound up with a harem of people constantly talking about how adoring they are and kissed bad person's girlfriend in front of a ton of people at the shoot. 
And then everybody applauded. (There was no applause that was a meme but the rest happened)

Like, friend would offhandedly mention being thirsty and five people from the adoring harem would offer up water bottles it was beautiful

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-13*

Wtfffff lmao

**Bill** - *2017-12-13*



When do I get the badge of approval that I beat your wedding photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-13*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-13*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-14*

I guess parkour is technically the art of getting from one location to the other in the fastest way possible

so in theory

you arent wrong..

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-14*

nice explanation. parkour.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-15*

For? Photos?

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

Yeah.

Leanna wanted actual Yang photos for Ethan's contest. So I'm going to go *basically to princeton* to shoot for her Sunday. Not going to have time to do it tomorrow, nor will I want to.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-15*

Oof

Don't over due yourself

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

Hahahaha I already did.

Where there's a will there's a way right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

YO PHOTOS

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

No Georgia thing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

I would but I should study for finals after hal leave Sunday

*shows up to shoot* I missed you so much

Boom have to let me stay

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

If you finished v4 Weiss maybe.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Cries that's a project for winter break

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

You say that like I'd ever send you away. ü§∑

So it's just. I feel bad, anytime Leanna has been around she's kind fallen to the background. Since she contacted me I want to really get her some foreground attention.

2B at colossal turned into 8bs. Kogara was so much personality she faded into the background.

So. Leanna gets Yang shoot.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-15*

**Bill** - *2017-12-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-16*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-16*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

yo do you guys thing nora's jacket is really dark navy blue, or black?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

hm. really really super dark blue?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

yea thats what i thought too

I found a pattern i think will work, how much fabric should i buy :o?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

a yard and a half should be good, two yards to be safe? but i always get like triple what i need because paranoia

georgia pls weigh in

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

2 yards because safe

Yangs v1 jacket is similar and I did that in 1 and 1/4

But that was dumb luck

If you can afford 2 yards then do it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

coo tank

so like if a pattern says its only for one type of fabric, do you absolutely have to use it with type?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Nahhhhh

Sometimes tho depends

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

like its say "only for stretch knit", but i was thinking maybe stretch denim?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Yeah that's probably ok

I would allow a little more seam allowance to compensate

You can always make a garment that's too big fit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

coo coo thnx grl

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Fun drinking games, take a shot every time labinnak promotes her holiday card

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

I'll play, lets go.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

im already ded

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

same rules applies to as it does Georgia Jess, if you get all super famous-ee and bitchy I'mma call you out.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

lmao i would be so awkward

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

That's why bill calls me out every day :V

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

you'd know if I'm calling you out for that tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

ok another fabrics question

what is broadcloth?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

well its a *cloththatsbroad*

(ill be here all week)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

gtfo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

It's a really basic fabric that comes in a lot of colors that's cheap

It's convenient for all those reasons, but it's thin-ness means it usually has to be doubled up to be effective

Also it's easy to sweat through it

And it's not very comfy

My yang jacket is party broadcloth

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

Would it work for like stripes and cuffs and things like that?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Yeah probably

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

Ok cool

<@351785752197201920>  go buy everything in the Amazon cart for me pls??

I don't remember wtf was on the ground

Only that yato was sad about wasting food

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

labinnak liked the holiday card i posted is this fame

YATO NO

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

cream cheese.

Does Labinnak follow everyone but me.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

Not I fren

No guys aloud

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

she doesn't follow me i got a like woooo i expect a chceck in the mail with all my millions now for being famous

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

I think she's lurking on the Christmas rwby tag

She liked my lilth pic too though

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

ü§∂

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-18*

She doth not follow me

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

Not guys allowed

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

Whoa coincidences she follows no guys

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-19*

calleddatshit

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-19*

she follows like a few

namely people she seems to have met

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-19*

yeahh

i mean

**Bill** - *2017-12-19*

I met her.

I said 'do you know Georgia.'

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-19*

*cosplayers she seems to have met

i don't think mangaloo acknowledges non-cosplayers as people

hence the snubbing of Ethan's business that doesn't cosplay, but makes cosplay weapons 
anybody who aids in cosplay making/photography but aren't cosplayers are servants

at least as following goes

**Bill** - *2017-12-19*

she has her token few. There's one photographer I think she's friends with.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-19*

-is looking through she follows-

yeah its either fem cosplayers, male cosplayers she knows, or people she friends or works with

**Bill** - *2017-12-19*

she might hate guys?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-19*

i doubt it

**Bill** - *2017-12-19*

con land is full of quirks.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-19*

its probably unconscious

at least the no guy part

the snubbing of others is definitely intentional

**Bill** - *2017-12-19*

she'd make a great idol.

They're basically banned from interacting with me outside of fan events.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

It's been a busy year

So ill post my Christmas vlog tomorrow at noon lol

8 pm is also apparently the most effective hour

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

ah, but those stats don't coorelate to when you posted the liked post.

that's when people like things, not when you post them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

True

I post around 1-2 pm usually

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

9 times out 10 I'm mentioned on those so I just see them that way.

well, less than that. Least until I get you a backlog of Weiss's.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

Ya bill let's do a Weiss shoot I actually had a fun idea

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

according to this little info graphic i have one my desk for social media posting the best time for insta is between 5-6 pm

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

*the fun idea is taking photos of her*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

_no it's actually fun_

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Jess, be my social media manager.

*is it*

*why am I typing in italics.*

*help me*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

I saw that at one point but also my demographic is apparently largely high schoolers

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

lol why? you seem to do fine on your own

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

So they get out between 2-3 so if I post 1-2 I'll be one of the first posts on their feed

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

Is that yours Marisa

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

I can't wait for someone to typo tilt worm as tit worm.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-21*

most of my facebook likes seem to be older guys üòø

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-21*

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

I mean. It's a huge dip on my stats.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-21*

akihabara 16 said they shut down yet i still get emails from them about idol shows why

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

so while it was good, it wasn't good for instagram.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

July makes sense cause RTX made me a little popular

Idk why August outperformed July tho

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Did I get JNPR back then? I don't think so.

Cause JNPR blew up for Gen.

nope, JNPR was in september.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

there there.

We can't all be INstAGraM FAmOUs WezReZ CosPlaY.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

if you look closely you can see exactly which posts arent cosplay posts

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

Jim gaffigan voice: *Why do I always type it like that. it's hard to type it like that.*

pssh.

The regular photography posts are what pull down my average.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

thursdays at 4 is my best time apparently

but there really isnt much data to go off of

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-21*

Yeah any few personal posts I make don't get good traction

Tho the photoshoot in Princeton I did as just me got decent likes

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

I mean. It's not that surprising.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

i only have like 17 posts so ye

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-21*

*slams fist on table to demand more posts*

i'm debating posting regular everyday stuff after i move because all my posts are currently cosplay

maybe i'll get super lucky and run into the best cosplayer in the world again

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

All cosplay makes sense for a cosplay account.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-21*

uguu

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

I'm the idiot for splitting topics.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-21*

im still amazed everytime a high school classmate likes a cosplay post

im like  "what are you still doing here"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-21*

wait the best cosplayer in the world at that time was from mexico
maybe they were just the best japanese cosplayer
my life is a lie

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-23*

i was looking at pictures of me in 2nd grade today I have the same issue
maybe I should stick to costumes with fursuit heads in the future #notafurry

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

*I love the smell of guilt trips in the morning*

Marisa, you are most likely a furry.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-23*

anime characters don't have lines on their faces *how can I be teh animes if I'm only human*

you forgot the not in that sentence

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

dropping image clarity and contrast does have an effect of hiding facial lines.

It doesn't look good.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-23*

I think my favorite picture of you marisa is the Omae wa mou shindieru from the skating

(totally spelled that wrong but eh)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-23*

As Ethan as yet to realize, it's not about whose modelling and about *whats being modelled*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Eh ethan cares about follower count

Which means yes I could try Jess' if we're the same size

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

its a medium, a lil big one me i was planning on bringing it in tho

im not insta famous enough for that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-27*

Yeah Ethan's pretty strict about business promotion

Which makes me surprised he wanted me to be Official Model‚Ñ¢

And Ye I can try it

**Bill** - *2017-12-27*

Mangaloo turned him down after all.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-27*

So heres the thing <@!245270932602486784>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-27*

**Bill** - *2017-12-28*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-28*

Someone low key asked if they could send me something so I looked into it

It's 14 for 3 months and 26 for 6 months so I was like

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

If enough people are interested I'll rent one

**Bill** - *2017-12-28*

oh ye you insta famous.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-28*

I feel like we had this conversation on here already, but is broadcloth too light of a material for ren's jacket? not really sure what a "better" material would be

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-28*

its a light material, so youd have to double up the amount of fabric to make it thicker

its doable, but not preferable

youre better off using the matte side of a casa satin fabric

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-28*

Ahh kk thankkk

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-29*

gotchu



HNGH what do I do about this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

it me

shit girl idk internet ppl freak me out

somebody added me the other day and they were like "yo if i give you me psn can we be frens" and i was like im gonna pretend that didn't happen

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

have you ever met this person or heard of them before or knew about their existence

for some reason a lot of people like to see themselves as good friends of internet personalities (like youtubers or artists) whereas the internet person has no idea that the person exists and it gets weird because they think they know a lot about you and you know nothing about them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

thats a good wisdom

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-29*

they are just so entranced by the famous wezrez is all

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-29*

Marisa that is the wisest thing I've ever heard GGüëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-29*

Cuz dey lik o shee kyut

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

o tank

**Bill** - *2017-12-29*

Follows are not friendships.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

Tell that to the internet peeps

**Bill** - *2017-12-29*

Ooh, sick me on the wezrez army. I'll tell em... I dunno.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

‚ÄúThe only one allowed to be friends with Instagram famous Wezrez cosplay is I, tilt worm. Back off plebs.‚Äù

**Bill** - *2017-12-29*

Clearly I'm the pleb.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-29*

**Bill** - *2017-12-29*

I dunno. I messaged Andoru and Mari-chan too but everyone blew my nervous butt off.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

i didnt even have an insta then XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

<:dva_salt:365521119534645254>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

so bill was forced to meet me A L O N E

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

except Hal was there.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-02*

Not quite

I was there to support Bill

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

... u right

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

That's a weird way of spelling Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

had you guys met before?

yea right?

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

a few conversations at Zenkaikon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

psh

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

On my part, awkward ones.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

we knew you'd do great and were just being self conscious

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-02*

I am like the red cross 
We give support to both sides to lower casualties

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

"these damn RWBYs with their 'Ded Pyro'"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-02*

I mean Bill, Georgia and I weren't even dating yet

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

were you not, really?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

so much nervousness in one location would have actually killed tom and i

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

I went to princeton heavily leaning on the 'they're dating' side.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-02*

"We're actually not "together-together..."" -Nora

when did princeton happen again

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

we started dating july 17th

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

If Mak told me the right time, a week after you started dating.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

yeeeet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

I'm home sick today so I should be able to comb the reaches of the internet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

tbh today was supposed to be my relax day but my mom broke her hand and needs me to do errands and ethan kept bothering me about doing a livestream in yang cosplay and im like UGH

u so lucky

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Oh noüò≠

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Oh jeez. Hope you're Mom is alright.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Your mom was telling me about her hand the other day

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

ethanplz

and that sucks

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Srsly bra

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

*not that he needs a model to highlight his weapons*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

ya ethan wanted me and casey to be yang and blake while he has a livestream where, somewhere in it, he plays i burn on the guitar

makes me kinda feel like arm candy but

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

,...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Yea lil bit üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

we still need to fight him for the right to cosplay ren

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

tom you are just _so ren_ tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

You allready won

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

>w>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

and on top of this i wanted to work on v4 weiss but now everyone _is stealing my time to work_

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

I'm really starting to think Ethan started the whole business just to be instagram famous.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

yeah tbh I really like Ethan's Adam more anyways

he totally did though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

yeah ethans adam is best

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

he's a good enough craftsman, and the kind of guy I can see wanting to do work like that to make some cash.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

hes def not doing it for the money, he made that part clear to me like 45 times

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

45 TIMES LOL

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

But the last month was about contests. Now he's on to live streams, patreons, and guest stars who have plenty of followers. He's not actually doing anything with the weaponry.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

drunk ethan tends to repeat himself

***IN A TEXAN ACCENT***

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

^^^^^

bill callin it like it is

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/1002746/android/sticker.png;compress=true

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

im glad at least bill will call me on bullshit if it ever gets to that point

very observant

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Speaking of.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

oh yeah, hell shut that shit down

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Remember the whole telling people no thing?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

>w> ^^^

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

You might want to if he keeps it up.

You have a massive line up of cosplay to work on in your own right. You aren't obligated and imo shouldn't be his poster girl.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Yea gurl take care of you self

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

thank fren

yeah hal says the same thing

"*hal voice* youre too nice and i love that about you but you have to think about you sometimes"

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Where's Andoru to call me on my unsolicited advice giving habit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

I distinctly remember Hal saying " Georgia can't do anything Wednesday that's a me time day for her"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

literally he asked me about this livestream every day multiple times

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

yeah..

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

and i was like BOI THAT TAKES SO MUCH OUT OF MY SCHEDULE

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Just say you can't. period.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

yeah cause i gotta get yang one and drive up there and drive back and sit there and be pretty like F U C K let me work on weiss in peace

and then a billion other people wanna hang out so i have to cram them in after work

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

I mean he's pushy as hell but he's not a dick.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

and then people are throwin baby fits because they wanna see me more and im like _bruh i physically do not have the time_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Just break out the tears

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

:/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

like yo i get it im very loved and people want to see me but i have my own shit

like i have a friend leaving for military training on the 8th and i havent been able to say goodbye to him yet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Ye, it gets hard balencing friends and work and school and life and agghhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

ya and then people get mad at me like

w h a t

like justin didnt come to my party but still wants me to work on cosplay FOR him on thursday

like BOI

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Georgia.

less Pyrrha.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Oh yea I know that's so obnoixous

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

More Weiss.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

but im not a meanie poo

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

You don't have to cater to everyone, you don't have to be nice to everyone.

Weiss isn't mean.

But she has her priorities straight and goals to achieve, and she isn't going to be stopped in achieving them because someone else needs something for them.

Don't be taken advantage of.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

but ethan really wants this cause he hasnt stopped asking

and justin needs my help cause hes idk incompetant in sewing

do we have a /overwhelmed react cause we need it

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Georgia, Ethan will *never* stop asking. He wants to be insta famous. He also wants things his way, no matter how it works.

You have to stop the buck at you, not him.

I don't know Justin as well, but rather than make it for him, teach him?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Did you tell him about your mom's hand? And the errands

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Time is the most valuable thing we have. Don't let people take it from you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

:c

someones gotta be my no person

i need a manager so said manager can just tell people no

hal is good at it but hes not always around

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

As you wish.

damn, getting in a princess bride quote. üëå

I'm now going to be late for the doctor.

but yeah, I got you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

"all request to see Georgia must be submitted one week in advance to the manager for approval"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

oop hal is calling me out now

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

,yyeeettt

If people care about your sanity they Gon call you out

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ye

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

I'm not calling you out

I saw Ethan's story and I'm upset with him

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

he's not a *bad* guy, but he's certainly pushy

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Yeah I know he isn't a _bad_ guy but like she said no learn to take a hint

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

yeah for sure

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

srsy, no aint a hint no is NO bro

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

#nomeansno

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Also bae I can be your no manager 
If it's people I know I'll just be like

Hi I is concerned boyfriend and bae needs break pls stop

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

If you weren't 100% committed to doing that with Ethan that story is passive aggressive guilt tripping/entrapment.

Which is really low.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

*georgia defense squad assemble*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Just before she messaged here I got a message from her saying 
"He just texted me asking "hey wasn't this your day off" what did you do"

I was like shit she caught me

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Couldn't Casey come over and grab your yang and just borrow it, and return it later

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

If you need to in the future you can always say you're over with me or Tom and Jess (theoretically possible to see one without the other but not actually). We're close enough it's a day trip but far enough you can't stop on the way back kinda thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

You have my full permission to say you are with me when you aren't so that you can stay home and chill üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

you say your room as if you aren't also staying in my room

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

up until Jackie grabs that limelight.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Jackie will get her ass kicked out of my room if she does stupid shit

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

but then she'll end up in the room Georgia is paying for.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

except maybe not cause I don't like confrontation

yeah but she'll still have to pay me for my room

which means she has to pay more

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

*DABS*

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

But I'm in the room Georgia's paying for.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

sorry billiam somebody has to take an L here

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

Also <@!245270932602486784> said: "Wait I know what I need." and then disappeared and it has me concerned.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

We're knocking down a wall I allready told you guis

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

and I think you are probably most capable of doing it considering she doesn't know you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

LMFAO I didn't even realize that

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

so she won't bother you

but also we won't abandon you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

We just need to play musical beds

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

except for where you sleep maybe

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

~~I thought I was taking the loss when Georgia disappears to your room and you guys get to hangout all night.~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

see you can hang with us as late as you want

cause our room is full of late nighter

excluding georgia

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

(i am not usually a late nighter at cons believe it or not)

but ill sleep through any partying

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

well then you can hang till we sleep which is pretty much the same

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

*note too self pick up more under eye makeup before katsu*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

I CANT FIND IT but meg did a boudoir shoot with her yang friend and they have a pic of them sexy posing and her boyfriend as Jaune in the doorway screaming

That's what I gotta do as Pyrrha

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

YES

i've seen that photo and its hilarious

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

OMG I NEED IT

that sounds halarious

(I felt the need to clarify that it was because it was funny and not because it was a boudoir shoot)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

its HALarious

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

~~suuuure it is~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

we believe  you dont worry

hey look billys gotta put all those tips he used in the panel at colossal to good use

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

What did the panel even say I was just talking to ethan about boudoir

He wants to have a weapons model join the business besides me but she's a boudoir model that also cosplays

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

~~he doesn't need a model to hold the prop weapons~~

but.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

lmao, it was like: they need to feel comfortable, probably will do your make up for you before hand

soft lighting, take pictures for flattering angles with flattering clothing for thier wieght

thats pm what i remember

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

i remember: offer your model a drink

also if you are a male shooting a female ask a female friend along so she doesn't feel creeped out

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Don't eat salt for like a week before a shoot, it'll make you bloaty or something. Bring someone one with you for comfort. It's a woman's world, particularly on the photographer side. Any male photographer who is doing a boudoir shoot is a fool if they don't bring a friend along as a witness that nothing sketchy happened.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

thats right

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

I don't remember the model tips very well.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

so what time we scheduling the Martial Arcs shoot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

i could steel more tshirt transfers from work

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

_i can help you rip off RT_

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

it's payback for what they did to Weiss.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Real talk tho pj JNPR would be adorbz

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Yessss

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

yes well. PJs are much adorbz. If there is to be anything on the boudoir side I want to know in advance, and the request clearly stated.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

actual cosplay question for <@!245270932602486784> when you take your measurement for a pattern do u wear your bra or nah?

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

cause I am apparently new shy boi since Tom went all Rensexual.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Ye the same one I'll wear with the cosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

cool thank

and you go ovewr the boobz right not under?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

(I would think so)

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*



it'll be fun when Tom meets Gen.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

TMI but going right across the nip is the best measurement

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ok das what i dids

ok so according to this pattern i should mnake jacket in like a 16 or 18 but i wear like size 4 dress so wtf XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

I usually end up being a 12 and I can be a 2-4 in sizes

So that's not entirely inaccurate I don't think lol

Is it a "Misses" size?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Ye sounds about right then

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ok, i have a large back so i dont want to make it tooo small

im gonna attempt to cut pattern peices today

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Ye BOI

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

1 hour later: Georgia appears at the house with sewing machine and materials.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

no georgia has to stay home today

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

* Georgia has to do what Georgia wants to do.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ok truuuu but she need a relax day

plus i technically have done this part 3-4 times

that was like 7 yrs ago with asisitance but hopefully i can handle it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

I would offer my services but I'm gonna be like those weird musicians that lock themselves in a room and work

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

you'd be like: here let me show you what you have to do-- and its done!

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Hey, I never said Jess wouldn't do it on her own.

Georgia has said before it's boring to work alone on stuff. (though maybe that was just the Yang arm?)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

haha yea i wanna at least try myself

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

no, do it yourself.

https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/12344681/android/sticker.png;compress=true

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

i should have let my grandma teach me more XD she help me adapt paterns into the clothes i designed for the fashion shows i could use dem skillz now

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

and now shes suddenly grumpy so guess thats off the table

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

oh no they smoothed that over

like yesterday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Yeah cosplay work alone is boring but I've been hella productive working alone

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

yea im the same way with other creative type work

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Like I'll blink and it's been 4 hours and the cosplay is done lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ye when i did my lilith cosplay i was like that, i mean i didnt sew anything for litlith but i was alot of drawing and coloring lol

oh shi

so the pattern i bought only goes to 14

i mean im gonna be wearing it open any way soooo

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

nah, make it the right size.

I had a friend in college who made Kirito's heavy winter coat.

He wore it casually all the time.

it helps he was asian, but a bomber jacket with a heart on it is totally passible to wear casually.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

i mean its only one size off and technically its only da bewbs that are a 16

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Why my followers keep wanting me to cosplay Nora is Pyrrha not enough

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

well, at least it's not more requests for Weiss.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

coaplay all teh rwbys

shit i need and iron

an*

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

*the iron is also a gun*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

(billy wants to be let know if we actually wanted to do a boudoir shoot so he can mentally prepare himself and drink 4 shots before hand)

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

boy, you're late on that snark.

it's about the reaction time.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

Yeah I know whoop

Was busy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

babe imma order an iron ok?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

Oh by all means, we need one anyways

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

cuz im suppsed to iron this shit first

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

*you don't HAVE to

It makes for cleaner and easier sewing but

Ehhhh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

hmmmmmm tempting

also good thing the cosplay room allready has a built in ironing board

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

real ~~men~~ cosplayers don't use irons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

i think i could make this dress work for formal nora https://www.amazon.com/ToBeInStyle-Womens-Summer-Tube-Dress/dp/B0072LC8IW/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1515006990&sr=8-5&keywords=white+strapless+dress

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

Idk what the skirt length limit is for the formal

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

yea it sucks cuz the white one is the only short one

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

wouldn't they all be the same length...?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

eh amazon is weird

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

it's the same item, color selection shouldn't change that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

The coral color is pretty good

I know it has to be past the knee tho

That's the rule of thumb at least

Me: hasn't needed to worry about that cause Pyrrha wears a long dress

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

bae I need a new jaune dress I think

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Proooobably yeah so it's longer and they won't give you shit for it

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Also you: gotta keep the bf from looking too slutty. üòõ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

yo I will show up in my form fitting dress

idk what they're actually called

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

a form fitting dress?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

jaunes dress is kinda like nora dress actually lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

i know but if we're talking slutty

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

In one of the fics I read Nora bought that dress then gave it to Jaune when he went for Pyrrha.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

good friend tm

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

God knows I can't remember which fic it was.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

isn't it the same as Noras dress except color wise?

Jaunes dress I mean

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Basically

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

good for her.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

Is there enough room in that hallway? Usually pajama parties are in the lobby and they‚Äôre real serious about keeping doorways free in that hallway. Unless I‚Äôm thinking of a different hallway oops

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

the grand ballroom where the homestuck draw parties were?

theres enough room

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

Ye there's always room there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

I know mak was thinking wednesday earliest

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

could you check the roundtrip price for leaving tuesday 
tbh I don't think I wanna fly the day after con

plus tuesdays are usually cheaper

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

i mean i was just checking approximations

its probably around the same

its certainly pretty cheap now



UWU WHOS THIS

That dress Jaune posted that he's going again this year

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

thats a mawisa!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

Oh shit I guess I met marisa at Katsu formal last year

As Ozpin

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

oh shit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-04*

Oh shit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

im cutting this pattern and shitting myself cuz im afraid imma fuck it up

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-04*

Everytime Megatokyo posts a new comic I'm like, oh Fred still draws? i didnt know.

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

he's quite active these days.

I had been around the chat pretty often actually. Midsummer time.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-04*

still the same people hanging there or has it switched up?

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

not really.

Yama and Sonic play games and comment as they do. Dlove is still a hardware nerd. He got a job at NASA awhile back I believe though. Lul is still a dick. Mela and Olb are newer, Mela is pretty chill and Olb is decidedly not.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-04*

really? I remember Yama being a dick

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

he's kinda a dick.

less obnoxiously so.

He grew up.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-04*

üëè

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

klange is 100% in japan now, and also now a girl.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

<@!245270932602486784>  why does this pattern say stretch on it? üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

oh, Farfar is still around. Farfar is great. Same with paarfi.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

It can be used for stretch fabric

Which means you don't wanna cut ON the line you want a teeny bit of space

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

and then fred. The_Shadow eventually left, because everyone in the channel would attack him for posting political stuff that isn't left leaning. Pretty much the time the chat was straight up flamey.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

ooo like all the way around?

my fabris is slightly stretch but only one direction

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

Ya you'd rather it too big than too small

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

ye boi

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-04*

so no idea how it will turn out but... it has begun

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*



snrk.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

***wat***
Past hal
How did I horribly embarrass myself as Pyrrha last Katsucon and then forget about meeting an ozpin cosplay there must be some reason that memory has been destroyed from my mind

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

idk about horribly embarassing your self

but i think I might have a pic with you

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

‚ùó ‚ùì really??? it might've been another pyrrha or maybe my memory is just horribly awful that is a strong possibility

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

nope nevermind you didn't join us for the post dance pic

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> memory isn't too horribly awful

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

we grabbed a bunch and did a group rwby pic after the dance

but I definitely saw you and that jaune during the dance

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

i left after the yuris skating dance thing, i forget why. I think there was a panel with angry disney princesses and a lot of alchohol.  i ran into someone from university who I didn't recognize at first and they weren't even in cosplay haha oops awkward.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

the yuri skating dance thing was great

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-04*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Why do you want this Georgia.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

maybe she likes seeing you in pain :p

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Everyone says Georgia is really nice, too nice even.

Little did they know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

THIS IS BAD IM NOT SUPPOSED TO CHANGE PLANS LAST MINUTE

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

_bae that's not helping_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

also hal what did you do for thursday of katsu? parking panda wont let me book then

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

oh right, should I be involved in the genderbent shoot's chatting?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

oh ye

we havent really chatted

just said hi really

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

I have ended up conversing with sakurasan on multiple occasions and we're apparently going to play MTG at katsu

also bae I just put in the times for the search and bought it

here bae hop on a vid call and screen share so I can help you do it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

im watching a livestream

also the only thing i found was 99 for the weekend

thurs-sun

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

sounds about right, fiddle with the check in and leaving times a bit and you can lower it

I park at 3 and leave at 6

which got me 91

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

yeah i got it down to 91

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

so then you got everything down no problemo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

kewl

i think ill do 6 pm thursday to 6 pm sunday

cause badge pick up thursday doesnt start til 7

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

i did 3 Pm so i definitely have a place to park without worrying plus time to check in

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

true

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

tbh me arriving at 3 is like never gonna happen now that I think about it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

yeaaaah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

wonder what time well get tehre

after hal i suppose lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Well as for that, I'm not going to take thursday off.

So half day seems best.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

yuuuup

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I'll be at home, not NYC though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

im proabbly take half day or  the whole day

but again i dont want tom to be tired drving so hell prob take full day atleast

how long is drive agin <@!351785752197201920> ?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

im still gonna go to my morning classes

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

huh actually since I get done at college by 12:15 assuming I go to class

I could theoretically make it to the parking lot at 3:00

though I'm probably arrive around 4:00

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Yeah, I think it'd be best if we could do the trip before dinner time.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

yessss

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

Labinnak is hosting her cookie party by the gazebo and I just

how

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

w h y

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

the gazebo is always swapped at katsu

(Btw I'm talking about the magfest cookie party)

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Oooo have fun at the con friends üòÑ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

I kinda wanna go but also

its far

and cold

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

oh thank

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

apparently ghosting cons is much more common at katsu than magfest

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

well yeah

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

as in not paying for the con and going?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

Yeah im not sure if ill take a full or half yet, but ye we just gotta figure out parking situation tonight

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

yeah bill

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I'd believe it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

Magfest seems to side more on the event style con

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

it look to be about 5 hrs, we did vermont on a half day and got there at like what 7? 8?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

so like having a badge is more relevant,

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I keep saying, what's at Katsu that's not cosplay related. No one talks about it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

while katsu is like 
who cares about anything other than formal

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Prob not the best time to ask, but what other cons are occurring soon? Been meaning to go to more, but I always forget to do research and many are far and I'd be traveling alone most likely üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

tru

Zenkaikon is in may

uhhhh

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

What, Nick wouldn't go?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

small cons are spread throughout spring

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Nick has work and can't take leave too easily

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Oh wait, aren't you down at Rowan right now?

Kotori is this weekend.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

Appears

Magfest also today
Zenkaikon, Castle Point, they have those cherry blossom festivals that got turned into essentially cosplay events

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Yeah, I'll prob go to Sakura again

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

True, True, and Sakura is nice.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

And next is a definite

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

Philcon but that‚Äôs at the end of the year and sci-fi

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Yeah, Zenkai is really the start of con season.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

But like idk what other ones are conveniently occuring. I didn't go to CPAC last year cause it's been crowded af

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Katsu is the exception being in Feburary.

CPAC moved.

it's in a convention center now.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Oh tru

I did see something about that

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

as of this year. And it's not on the same weekend as Zenkai.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

Oh TAKII is coming up soon i think in philly it‚Äôs a karaoke con

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Oooo interesting

Yeah, I've been out of touch with the convention scene lately cause I got no con group anymore üò≠ really wanna meet you all tho. Rip

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

Arisia in Boston though that‚Äôs also sci-fi ish, Animore in Baltimore, setsucon in PA a lot of local peeps go to that. Those should all be between now and Katsu

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

Wow a whole con just for phil

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

so that's what happened to Phil.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

Das the oldest sci-fi con in the US he must be honored

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-05*

Lit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

If I leave now I‚Äôll arrive in NJ in exactly one hour

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

That would be halarious though,showing up to a fire emblem shoot as corn

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

Actually wait maybe 2 hours I have to get to the airport then it‚Äôs one hour to get home

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

i hope my boots come in time for katsu üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

continues staring at the screen figuring out how to disconnect

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

you are disconnected

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

OH

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I have Approximately 1,300 photos backlogged. ~900 from cosplay. My goal is at a minimum to do all of the remaining from ANYC and Next, leaving Otakon group shoots as the only cosplay backlog.



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

There's still ANYC stuff?

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Qrow Ruby, Qrow Tai, Hall photos.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Oops lol

Also are you ever gonna WANT to do the Ota group shoots?

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

You figured out the secret!

I mean, I just did too but.

Fire Emblem and Fate I don't give a damn about, I know a few people in the shoot but that's about it. (Sorry Marisa.) Just none of the personality that makes Rwby shoots so much fun.

As for the Rwby Friday and Saturday night, the prior is 234 images at group shoot quality which is just plain painful to work through, and the latter was the 'too dark to take really good photos so just use your phone' shoot.

Another strike against FE and Fate is I doubt anyone's still looking for photos from those shoots. I know the rwbyies will want to see them at least.

meanwhile, the Ota hall shots were pretty good so I should get to them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Then _fuck em_

Don't edit photos you don't wanna edit

*bill voice* you have to be careful that your hobby doesn't start to feel like a job

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

You learn quick.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

üòéüëâ

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

*I immediately pictured you finger gunning with sunglasses on. Exact image.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

_this was the intended idea so good_

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

As to it though, the primary time photography feels more like a job than I'd like is when all I'm doing shooting and not socializing. I'm not being hired for these things, I do them because I want to with my friends.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Cue that time we shot at animenext and talked so much it took two hours

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

That was particularly good.

Cause we also took the time in taking photos.

Like Kogara we socialized but never stopped to actually take photos. Part of that is because it went from our group to a big group, but.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Tru

That's why I was a big fan of hoodie NPR too

It was cool taking photos all relaxed and getting dinner

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Yeah, that was a fun day.

We're getting the hang of it.

Me: I wanna take photos
also Me: I don't want to take photos.

I'm insufferable.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

[insert why not both meme]

You know I love Sarah but I'm liking her Yang more than her new Weiss I think

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Oh yeah.

100%.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Her face is just friendly and vibrant and I don't know if it works for her Weiss

Like I feel like a dick saying it cause clearly she's hype about Weiss but her Yang is so much more fitting

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

She posted she was going to do Tamamo from Fate and that's a great fit for her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

/googles it

Oh yeah it looks like it

Like someone was like "why aren't you interested in cosplaying a lot of RWBY characters" and I was like idk I don't relate and can't pull them off

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Mm. I know people say 'it doesn't matter if you look like them, cosplay who you want' but it's a lot more fun when you do have that going for you.



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

Yeah agreed

I wouldn't personally wanna cosplay someone that I can't relate to

*Cosplays Adam*

I can explain

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Well that's just you having fun with it I think lol

There's meme-able characters like that

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

Lmao , plus I really liked that game but couldn't decide on someone to do

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

It doesn't matter to me on the photography side, my goal is just to make great photos of people. Something they'll smile looking at. I mean *I* wouldn't cosplay a character I didn't have the look for.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

Granted I can probably relate more to 9s

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

~~is that the twink you want hal to be~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

Noooo

Eve boi

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

OH ok

Ya like a couple people messaged me saying I should be Cinder and I was like..... _really_

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Like, sure, I could be druncle to everyone. I like being drunk. But I don't got that pretty look for Qrow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

//looks at Ryan

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Ryan is too pretty for Qrow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Yeah I have the same idea about Ethan too

Great Qrow attitude and even acts well as Ren

But he's a big buff dude

That's probably partially why Adam is more believable for him

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

mm. He's definitely too buff for Ren.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

:3c i tiny boi

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

The smolest Ren OMG ILL ACTUSLLY BE TALLER THAN YOU LIKE IN CANON

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

you *are* Ren you damn water flower boi.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

_watah flowah in ta gahden_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

dah gahden

why are you british boi!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Yo if only hal was smoller then we would all be canon

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

yeah I mean, jaune is pretty tall tho

not THAT tall

but still xD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Actually that's Jaunes canon height so I gotta get some stilts

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

like isnt Jaune taller then pyhrra in heels

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Yeaaaaah just barely I think he is

So I need some hella heels

But also it's cute putting my face in his boobs when we hug so

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

don't hurt yourself.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Yeah my current heels are good enough lol

I'm like 5'7-8" with them on

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

Im 5-6.5 but my ren shoes should make me taller

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

No stop that no more height is allowed

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

:3

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

https://unitymanipulator.deviantart.com/art/Rwby-Height-Chart-2-0-510528815

Ren is 5'8" here

And Pyrrha is 6'0" cries

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Junior is **6'9"**?

Holy fuck.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Weiss is 5'3"

Yang is 5'7"

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

They're all so smol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Penny is 5'5" that me

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

~~Penny is dead that you~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Weiss, Yang, and Pyrrha were the only ones I had a distinct urge to cosplay

But I'd consider penny

And maybe do Ruby once to finish team RWBY bingo

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

So borrow it from someone?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

That's the plan

Like people say I should be Nora (all the time omg) so I'll probably borrow Casey's to do it once lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

eh. Your high energy is more Yang like.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

That's what I thought

I sample traits from all the people I cosplay

~~ or at least I aspire to be that way~~

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*



This guy is dying Kamina, jeezus.

You don't want to help?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

I don't need to be smoller I'm canon height :p

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

lmao fucking kamina shirking his duty to die and shit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

I'm two inches too tall for NoraüòÇüòÇüòÇ wtf im usually too short

Actually 2b is 5'6" in heels so that's probably about right

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

ren is 5'9" rip

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

We're Closer in hieght renora

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

_i have messaged msginnyliz about getting pics with her Cinder, now I hope she thinks I'm cool_

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

when do they... not think your cool?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

That is my process of making friends bill

Step 1: send message

Step 2: sit back and think

Step 3: hope they think I'm cool

Step 4: friend acquired

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

you're missing a few stages of panic for that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Thinking includes panic

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

step 3.5: panic

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

YEAH

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

also step 2.5,... and 1.5

just panic between every step

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Yup yup

Ha bill remember when I was like oh boy I hope tom and Jess think I'm cool

üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Ha, <@!141729881779077121> <@!301927856240459777> remember when I was like 'hey, now that you met her, why does this super cool Georgia person want anything to do with me'?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Because friiiiendshiiiip

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

YEAH remember how I thought they were like 13

They're MY AGE

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

That was my guess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

They looked like 12

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

lmao

#realfoamhascurves

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/personal/2018/01/06/STRQ-mad.html It's a Hal. and Ryan.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Finally, both Emerlingcosplays in one place

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

truuu

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-06*

So many cool cosplayers üòç

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

It's mostly Ryan.

That fuck cannot take a bad picture.

it's amazing.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-06*

I need to meet everyone like damn

I also feel way noobish of a cosplayer nowadays compared to all you amazing peeps

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I mean, you are on the banner for CPAC.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-06*

True, still after 3 years üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*



**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-06*

Lol

But forreal. I need to start cosplaying more üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Got 3 potential ideas for the next one, but I'm an indecisive noob

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

Ryan is perfect for memeable pics too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Hey <@!184437198865563648>  do you have the emotional capacity to shoot Cinder v Weiss photos Thursday of Katsu ;3c

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Ye sure.

Of note, it'll probably be dark and I have no light equipment.

So unless there's a well lit area...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

WHEEZES GAZEBO

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Does it have it's own lighting?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

;3c

Yus

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Fuck yeah time to kill someone to get in the gazebo

Look bill _i shall bring you another friend_

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

*I don't want that kind of friend*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

_shes actually cool tho she doesn't spear people through the kidney_

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

You can never trust people not to do that these days.



for the record <@!141729881779077121> , I only took a picture of this dude because of you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

White knight, as told by Zenkai pics:



I ALMOST TYPED KNIGHT LIGHT I HATE MYSELF

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*



I don't know anyone named Hal, why do you ask?

!ban Halim

*Trips over hammer* U-ugu...

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*



*So uh... where YOU looking Yoko Taro?* <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978>

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

!kickban Halim

*Trips over hammer* U-ugu...

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

ITS NOT YOKO TARO ITS EMIL

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

It's funnier with that caption though.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

also to be fair knight light is close to white knight

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

BOOM.

ANYC done.

Also that cover image is the best shot I took all day.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

to bad I was still wearing my glasses in it

_and theres a later shot where its the same pose but I have them off curses_

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

they're both good.

I like the glasses one better.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

ye i agree the only downside is the glasses

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

* I like it with the glasses better.

It's a candid, may as well feel that way.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

tru

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

and I'm taking Georgia's advice. fuck the persona shoot.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

good

heed the georgia advice that originated from your advic

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

speaking of advice, fun anecdote about saying no:

I'm the type of person who hates taking a no for an answer.

Cause of the whole 'there's a will there's a way and I'm William' life philosophy.

huh. cool.



See the pier on the shore side?

I actually walked along that the day after I took these photos.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

That looks neeto

What... Glasses picture I didn't see any

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-06*

Rip persona üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*



This is me and hal in a nutshell tho

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

dibs on posting it first

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Omg no don't expose Instagram famous Wezrez Cosplay as a whiny diaper baby

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Dizzy, you better get the hammer ready...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

No offense or anything, but I wonder how frequently labinnak washes her RWBY wig

I feel like I always see it in the same position

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

probably don't want to know.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

wh
h-how often are you supposed to wash a wig
i only wash mine after like 3 uses to keep it easy to brush or if it's been in storage a long time oh golly oh no
but like I only wear some like once every 3 years help

also rather than wash i throw it in a mix of shampoo and fabric softener for 3 days and then pelt it with talcum powder ;A;

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*



The Fate cosplayers are slowly moving over...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Nah I wash mine like once every three wears unless I've been rolling around outside

U right Marisa

But idk if labinnak has ever washed hers

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

judging by the number of livestreams she does from raves and parties, I'd be hard pressed to believe she hasn't had to wash something vile out of it at least once.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

ok phew panic is over i don't have to fly back and wash my wigs

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

oh right, Marisa. I know someone over in Japan who frequents MOGRA.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

time 2 party

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

They're... an oddball. But if you're ever like "I need someone whose lived in Japan for awhile whose american" I can put you in touch.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

moshi moshi biru no tomodachi desu ka

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Kevin Lange's the name. I... think. I think he's now intending to be a trap.

like, that's the life goal.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

i was with my friend rose yesterday and somehow managed to start a 5-foreigner conversation in the middle of a tiny store about urusei yatsura cels

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Weird, but nice enough.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

does he cosplay. he should go to the international cosplay meetups

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

He goes to comiket I think.

I mean, I've never met him in person. IRC friend.

I've know him for close to a decade though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

rose and i are going to comiket yay i brought my zelda cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

and you wonder why TSA stopped you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

is zelda danger

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I dunno, but she was sobbing and sad in one of Link's memories and I was like 'well shit. Now I want to rescue her. Bring on the giant death machines I have no idea how to kill.'

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

go rescue her go go

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*



Sharp inhale

_siiiiisterrrrr_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

go live to tell your friends
survive

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Oh for ice skating, not Katsu.

yaaas.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

do i open a window to see what it's like outside or no because cold

if anyone want a tour i can attempt that but discord doesn't have video i don't think so maybe not

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

it does.

has to be in a PM though.

or group PM.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

aurii II PM boogaloo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

I haven't washed a wig yet but I haven't worn one more then 3 times yett

Adam one was close but I'm getting a new one anywayd

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

I have not washed a wig and I probably should at some point

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-06*

Washing wigs can be beneficial, just be careful not to destroy it haha

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

That's why I haven't washed them

I'm terrified

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Bae I gotchu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Yea I'mma need some direction on. That at some point too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Group wig wash yay

Does anyone need to dye fabric at our workshop day

Cause I just bought a dye pot

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

What's happening with that?

Like, all of BNE is showing up?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

I do not need to dye fabric

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Nah I invited everyone but I think peeps were busy

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Pretty sure Monica said she'd come when she couldn't go to NYE.

I mean, no complaints here if it's just the five of us.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

I threw it out in the chat

I think only 2-3 people will bite tho

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

well, you'll find out that way.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

tfw no bite emoji

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Watch as Erik says he's coming and Rebecca's like oh look my surgery has fully recovered I am also attending

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Are ice skating and workshop merging into one big sequential thing?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Yus people are welcome to sleep over

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

I may or may not be able to do Ice Skating, but I'll be free in the evening.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Hella

You could prob make it for chilis then

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

maybeh.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

can we do something other than chilis this time :c

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

it's part of the event.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

hi welcome to chilis

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Apparently all 44 people going are going to group up in a chilis after leaving the rink.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Yeah it's part of the event sorry bae

Huzzah

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

D:

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Also I was worried hoodie NPR wouldn't get good hits cause it's just hoodies not the whole cosplay but



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

it looks very beatles-esque

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

that was the idea.

I forget whose it was.

Georgia or Ethan.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Probably the ~~picture ho~~ Wezrez Cosplay

WHY DOES PHONE AUTOCORRECT OMG it auto capitalizes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

you're a famous household name

next software update will also add a ‚Ñ¢ after Wezrez Cosplay‚Ñ¢

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Oh gosh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*



Am I doing this right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

ooo fancy. is that cardboard/stock, foam, or worbla?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

Eva foam

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

oo nice

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

But all the texture is on the bottom o.o

Idk how to deal with that besides recutting them to be reversed

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-07*

Ooooo what are you making?

(yes, I'm behind on a lot lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

u gonna want to prime it before you paint it anyway so it should be ok, otherwise the paint will just sink into the foam

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

Storm flower, rens pistols

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-07*

Ohhhhhh

Lit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

Okay although it is the metal texture

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

NYOOMS THE FUCK IN do u has dremel

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

you could probably paint the foam without priming but it'll take a lot more coats and would probably look nicer with the priming. just a single coat of modge podge would work

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Yes we stole my parents Dremel

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

You can dremel the texture off

Probably should prime it first

I'd recommend gesso cause it's cheap

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

Before dremeling? I actually got a really nice spray primer

But I have modge podge too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

o ye gesso comes in big
don't keep it for like more than 5 years though it gets super nasty

might need 2 or 3 coats for foam though if it's gesso? i can't remember maybe not

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

What spray primer?

Plastidip?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

O be careful with some spray paints sometimes they eat foam

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

oh shit true

ill test it on the foam first

its Shellac

its alcohol based so it should be okay

but i also have modge podge if need be

i might... need a heat gun for the fine details

AMAZON

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Out of context this looks so odd



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

MOTTO MAE E SUSUMOU AKIRAMENAI KOKORO

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

Dah heels dear god

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Niceeeee

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

There's so much to comment on.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

MAYBE WHEN I TURN 18 OMFG

But they asked her to begin with oops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

The cops are on the way

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-07*

Also how is she not 18 yet

She looks it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Lolol alot of girls do

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Did I say comment on? I meant so much wrong with.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Still lookin at Sarah's Weiss

Still not likin it

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Good things to wake up in the morning and do.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

~~bein judgey~~

Really tho I'm gonna get some good V4 progress

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Today?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Yeeee

It'll start actually looking like a dress today

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Trying to do everything before the workshop are we?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Not eeeeverything

Just decent progress

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*



vaguely relevant.

https://lifehacker.com/this-bot-auto-likes-your-friends-instagram-posts-1821848732

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Omg lmao

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

Perfect

It's so hard to get first like on Georgia's posts :p

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

but who really liked the post then; you or the bot?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

Me cause as far as instagram I love all her posts

And on my phone the insta notification usually comes a few minutes after the post actually happens

So even if I like it as soon as I know I usually end up being at least 6/7 behind

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

but if the like is automated, does it show the same love and affection as waiting and watching for the post itself?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-07*

The app notifies me when it autolikes so I can look at the post

I mean I'm not gonna get it either way but it would be handy

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

I finished the Toronto photos yesterday but I really don't want to go through and rate them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

_then fuck it_

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

I mean, I *want* to do that. I rate then post, the edits are done. 3 star and above get posted.

It's like 305 photos and I'm terrible at self judging my work though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

im listening to disney while i work

i accidentally clicked on french "ill make a man out of you"

didnt notice til halfway through

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Theory: if you posted a bad picture to Instagram would it still receive likes?

You being Georgia. Cause actually followers.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

what constitutes a bad picture lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Clearly **I** would know nothing about bad photos.

üòõ

interesting morning. Someone shared one of my flower photos on facebook.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Oooh cooool

I'm waiting for water to boil cries

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

I'm guessing for the dye pot, not tea.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Lmao yeah

The dye isn't coming out the right color tho and it's frustrating

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

if it's any consolation, I've printed a dozen copies of a photo trying to get it to print properly.

So nothing is going well today.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Yeah luckily I have a lot of blue to fuck with the color

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Bless. I just gave up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*



Yeah I'm like pretty close to giving up but eh

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Do you need all 5 to make a Weiss color?

Or are you trying each one?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-07*

Royal blue was supposed to be for the dress but the color clearly doesn't match the color on the bottle

So im adding blues to tweak it to actually be that color

Weiss has like a gray blue it's dumb

I think I got it tho



Wait here's a better comparison

The flash makes it more obvious



Hello I'm georgia and I'm a perfectionist with the shade of blue gradient in my cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

you're among company when it comes to perfectionism.

if that's a word.

Tom with Adam's wig was terrible, and it's why I gave up on the santa Port thing for Konkon.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-07*

O I thought you were literally making Afina

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-08*

Lmao wouldn't be surprised

<@288513265661902858> this is my friend that cosplayed Janna at magfest,some good shit

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-08*

Janna cosplay? üòÆ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-08*

Her and her boyfriend will be at next but they are kinda antisocial o.O

But nice

**Bill** - *2018-01-08*

If Tom sees her...

she'll say 'no' and turn around it.

it's hilarious.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-08*

No I say hi every convention, she was at NYC but that con was fking packed

**Bill** - *2018-01-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

wow making a pack list for katsucon has been hell

https://68.media.tumblr.com/fdd609e1518d4c1e2cf72594d0f1f776/tumblr_or0235n9uV1sj9j7do1_1280.png

good or bad pj pyrrha inspiration?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Oh yea, packing list I started that the other day. I feel like that's probably more like gym Pyrrha but then again who doesn't wear gym clothes to bed

Not the same clothes you worked out in tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

o ya i wear soccer shorts to bed all the time in summer

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Ye me too üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

but like i cant think of anything else

like pyrrha has no motifs

at least nora has the lightning and the hearts

and jaune has pumpkin petes

and ren has flowers?

pyrrha aint got SHIT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Pyrrha has her symbol tho right?

I'm making Tom a T-shirt with rens watah flowa on it maybe you could do her spear thingy?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

watah flowah in the gahden

true i have her RT shirt

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Yea I'd just wear that and some cute shorts or flannel pants

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

<@!288513265661902858> is pajama jaune the pumpkin petes hoodie and ~~boxers~~ shorts?

i DO have red and green flannel pj pants....

I found this idea too>

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3d/94/59/3d945954ac12cf30df38f7ec1e0b55e9.jpg

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Im making my own boop shirt cuz I don't wanna pay RT üòÇ I'm gonna try to make her lighting bolt shorts too and then I have pink black and white plaid pants I'll use if I'm too cold

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-08*

Probably?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

What's her shirt say?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Oooo! Cute

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Yo me too tho

I get so nervous I'm gonna forget something

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

i have nightmares where i forget major cosplay components

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-08*

Omg me too

Or I have nightmares that Tom brought cosplay from A and I brought B and we won't match

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

OMG NO THATS TOO REAL



I feel like the shirt puts too much red in the picture

Also instead of ladybug slippers imma try finding some bunny ones

Oh no I found like 3 more pairs of slipper s



I kinda like the bears the most

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-08*

üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

bears have nothing to do with pyrrha but they kawaii

I was gonna go with short hair fem Jaune but after messing around with wigs I'm leaning towards long



**Bill** - *2018-01-08*

Long is better.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

Short I think I look a little too much like a shota and I'm not havin that

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-08*

Long is better

**Bill** - *2018-01-08*

Mhmm. Shorts kinda butch too.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-08*

i was gonna say "how about joan of arc style" but when I looked up pictures of her they all have different hair lengths <:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

go with anime joan of arc do long

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

protip: don't go to denny's when you're on your way home from katsucon we waited like literally an hour and a half or something for our food and it wasn't even busy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-08*

a.................. lucky charm......................

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

At katsu..

We need to do a quick towel Ren shot sitting next to Jaune in the hotel

Cuz that would be halarious

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

JESS SAID YOU WOULDNT DO IT

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

Not for any length of time

For for the meme

Anything is possible

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

its a pink towel specifically

i do in fact own a pink towel

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

ILL DO IT FOR THE VINE

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

I ain't gonna do it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-09*

vine is dead and so are our dreams

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

BODIED BY JAUNE

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

Vine is actually coming back for 2018

and nah I'll do it 
but you said do it for the vine

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

HAL NO

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

so I had to finish the meme

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-09*

2018 is lookin' a little better

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

O ok fair

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

That saves me from having to buy one

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-09*

isn't katsu over valentines day
why are y'all packing so early

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

i got so much to pack

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

What if we were going to Pyrrha shoot before Katsu?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

did you want to?

_would the weather let me_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-09*

if you do you could post the lyrics to "cold" underneath the images

i know that's more a jaune song but shh h

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

So my train of thought:
> I mean no, with this freezing cold I'mma not about to go outside.
> But, I'm always willing to shoot whenever you want to, all you have to do is ask. Not like we're that far apart.
> Like I haven't forgotten the Weiss trailer idea, I've been asking around to find locations that could work for it. Haven't found any churches but know some castley spots.
> *remembers someone shot in Central Park at a castle there*
> But it's too col....
> It'll look like the second White trailer. 
> shit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*



They only follow like 25 peeps I'm floored

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

why wouldnt they follow someone with a lot of followers who cosplays *every rwby character in existence*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

FALSE

Though I have my suspicions that it's Sakura SAN who owns that account

Not gonna lie

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

She does like running contests.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Ethan just offered an all expenses paid convention weekend in return for helping run their business booth

Golly gee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

shit gurrrll thats awesome

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

*where does Ethan get all this money*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

selling lewds on patreon

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

He makes almost 6 figs a year from being a forklift technician

It's a niche skill so I'm not too surprised

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

i mean he makes more than double me from his regular job so yeeet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

he made sure to tell us that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Yeah he tells everyone that üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

very humble.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Also Meg, the Pyrrha from konkon, she's the newest model for the company

Starting soon I think

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

we know who Meg is lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Which is good because she's a down to earth and friendly person

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

*he doesn't need models*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

IDK MAN I WAS MAKIN SURE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

so its you and meg? or does he have more?

eh, its age old "sex sells" mentality, put a women with your product itll sell better. its shitty marketing but its proven so

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

I still think he's far too interested in being cosfamous.

But that fits my personality too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

erybody wanna be cosfamous

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Yeah well meg and I aren't booty-booby people so

At least there's that

And Ethan's a bro so I like helping him in his entrepreneurship

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

"booty-booty"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Also Sakura San is hosting a contest and I joined it on a whim



There's a lot of good peeps in it wowee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Wow I'm almost out of Weiss pics

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

And you don't have much Pyrrha right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

I have like 7 Weiss

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

yeah I wasn't counting hoodie Pyrrha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

I don't wanna inundate my Insta with Yang and Pyrrha but I think that's what's gonna happen

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

well you proved awhile back Pyrrha was as popular as Weiss didn't you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Yuuuuup

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

so it's fine.

and also it's so cold to go shoot outside somewhere.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Yeah that's true

And Volume 4 Weiss is chugging along



**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

it kinda does.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

_ignore the scandalous midriff_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-09*

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

a scandalous midriff?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

Yeah man tummy photos are for patreon didn't you know

**Bill** - *2018-01-09*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-09*

then your Yang cosplay must be 100% scandelous all the time

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

There was a Pyrrha at RTX that I was like omg

And I was Weiss and I was fast shuffling down the hallway to catch her but she walked away too fast

I FOUND HER



**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

ooOOOoo, Hoodie Pyrrha beat Double Dragons and tied with ANYC RWBY.



It's like high school all over again.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

because of that shit design? of because of hetalia XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Hetalia.

To comment on your instagram thing Georgia; looks like most of the photos you have left are from Ben and Ben shoots were all solo.

The solution is Katsu. What shoots have you planned already?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

I hate posting so many lonely photoooos

Uh

A lot

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

I'm assuming these are actually planned shoots too, rather than the ambigious whatever we've got planned.

So how many of those are groups?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Okay so Friday I'm shooting with my friend Claire for Pyrrha

And the guy that sakurasan recommended me to, for Pyrrha

(But those are both solo shots cries)

And then at some point I wanted to snag some photos with msginnyliz

And we wanted to do pajama JNPR at night it sounded like?

And that's Friday lol

Plus whatever you wanna do

Which btw if you wanted to set aside /official Bill Time‚Ñ¢ im game for that too

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

we'll do it sunday.

When I figure out just what I'm doing at Katsu.

Saturday is just Genderbent?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Saturday I have a Weiss and Ruby shoot with the Sakura-recommended photographer again

And then genderbent

And I assumed some form of cheesy prom photos in formal lol

But that's all I have scheduled

I WANT more Weiss pics so that'll go into the schedule

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

*that wasn't optional*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

The cheesy formal photos?

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

That does look a little short on group photos doesn't it.

the Weiss pictures.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Oh yeah lol

I GOTTA FIND LEANNA

SO WE CAN BREAK YOUR HEART TOGETHER

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

why you do these things.

And Gen is off sync with Winter, so *sisters, sisters* has to wait till Zenkai.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Yeahhhh

Honestly Leanna we can snag after the RWBY shoot probably

I'll check with her

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

wait till Sunday, that's when I'mma do some schedulin.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Oh well I checked what her line up is and Yang is Friday so

We can't break your heart

Greek fire tho

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

is that a thing? Do people ship- stupid question.

Might be worth asking Leanna. She might be willing to throw on Yang for a shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Sunday Cosplay Workshop Day do you mean, the cosplayers cry into fabric and Bill tries to figure out how to take pictures of everyone in everything

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-10*

Peopleshipeverythinggg

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

well. There's JNPR, PJ JNPR, Arkos, White knight. Possible Freezerburn. No *sisters, sisters*.

pretty much. SOMEONE wants more DYNAMIC photos. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

~~the cherry blossom boudoir shoot~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-10*

The most important shoot

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Oh Sunday we have a chat, ladybug, Adrien, and hawkmoth btw bill

We just need a Marinette I crie

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Hawkmoth? You mean Adrien's Dad?

How to be a secret villain. Not that.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Didn't sakurasan say she's marionette and offered to join

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

rip Marisa.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Not for Katsu nah

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

but ye, I knew sunday would be something ladybog.

Though I may revisit that shoot list...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Oh man Friday I won't have time for a bathroom break, much less a food break

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

You're eating.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

HAL THATS A THROWBACK TO LAST YEAR

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

looks like my on the go, con snack-packing habit will come in handy

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

It's a throwback to every con I see you at, you guys order dominos at Saikou and Otakon...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

üëâ üëâ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

*fills bag with granola bars*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

Bill you have to understand ordering domino's has a special significance at katsu

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

*Clearly*. It must be how you swept Georgia off her feet.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

~~he's saving it for the cherry blossom boudoir shoot~~

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

You're going to bring the cherry blossoms yourself aren't you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Who? Me? Nah never

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

For the bloody lot of you, if you decide you want boudoir on the spot I'mma have no idea what I'm doing so fair bloody warning.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-10*

I did consider buying a bag on amazon

oh hi British billy

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-10*

We didn't dance together and Georgia's got me realizing I need to be less subconsciously flirty

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Something about sakurasans usage of Instagram annoys me and I can't quite figure it out

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

lol wait.

I just realized Ryan would be at this cherry blossom thing.

I'm not sure if he'd be pissed he wasn't included from the start or not but I know he'd be on the bed like white on rice. XP

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Oh for sure lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

who will he be?

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

*it doesn't matter*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-10*

Lmao he'll be Ryan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

acceptable

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-10*

He'd smell the gay shit from a mile away and knock on the door

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

you typed "knock on" did you mean "break through"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Breaks through door, slides onto bed, every hair perfectly in place

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

ooooo!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-10*

O.O

maybe I should follow em

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Georgia is totally on point about Sakura-san's feed being annoying though.

so.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Oh true you have to follow to enter the contest

I REALIZED WHY SHE BOTHERS ME

I've had my Insta like a whole year and I'm at 2,600 and she's had it 6 months and is like 1,500

It's like when someone is younger than you but better than you at something

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

like you?

XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

snrk.

tis true.

She's too big on contest and promotions for me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Yeaaah the promos get annoying

I'm about to need a drinking game about her and her prints lol

YEEEEET



ALSO did labinnak just get a whole fucking gift basket on her story

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

probably?

That personality of hers is going to pretty appealing to alot of ~~people~~ lonely dudes on the internet.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Wow you called it like it is tbh lol

That's it tho

She has like a fake Ruby personality at cons

I've seen her out of con (RTX pool party, only got invited by creepy dude, but a lot of cool peeps were there)

she's friendly but much less peppy

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

when do I not?

I had half a mind to introduce myself at Otakon before I saw the fake personality. Instant turn off.

To me, anyway. Some people aren't going to care.

This is bullshit I'm calling hacks

**Dave** - *2018-01-10*

Should have gotten tattoos, would get all the upvotes

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Like half of that video series is irrelevant because cosplayers all know makeup and ~~hair~~ wigs and the mood is easy to set for a character.

But doing that shoot looked so cool...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-10*

Georgia: "You shouldn't be able to edit off the cosplay, edit on a new one, and the face be perfectly fine"

Hal: "that's some shade"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-11*

In the bags they come in

Straight wigs I usually braid

Curly ones I turn inside out and put them in the head part

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-11*

if they super styled you may need to restyle them later, or put them on a wig head and wrap the long part around the neck like a scarf

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-14*

Woah what happened to the cosplay weaponry thing

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*

Marisa and Georgia (and anyone else whose hired a photographer): do you find its the photographers role to guide the poses and tell the story or does it stay with the cosplayer?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

depends. the cosplayer should definitely have poses in mind (*whoops*), whereas the photographer usually prioritizes making those poses work and getting a good shot out of it. if it doesn't work, they can suggest a similar but different post that kind of conveys the same meaning but looks better on camera. it helps if the photographer is familiar with the series, or even just has a bank of generic poses. like once I ran out of ideas but I told the photog that the character was super girly so she gave me a tube of lipstick to pretend to put on and that worked well.

i guess it's kind of a 60/40 cosplayer/photog joint effort

different photogs also have different strengths and weaknesses though. once i tried a pose and a photog said i looked like an idiot ( <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> ) and tried something different, whereas nance was able to nail the picture with the exact same pose

continuing to ramble eyy
imo i think the photog should prioritize a good picture. i've had photogs who recommended a ton of poses and gave me a bunch of pictures back and none of them were good. even the area we were in was no good and the lighting is awful. those pictures are sealed away forever. most of the best shots i've taken are more casual or random poses though that just managed to fit good criteria

o that reminds me i found a picture from konkon on my camera i never posted. just one. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-15*

a photographer should always have a back up plan

for like generic poses that always look good on camera

and work for most cosplays

but majority of the duty lies in the cosplayer i think

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

ye^^ 100%

[rolls up 15 months late with starbucks and the only picture my frozen hands took at konkon]
https://i.imgur.com/oyTkvMd.jpg

u know how some photogs will do free shoots of characters from obscure series that they love
once the opposite happened where a photog friend refused to do a paid shoot i requested because of the character. they had a client before who cosplayed the same chara and the client was so rude and awful it ruined the character for them. sad.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-15*

V nicu

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*

hmmkay.

> provides lots of photos
> at least one has to be good üôè

Was thinking about that video and how the photographers put together a mood board and directed the story of the shoot. The mood and colors and location are pretty much tied to the character, so a lot of it it pre written, but that doesn't tell a story on it's own.

I'm more of a technical photographer, but...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

i feel like telling a story would be hard with doing photos at cons, private shoots though you could tell a story with the location and the surroundings and everything. essentially the story is already for you with cosplay photography as well unless you are doing something non canon

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*

well, there's a photo, and then there's a photo that shows the character well. I suppose that's where the story comes from...

I wish I got to take a photography course at Rowan before graduating.

Probably decent. 80 is expensive for 30 minutes afaik, but 15+ images is higher than normal.



That's a little more typical I'd say, you get a handful of photos back for similar prices.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-15*

I'm at the mall with my sisters before I go back to school and I'm like wow

That's some lashes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

*walking into shit* "sorry i cant see through my lashes"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-15*

Holy mother of eyelashes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-16*

the only stories through pictures i've really seen from anime cons are these gems

thicker and bigger eyeslashes to show your kawaii dominance

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-16*

its true though

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-16*

don't u love photographers who make really bad advertisements with unreadable text and weird formatting
i love it

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

<@!288513265661902858> and Ryan just hit 66 likes which is a record for me I believe and blows ANYC and Double Dragons out of the lead.

The people have spoken. Ryan is best girl.



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-16*

joy

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

He doesn't follow me. He's clearly ~~stalking you~~ your biggest fan.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

Screams

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

Hal and Ryan are at 92, continuing to set records.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

Apparently Instagram made a lot of changes for January

And some of them are big bullshit



Namely this one ^^^^^^



But also Sakura San tried to get a bunch of people to do this, which can decrease how much Instagram lets your posts get interaction ^^^^^^







There's most of the stupid stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

NICE thanks instagram

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

people will yell at them.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-16*

Is this business accounts only?

Cuz it matches Facebook's for business accounts

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

I went to see if I could find a developer blog detailing it, but no dice.

Facebook does play things close to the chest on the code side.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

<@!184437198865563648> Ryan's wearing male penny Friday and wanted to snap pics

And I'm like orz where's the time

Of Katsu I mean

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

plenty of time in the morning, or does he need his beauty sleep too. üòõ

We'll figure out something. Where there's a will there's a way, after all.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

true true

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

why does sakurasans rwby photoshoot cost monies?

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

LOL

So tell me Rebecca and Jamie aren't interested in truth bombs so they can be like ERIK YOU FUCK I HAVE A CRUSH.

Just try and tell me that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

>o>

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

Yes I just saw this poll now.

<@!245270932602486784> Does Gen's Winter coat seem rather... translucent to you?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

She might still need to put interfacing in it or whatever it's called

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

its probably a mock up

or interfacing ya

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-16*

Gens trying to show off so she can get new man's

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

i hope so, at least

G A S P not my SISTER

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-17*

Breaking up with Qrow really changed her

Also I saw truth bombs and thought the same thing

(Also it still looks like a fun game TBH)

But only with friends tho cause it'd be boring with people who don't know you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

What is it?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

Instagram is also doing a thing where if you don‚Äôt keep checking the app it will withhold notifications and likes from you until you check the app more

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Well, that makes some sense.

What are you going to do with 400 like notifications?

Flooding your phone would be bad.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

nono like if you check your app all the time it'll give you all those notes
if you upload a picture for the first time in weeks and then don't check on the app again shortly after posting it, it won't notify you of any likes at all

i dunno if they'll show up on the post

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

When you check the app it resets the "how many likes have you not read" count.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

yes.
and if you get too many notifications you can just turn them off
but they implemented a thing where, if you don't use the app at all, it will withold notifications from you. If you get 3 likes, they won't show up at all until you start checking the app more.

there was a news article with an interview about it somewhere

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

3 away from 100 likes on Hal.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

this cosplay store in japan is selling a rwby glinda cosplay for $30

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Hmm. David has Casey as a mutual friend. Wait for it, David is making a power play on all the insta famous rwbies by befriending all of them at once.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

Gasp evil genius

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-17*

That's not.a bad price at all

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-17*

Oh no, is this one of the people you danced with

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

probably

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-17*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

So Hal and Ryan have puttered out at 99.

Ironically, I think Ryan didn't like it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

He gotta get it to hundred

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

so like, not to snoop on other photogs, but what was the farm you went to with Ben? My guess is he either knows someone there or paid, judging by the trend I've seen.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

it was a farm in hillsborough

lemme see if i can google it

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

and therefore private property.

I'm going to talk to my neighbor whose a pro wedding photographer and see what he has to say. (I don't think he came to gingerbread this year ~~because Georgia would have sniffed him out from a mile away~~ since his wife is very sick.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

http://dukefarms.org/

they said it was ok

some guy stopped us to tell us commercial photography was prohibited and we were like "were just college kids doing this for fun" and he was like oh carry on

so

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

The old 'it's for a class' excuse.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

I MEAN its not commercial thats not a lie lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

well.

You are promoting a brand.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

i think to be considered commercial you have to be making money off of it though, like if you took a pic there and then sold prints

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

NO FINAL EXAM YEEEET

oh whoops wrong chat

w/e lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-17*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

seems like an easy A tho

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

if the other people writing your paper are up to snuff anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-17*

No laptops tho wtf

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

i understand in a math class no laptops

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-17*

Oh yeah you can't math on laptop ez but it's the modern era bruh

I type way fucking faster then I can hand write. I would've loved a laptop in schoolüëå

But most of my classes were in a computer lab anyways cuz design

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

ya typed notes look nicer

and you save money and paper

I SEE SOMEONE IN THE FRONT ROW TRANSFERRING OUT OF THE CLASS ON THEIR LAPTOP LOL

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*



I like how there's literally nothing in sparta/our area.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-17*

Rip

Like I said before tho there's lots of stuff in my area. Stuff that you might not find easily through basic searches too. So like what kind of photo spots are you looking for?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-17*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

2B

and no rush, sleep if u sleepy

i have a backless stick on bra but id like more lift

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-18*

If at all possible I would avoid doing it because it can be dangerous for a long time but I know ways to make it less danger if it‚Äôs for like open shirt binding and stuff
Oo gotcha I assumed it was for crossplaying

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

Define "tape boobs" like hold them in a particular spot?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-18*

Georgia 2 rescue 
Oyasumi

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

http://ultimatebraguide.com/assets/taping-up.jpg

like number 2 or 3 i guess

liek to make them pushed up but without a bra

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

It's basically all about putting enough tape down

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

shouls i use medical tape or just duct tape?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Medical tape would work if you put enough down

**Dave** - *2018-01-18*

Don't need tape, all you need is https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-ujUdrdpX7Ok5W

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Also would be healthier. Cause tape is pretty iffy to use to begin with

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

yea my chest can be sensitive

also thanks dave your so helpfull XD

so idk if i wanna put a bunch of duct tape on it

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

And awww I'm in the process of trying to do a 2B cosplay too haha

And yeahhhh it's risky

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

eyyyyyyy! those damn boobie and back windows are hard, i wore it with my stick on bra but there wasnt enough boobage

i was thinkning of useing the stick on bra and then making tape straps

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lmao I feel it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

oh opps

sorry am out of it today

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

should have left it oppa cause it's oppai.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

i think theres explicit boobie tape

i wouldnt recommend medical tape

but yeah you basically need like "open shirt binding tutorial" or something to that effect

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

bind would be squishing them downand minimizing them i wanna maximize

but ooo boobie tabe

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

ya youd wanna use whatever the shirt binders use

the same tape

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

ooooo ok i see what your saying

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Gonna make parts, not sure if whole thing yet <@351471675843411978>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lmao exactly why I'm debating just buying

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

well leannas a pro

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

The embroidery seems the most intimidating

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

and i have sewn 1 thing

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Leanna's something.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

_redheads yes_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

~~and hal can be his twink~~

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

I would so crossplay 9s tho. He's such a cutie

<@350852631327145986> didn't wanna cosplay 9s either tho lmao

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

The one on the left is Popola.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

So true

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

tom said he would do 9s but he just wanted to do adam more lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ohhhhhh lol. Nick didn't have like any desire to haha

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Wasn't he reusing Okabe again at Next?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Sort of. Yeah

At my request lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

well idk what nick looks like but tom is a 5'6 skinny small boi so would be a good 9s

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Nick's much taller, so he doesn't fit the part too welk

Well*

I just thought it'd be cute

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

in my 2b heels were like same height so perfect for 2b and 9s lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ayeeee nice. I'm pretty tall to begin with, so like with Nick's height it'd match up

I'm about 5'7

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Like Popola ain't also a tsundere.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

True haha. But A2 is more so imo

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Popola needs hugs okay, and I'm not hugging the random people at Katsu cosplaying the sisters.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lol oh geez

But like A2 needs them a lot too. Most characters like hate her, but she's super kind deep down

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

everyone needs hugs and therapy

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Yeahhhh

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

no you dont lmao xD

i will if they remake it

but it has so much grinding and traveling

slow paced version of Automata

also thong girl

~~girl~~ guy

I dont know much All I know is that Kaine is a guys soul in a girls body literally or something

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Oh god

I mean I'm kind of curious tho. And I love the style of gameplay

But I'm waiting for price reduction

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

yeah they have been talking about porting Replicant cuz the american version you play as the Father cuz they thought the brother pretty boy character wasn't cool enough for americans

https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wGoLd3Bjwp0/maxresdefault.jpg

Left american version, right JP version

so ofc I wanna play the right cuz he's hawt

But because of the success of Automata they have been talking about remastering replicant and bringing it to america

so hopefully ü§û

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ooooo rad. Yeah I've seen one of the nier games at GameStop before, but it's still $30 for the PS3 so I'm like nahhh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

Also the left one is the girl characters Father and the right is the Brother and they figured Americans wouldnt like that Incest-y feel

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

i feel it. But like you said, i bet they will remaster cause nier automata has been such a success

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

yeeeah

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

i really need to find more games similar to nier tho. Like i love hack n slash titles

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

yeah its hard to find good ones to be honest

the only other one I ever played that I finished was Ninja gaiden 2

super gorey

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Remember that time we sat and watched 40 minutes of nier playthrough Tom? And me and Jess basically feel asleep?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

of Nier Replicant yeeeep

I'd play it thou

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

We wouldn't.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

hmm lots of sites say to use medical take for the bobbies since its made to go on skin ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

I really hope your crazy boss looks over your shoulder looking into that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

na bra dude is loud af i hear him a mile away he jingles

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Yeah, you don't wanna use duct tape <@351471675843411978> 
Medical tape allows for your skin to breathe a bit more. 
Although in all honesty why don't you just buy a nice push up bra? Lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

back shows

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ohhhh gotcha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

i could try a halter thou

ill try halter tonight but im asuming the strap will prob show

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

I mean there's different hack type tricks to make the back strap not show

Such as using medical tape to make the strap attach lower

Might be more comfortable too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

2b back is so open id have to have it around my wasit XD

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Oh shit my bad haha. Didn't realize how low it was

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

ill try the halter, then tape wwith backless bra

yea i didnt either till i tried in ont eh first time and i was like "what bra do i even"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ohhhhh haha

Now it makes more sense üòÇ

There's gotta be reviews from people out there suggesting what to wear

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

i found the backless bra thing last time, i saw alot of people just wearing a regular bra and letting it show but im too picky for that

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

everyone on this server has mild ocd ye.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

I feel you. I'd be the same way

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

ye boi

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

_aggressively doesn't wanna see Sakura San be pyrrha_

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

is she going to be?

Boy, you don't like her at all do you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

She's taking votes for the last RWBY cosplay she should add this year

And IDK FAM I don't dislike her

I dislike her popularity-grabbing outlook to Instagram

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

yoo her posts are annoying af

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Out of all the people I know you know, this is the most dislike I've seen from you. So I think you kinda dislike her.

Her instagram is annoying as fuck though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

no offence but like i dont care about your rwby 30 day challenge lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

Because I don't tend to convey dislike openly *adjusts Anime glasses*

But this is just wowee

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

hmmm...

I dunno if that's it.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

but w/e.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

I mean she got like actively upset at ice skating when I left to skate with hal

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

none of us seem to like her much.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

And I was like Nani‚Ñ¢

Yeah

She feels very not genuine

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

you right.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-18*

~~she seems not genuine cause she isn't~~

I mean what

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

It's the same problem I have with labinnak

Who is otherwise very friendly and nice to me

Which btw she never answers comments but I saw she answered one and

I was like huh I wonder why



.......... oh

That's why

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

yup. that's how this works.

fake people interested in what you have not who you are.

or something.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

Daym look at dem titties

He least favorite hero is jaune better go kill her

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Wait so why does everyone dislike this girl lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

she fake. Current running theory is she's interested in Georgia for her follower count on instagram.

Other theories are she has a thing for Hal, a thing for Georgia, and a friend crush on Georgia. (Georgia's term, not mine.)

She's also really annoying in the way she maintains her instagram.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

She also wanted nothing to do with me it Billy until she saw talking to Georgia and then she was like "oh who are you?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ohhhhhh. Rip

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

which can partially be 'i'm instagram famous and can't talk to *everyone*' but can also be 'you aren't famous enough'.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

Then she got all freaked out when I said I followed her. Like dude you can't be all into getting more followers and then get freaked out when ppl you don't know follow you

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

everything aside, you guys going to enter the couple contest?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

I doubt <@351785752197201920>  even knows it exists

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-18*

Lol Georgia and I still need to do that

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Well I mean I knew you guys would do it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

Maybe if Tom's costume comes in time

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Aww sounds cute

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

could use christmas.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

christmas is totally acceptable

its a popularity contest, again, so

bumblebee and arkos and renora get big bolsters from that

Hal should i pack all of pyrrha or just the top half so we can take a kiss pic

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

*does renora boudoir shoot*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

lmao we enter as team jnpr

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

Lmao done we win it's over

Im betting it'll be bumblebee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

theres so many bumblebee entries

arkos tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

I only saw Ethan and Casey's entry

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

Ah I don't follow her

Because why would I

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

me either.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

I don't know any of these people üòÇüòÇüòÇ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

i did only so id remeber to vote for the friendos when she had the rwby contest

what did u win <@!245270932602486784> ??

<@!351785752197201920>  you wanna enter contest?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

oh

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

I actually don't have a cosplay account anymore, but have been considering making a new one

I used to have an account with a hometown friend of mine

Needless to say I've been wanting to get more involved with cosplay and cons, but I don't know many people who are into it. Except for you all, but I still gotta meet everyone C:

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

yes! well have to do a meetup soon

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Definitely haha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

hell yeah

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

I'm considering going to CPAC along with AnimeNEXT (which is a definite)

But may look into more cons

Also am debating whether to follow through and do an Ann Takamaki (panther) cosplay this year

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

Lmao I love how I asked you what your insta was like duh you followed me it's litterally right there

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lmao oh yeah, that's like my private one. Feel free to follow üòÇ

Just don't have a cosplay specific one rn

Although there's prob some miscellaneous cosplay shots in there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

doooone



UM WHAT THE POO

Sakura San wants to talk to that guy????

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

lulllsss

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lol

Just ignore???

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

ya i left the group

also can confirm that sakura san runs the cosplay.rwby account

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Rekt

I feel kind of bad tho. Like is there a reason this girl wants all this attention? Or is she like crazy?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

i dunno fam

wish i could figure it out myself

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lol like how did she even start talking to you all? Just at diff events?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

she just messaged me one day

back when she had like 500 followers i think lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Ohhhhh

Jealousy alert

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

MAYBE? idk fam

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

yo you so don't like her. üòõ

That's fine though lol.

and if not jealousy, she's trying to use you.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lol sounds it

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

Which is not cool, as we've discussed before in other contexts.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

^ definitely not cool

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

Yeah it's one of the two probably

But also



I'm apparently in her RWBY fam

interestinggggg

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Lol what even is that üòÇ

A cult?

A clique?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

i guessss?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

LOL

Like it just seems very cliquey. Like if someone wasn't in that fam, they ain't good enough

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

What's more is that most of the people in the fam have more followers than her

With the exception of, you guessed it, the male cosplayers

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

So weird

And kind of spooky

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

<:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

The life of a male cosplayer ain't easy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

imo you should def someday have more followers then me and if you dont i will be angry lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

just gotta get yourself out there more????

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

lewd patreon tom

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

lmao

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-18*

i think her rwby fam is just the people she does photos with and what cosplays they do

also the people she messages shit on instagram

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

probably, but it still seems pretty cliquey unless anyone can get on that list

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

guys i have an idea and too much time on my hands

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-18*

then again
I wonder why she takes photos with these people

ooo bae

I know one thing you can get along with sakurasan about

finding steelwolf odd and hard to deal with

mainly cause i gave her a kinda heads up on the fact that hes a creep and stalker since she put him as part of her "rwby fam"

so now we're talking about how bad he is

ah mutual distaste

it makes friends out of all of us

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

Thank for your support <@!351471675843411978> but why should I have more then you?

If you say "Cuz you cute" again üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

cuz you have like idea anime boy body

and most people who cosplay anime boys well are girls

so for accuarcy

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

For "research"

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

g i g a n t i c

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

Zomg 4 people! It's cuz they could tell it was heart felt

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

Omgggg

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

omg i've hidden behind that one column many times on sunday. it has an outlet to charge stuff which is nice to do before roadtripping home. :3c

jessu if u still need tape tips i can offer a tiny bit of advice (i mostly know about flattening for crossplay), like use KT tape or sports tape, something that is 100% meant for skin. put tissues or a piece of paper over any spot you don't want being torn off by the tape. it could help to lay down while applying the tape because otherwise gravity, but then it's hard to see what it looks like. 2b also has a chest window right? throw some contouring in there with makeup

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

Ooooo thanks! I'll have to look for the KT tape

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

also hmmm. people recommend putting lotion on beforehand but then that might make the tape soggy or slip off, so maybe do it an hour or so before or the night before? get h y d r a t e d. people often talk about pain and difficulty and breathing and absolutely not wearing the tape for more than 6 or 7 hours but that's for super squish flat instead of what you're going for so I don't think you'll have the same problems but take care of yourself anyway and don't wear the tape for tooooo long.

according to facebook on this day last year i was katsucronching



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

Holy fabric

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

i decided to make only 3 new costumes ; u ;

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

3?! Jeez woman

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

that's fabric for 2 of them though where'd i get the third. hmm.

wait no maybe it's there under the purple. the purple was just for button covers (screams)

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*



I started on a thing.



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

YAS

WOW that's actually a PERF vest

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

Ah! Yes that helps!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Gotta unzip it a lil to show them boobs

Pilot boy shows his chest

His boobs are out, you gotta do it too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

BILL IS PILOT BOI

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

sakura san isn't the one trying to steal instagram famous wezrez's affection

but tlt_wm photography is!!!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

GASP x2 COMBO

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

‚ù§

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Things I've learned already: I don't actually want the attention of cosplay. I kinda like my background role.

That said, I spent the money I might as well do the thing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Yeeeet

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Course I bought half of it in a size too big (a good thing I suppose) so I gotta play the Amazon return game tomorrow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

True

Or get sewing friends to maybe fix it

ALSO



Cries I did a good deed

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

You've got a transforming dress to finish.

Ha yeah that's true üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*



She actually did the thing.

Not sure she has a need but...

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

What did she do

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

She made a user account for her cosplay persona.

I've seen this done, but I dunno.

Probably bothers me cause it goes against me making friends. I'd be make friends with the cosplayer, not the human being.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Yeaaaah feels weird

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

not too close but just close enough

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

i was stuck in like the back row the first day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

<@!351785752197201920>  and i sat in the front alot cuz try hards i guess?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

was it math class

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

math, psych, graphics

sept graphics was only like fist semester then we moved to like mid classroom

so we could watch the weird girl paste 400 pictures of anime character to word docs and print them out everyday

like you have graphics software why are you using word docs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

omg

i love humanity

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*



I expect all of you to slap me upside the head if I ever think for a second doing wedding photography is a good idea.

people are *crazy*.

(Not you Jess, of course.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

>u>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

mmhmm suuuree

me when i got the wedding photos back "i wish she photoshoped all these back acne scars out"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

People kept stealing my projects in woodworking class and the computer graphics teacher backed me up that I wasn‚Äôt purposefully not doing them so eventually the teacher was like ‚Äúsit in the back and edit these pictures I have instead‚Äù
But I wanted to use the hose for dusting off sawdust ;u;

Every con should have a sawdust hose that would be wonderful

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

bill 50 million years from now when were marrying age, me and hal will do wedding cosplay so youll have to photograph :V

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

50 million years

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

That story is tragic Marisa

Why they do dat?

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

No.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

Jealous of my sanding skillz

You gotta biru

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

bill plz

you cant deny wedding arkos

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I was salty not being in the group picture as ice skating. Do you really think I want to be a camera at my friend's weddings?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

nah not wedding

cosplay photoshoot

coincidentally in wedding clothes

that will conveniently also be used for Actual Wedding Things‚Ñ¢

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

!hush

https://i.imgur.com/hXuK1cP.png

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

But dont worry Actual Wedding Things‚Ñ¢ you can chill and just take selfies with us cause wedding photography is hard

BILL PLZ this is a genius idea

_just think about it_

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Sakurasan wants ice skating photos.

haha.

I want ice skating photos too. But macbook is still busted.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

she asked you?

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

mm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

~~sorry that was mean~~

ill delete it to preserve your positive view of me

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I'm the embodiment of salt. you can be a little mean.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

Lolll

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

shush preserved positivity

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

people won't even notice.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

Too late

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

nah, I like salty Georgia.

see what I did there.

it's a call back.

Also: I bet you didn't inform her that I have no promises for a turnaround time when you told her I'd shoot genderbent JNPR.

Week after Katsu she's going to want photos and I'mma be like... "no."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

lol see thats the thing about free, you can't demand things lol

shes making people pay $14 a person for another photoshoot she can get content from hat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

also....... like.................... we do it for fun............................................. not followers.........................................................................haaaaaaa

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

14 a what?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

per person for some rwny photoshoot shes doing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

$14 dollars per person for some huge rwby shoot she has going on

its like one of each character

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

She /was/ behind that.

she's paying the photographer.

Those shoots are a pain. I can say that after Konkon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

thats like a 20 person private shoot

RIP

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

and the trend I've been seeing is charging so and so much extra per person.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

yea i just find the idea of "pay your way into this photoshoot" to be a lil weird

but maybe thats just me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

We did that for otakon it was like $12 a person. We voted on the photog though and ironically everyone wanted the more expensive option

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

yeahhhh if im paying for a shoot with people, im making it pre-arranged friends beforehand for the most part

like i did a team rwby shoot last year

it was all people i knew

dont like recruiting randos much for paid shoots

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

yea idk

like a small group with people you knew i could see but i wouldn't wanna pay for a shoot of like 25 people

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Correction: someone didn't tell Sakurasan I'm *shooting GB JNPR*.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

LOLLLLLL

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

~~or she didnt care til she found out we were friends~~

SORRY TOO EARLY FOR SALT

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

again, I like salty Georgia and you don't even hold a candle to His Snarkiness, The Exalted, Hailing from a Northern Province, Little High, Little Low...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

its just so frustrating

like who gives a poop about being instagram famous

i appreciate having a following

but what the heck cosplay isnt fun if you just focus on being popular and having all these fans

and it just _seems so much_ like thats what shes doing

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

And that's why we're friends.

You're a person, not a personality.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

thank

i try

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

you don't have to try to be Georgia tho. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

u right

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

did you tell her your the photographer?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

I told her

i told her once over insta

and once AT ice skating

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I told her too, cause wth.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

shes just like, oh yes, instagram famous with all my instagram famous friends

and it just grinds my gears g-damn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

oooo jeez way to pay attention

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

ikr

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

"oh sweet" She totally forgot.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

YEEP

üíî

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I should reply to her about wanting to have me shoot her thursday or sunday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

she wants you to?

i didnt even realize she had a thursday cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

She's doing BNHA with Jesse.

Shooting with her and Jesse don't sound so bad, I guess. But as you can see, thursday is going to be a gloriously fuzzy time for scheduling.

Sunday...

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

yeeeet

bill is best boi so i got first dibs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

OOOOOH

Lissy just messaged me asking if I wanted to be a Weiss in a team RWBY photoshoot for Saturday of Katsu

I want to, so RIP my schedule

Hopefully they're shooting at a time I'm already free

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Considering you're Weiss for what, 4 or 5 hours? 2 of which are the group shoot?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

I thought you were weiss on satday

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

She just said she is?

She's switching to Jaune at 3 though.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

I was wondering why rip schedule lol 
also I thought we were doing genderbent at the group shoot

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Not unless she mixed things up since last weekend.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Yeah no I'm not changing til 3

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

:c

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Also, how come Sakura comes looking for shoots but nice people like Lissy don't. Sad. Not that I've like, ever shot her. Missed her 90% of the time at Konkon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

You want me to recommend you lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Nah.

Drink.



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Whatthe fuck it's January

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

god bless lightroom. I lost nothing from when the computer's logic board blew up.

Even the edits I was doing as it blew.

That lewd Yang/boudoir cosplayer from colossal, Steamdumpling?

She shows up in my suggested friends.

Because of *sakurasan*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*



Remember when Bill said "pose with a fake smile" and everyone commented on the post saying they loved my smile

I think about that sometimes

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

Good times.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-20*

O.o

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-20*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-20*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*



THIS WAS THE PHOTO I WAS LOOKING FOR

it's like comical bloopers from boudoir

Tom is the unclaimed leg

Hal is Meghan

Jess is Ruby

I'm Jaune

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

_shrugs_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

Also I have a very distinct mental image every time we say cherry blossom boudoir and it makes me wish I could draw

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

I'm assuming this image is basically a squad meme so...

go find it.

~~it's not like any of this happening~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

Nah fam it's original georgia content

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

I still can't tell how far you guys want to go with this stuff.

Da twink

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

why do almost all conventions use blue in their dealers hall
is blue the convention color
why not, like, mix it up a little

do only blue tablerunners exist

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*



Look familiar?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

oh that's a male weiss i thought for a minute it was jack frost whoops

or is it a crossover
i feel like male weiss would have tidier hair, at least in early seasons

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-20*

Wow Tom is such a better Adam than that dude just saying

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

oh yeah, that was my immediate thought.

<@!301927856240459777> that's sun and neptune from Konkon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-20*

Lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
but are they cosplaying sun and neptune there? :0

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

nope.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-20*

Adam's tie doesn't even look like that

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*



I've seen her at two different cons and I'm still impressed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

_my wife_

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

Erza right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

Ye

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

there's one who goes to zenkaikon and otakon too but her wings are so big she can't move around much :0

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

isn't she the one you want to make armor for?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

Yuuuup

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

This might be her, it's an Otakon photo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-20*

17776 is a weird group

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

foobaw

it could be worse. it could be the lorax fandom

do you think people ever did a onceler boudoir shoot
this was before boudoir shoots were popular but maybe

hal and georgia should do a boyfriend of the dead cosplay



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*

Actually that last pic looks like Geoff's floor

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

; A ;

i've been trying to recruit a harvest moon cosplay group for years if anyone is interested
i did get several hundred people on tumblr saying they would do a harvest sprite group with all 101 harvest sprites but maybe it'd be easier just to get, like, the bachelorettes from a wonderful life and the main character or something

i did see a AWL bachelorette group at katsu once it was beautiful



omg also there was a harvest goddess last katsu!!!! she was awesome

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

Hello yes I am here that is Lulu

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-20*



The runner of the group shoot sakura is in doesn't look too well prepared, in my honest opinion

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

mmm yeah. it's a little late to be looking for people for a group shoot, though I suppose it's easier to find people because RWBY is a big fandom?



should be doing homework or laundry or something productive
poorly photoshops photos instead because i crave that cosplay and the closest cosplay event isn't for another 20ish days hnnng

anime is real never 4get

‚ÄúYou put that phone down and study magic *right now* or I swear I‚Äôm taking you back to the auction house‚Äù

Although I guess right now in the manga she‚Äôs kind of being rebellious? And Elias is out of his mind? Hmm.

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

manga got weird.

very weird.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

Manga got dark <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> just what every whimsical series needs

I wanna find that crossover chapter between Magus Bride and totsukuni no shoujo. I saw ads for it but never found scans online.

Not the Magus manga by nagabe the actual crossover

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-21*

I mean if download it off flicker I'm sure it would be better quality ye?

**Bill** - *2018-01-21*

The one I sent Ethan was full-size, this one is cropped to 1000 pixels.

You don't need to be bigger than 1000 pixels on the long edge for most web browsing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-21*

Ahhh

**Bill** - *2018-01-21*

Awesome to go to the space place though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

i find it so much easier to exercise in the summer rcuz like the result matter more.

but yea there are more reasons then just weight to work out

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

do they all not apply to me?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

im just sayin there are many benefits

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

eventually I'll guilt myself into using that membership.

Maybe when I lack a backlog.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

i was on those treadmills once that the TV only plays when you walk

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

tru thats why i bum off mine at home or school

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

You can stick it in the basement.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

id never pay for a gym membership

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

Have you done anything down there Jess?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I mean, could get that pool table fixed up.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

yeee ive had the plan in my head for a while, its just finding the time and motivation to go down there and get started on the work. first thing we should do is buy a dehumidifier

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

OH MAN THATS SO RAD

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

who wants to come to tom and jess's and re do the basement??

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

> Shows up

> drinks ~~your~~ my bourbon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

i suppose if i could ge the basement to be halfway decent hang out spot, then i could get a treadmill down there, its just right now its not inviting at all and i avoid it like the plague

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

> Does nothing else.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

üò¢

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I'm not much of a decorator. More of a 'move heavy objects'...er.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

great! i need that too XD

things need to me moved around before decorating can happen

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

oh right. I got some (bot) followers from the toronto picture I posted this morning so I'm at 199.

I don't need your fame, I just need normal knees Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

youll have normal knees

AND recognition

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I used to have a pin that said '90% of what I say is an anime reference'.

I should get that pin made up with '90% of what I say is a RWBY reference'.

ha.

Tyler never followed me.

That's 200.

Does Zeikani follow you Georgia?



SPOT THE LIE.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-22*

Car dealerships are pretty nice things to be the heir to

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

Alright, that's odd. Artoria Grey (that saber cosplayer I keep running into) likes the recent photo photo. I'm getting weird attention.

it's definitely Georgia's fault.

Also I reserve the right to snark the crap out of everyone I know and love, deal with it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

OOPS I KNOW THEM

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

*obviously*

Any and all attention I receive today is because of you.

I both knew that Georgia would hit me with the selfie thing; and that it would hit while I'm in this meeting. *responds anyway*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

HUE



ERIK THINKS HES REAL FUNNY

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I had half a mind to do that for the single/taken.

As if anyone could be confused on *that*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

People were apparently

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

people can dream, more like it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*



LMAO thanks bill

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I don't think I did put that there.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

Nah for the "people can dream"

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I'm confused.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

i said "people put single"

and you said "people can dream"

and i was like daww thats flattering

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

still confused.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

you gave her a compliment

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

People putting single is bad, it means they want to date you despite Hal?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-22*

yea but its still a compliment in a way ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

Lulu is 16.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

oHHHH NEVERMIND

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

Zeikani seemed nice at animenext, but we didn't talk for more than few minutes.

So. Effectively a stranger.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

*shakes fist angrily at the universe*

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

For what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

for not delivering the bill a wife

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

I don't think an Instagram poll is a good way to find one so...

Also let's do girlfriend first, jeez.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-22*

I GOT BUDDIES FOR THE COSPLAY EVENT NEXT MONTH WOO
One of them is like super famous with 13k followers on Instagram she‚Äôs my friends coworker but it seems like interaction with theirs posts is low, like only 30 likes per post. Hmm. Their followers mostly seem real I wonder why their interaction is so low, unless y‚Äôall are just outliers with super interactive fans.

Maybe a cultural thing? Hrmmm

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-23*

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Konkon photographer.

That's the pic Georgia had as her instagram profile for awhile.

and other photographers take photos of people *other* than Wezrez sometimes. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

lmao im everywhere

u cant avoid me

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-23*

then boom

Georgia

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Speaking of. That group account that message me, do I... want to try and shoot for them?

you know them, right Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

yeah its probably the blake cosplayer that messaged you

she was at otakon

shes nice

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

They said yang in the message, so I guess they're spreading out to the rest of RWBY then.

Lissy was going to message me after I commented on her lineup post...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

im just glad i got prime dibs on time slots üòé üëâ

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

"slots" Implies I'm doing anything but shooting with the people in this channel friday/saturday.

Though ngl, I originally thought you were the type who has a million shoots scheduled like Sakura or Marisa.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

i mean i have a couple

its by no means a light load at katsu

but as long as i get some good pics to showcase the cosplays and do some derpy groups with friends, thats all i need

anything more is just trying to get instagram content, which im never in short supply of anyways lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

yeah, but you ain't Marisa crazy.

probably my mistake for thinking Marisa was anything related to normal~ üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

ha fuck my computer only has one hour of charge now and this class is an hour and 20 mins

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I hate to break it to you, but battery estimates aren't usually accurate.

At least for me.

Then again, unlucky versus lucky.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

and now my comp is dying and prob wont last the class, butterfly effect, ill still have the notes

comp sci, how do i get max battery life

my brightness is at 0%

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Oh, I've got the answer.

Show up early enough to the lecture ‚úÖ to sit by the power outlet.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

theres no outlets in this lecture hall!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

sassy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

thanks rutgers

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I mean, that's what I did.

Course I'm always on my computer, so keeping it charged is like breathing.

except when I forget to bring my charger to the IBM sites, which I've been doing alot recently.

It's like 80 bucks for a third charger though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

idk i plugged it in last night so

who knows what happened

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

oh, and turning off the wireless can prolong the battery.

somewhat.

but the screen is going to be the biggest power draw.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

i take my notes on google docs and i think by changing the brightness i got it up to another hour and ten minutes, which goes almost to the end of class

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

chrome is also a resource hog.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

haha ye

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Learn markdown, it's good shit and take notes in that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

my boss would probably go ape shit if i brought a laptop to a meeting for notes lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

really why

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I don't remember the last time I took handwritten notes.

Japanese class, but I also stopped taking notes in that class in like, 4th semester.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

because hes 83

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

i only use handwritten notes for math and saltine cracker class

though people used laptops in class yesterday? like a bunch of people?

so i may be a rule breaker too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

do et

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

ignore cracker lady.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

yeah if she says anything ill be like oh i transferred in late and missed syllabus day

they doesnt have "no laptops" on her syllabus

she only said it in class

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-23*

I feel like shes not one to opening yell at someone

openly*

like if you were like yeet imma use it anyways shed be like "..."

or she'd whisper"dont do that plz"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

lmao i love how you're getting impressions on someone youve never even seen lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

HES RIGHT THO

shes so quiet and she doesnt look at people

so  i feel like she would look up and go "oh" and go back to talking

so ill sit in the back and do my notes that way anyways

where is the greek architecture in new jersey

talking about greeks is making me wanna do a pyrrha grecian photoshoot

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

"Excuse me professor..."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

"spartan women were beautiful. they had blonde hair. and nakedness"

"oh and by the way all the women slept with each other too"

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

are these things being said?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

these are verbatim being said

"why is everyone naked? someone? who knows why they were naked?"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

why did they have to be forced? was the gey sex just that good?

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

That's definitely not how I remember history class going.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

yeah the military bros just fucked so much

they were like

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

"they had amazing bodies so of course they wanted to show them off"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

"The wall graffiti around the Nemea and Thera gymnasiums are also testaments to the fact that the sight of muscled young men often aroused sexual desire in the onlookers. "

üí™

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Georgia, did you confirm your 11 shoot with that Ruby Saturday?
Georgia/Hal, is there are fountain at Katsu that's not used for the group shoots?
I feel like there was a third thing but I forgot

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

I mean people go to the fountain and get photos at different spots

use a good angle and the group shoots don't show

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

so there's no other fountain.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

don't think so. There might be one outside..? but even if there is it will be off due to the time of the year

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

hmmkay.

*I'm putting the most effort into the Weiss shoot and it's literally crammed between two other things*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeah 11 am confirmed

Holy fuck

Sakura san posted her photoshoot list

Or in a group chat at least lol



**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I'm missing context.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

did we.... have a plan to do....

photoshoots with sakurasan in summer outside of con?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

If we did, i didn't know of it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

see be non-con is doesnt mean convention it mean non consensual, as is she forcing you

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

***Savage***

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

***Savage***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

srsly though wtf?

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Hour of Arkos.
Hour of JNPR.
Hour of Renora. 

At some point everyone's going to hate JNPR.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

na bra

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

say that after you've been nora for two hours.

<@!245270932602486784> You weren't super interested in solo Pyrrha?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I have two other private Pyrrha shoots

So that's covered

Group shoots are more fun angways

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

alright, I'll strike that. We'll do one outside when the weather is better, cause I gotta ~~one up Ben~~ ~~compete with katsu photogs~~ ~~prove my superiority~~  take photos of v2 eventually.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Lmao I mean if there's free time I'm game

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I mean, I'll do those things after katsu.

Sun hours are so short in February it feels like I'm going to be shooting at all day, but I know I'm not.

And Pyrrha isn't a "Gazebo type" of girl imo.

Ooh, unless it represents the pedestal she's always put on that she hates....

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

gotta finish my jacket üòÆ i think toms costume is coming today too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I'm probably gonna get a lot of work done

I'm going home for the next 24 hours so

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

whooo!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Platinum RTX this year are $650 early bird, $730 regular price

What a scam

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

(RTX is a scam)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

tickets aren't available yet are they

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

~~ you would think with such prices they wouldn't have such a horrible customer service team~~

They aren't, only prices announced

http://roosterteeth.com/post/51627718

Bae were not going to RTX after this year I don't think, that's bullshit to make your VIP badge 730 dollars

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

You totally didn't want to go again right after in the summer, asides from visiting Ethan I'm not sure why you're going at all.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Hal wants to go

At least to try it

But it's such an industry con

They'd have to pay me to come after this üòí

730 bucks is like, you don't even care about your fans anymore

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

are you actually spending 730 dollars on RTX?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

That's exorbitant ticket prices, and sometimes you have to pay more on top of that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

$730?! lol for what just to attend?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Nah I'm getting the 100 dollar ticket because I go for dealers room and cosplay meet ups

730 is if you wanna go to a panel and not wait 3 fuckin hours

And if you wanna stand a chance at TWO autographs from someone

Not even guaranteed you'll get your favorites

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

jeeez

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Other than that, same as a standard 100 dollar badge

What criminals

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

we'll have to go and have a better time at Ota.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Roosterteeth knows it stands as a success story of "we made a living off being nerdy"

So nerdy people, especially the lonelier types, venerate them

Some sap is gonna pay 730 dollars to meet his idols and he's gonna get a pat on the shoulder and a picture

What bullshit

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

they're people. Who run a business. They doesn't know you from the shit on the ground.

And that's not even to insult them.

Millions of fans, you think that one particular guy who says 'thanks for making me happy' is going to matter?

You can only know so many people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

730 is ridiculous

That's almost a full week of work for me

And I don't even work minimum wage

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

and that business.

It's the reason I didn't like Vic at Colossal. He was all 'I love my fans, fans this, fans that...' It's not real. Don't feed people the whole 'celebrity person cares about me' illusion, it's not healthy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Oh I don't

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I mean, I am a cynic.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

But there's a ton of lonely nerds that do for RT specifically

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

But still not fair to anyone.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I knew a guy in high school who wore almost exclusively RT merch

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

you can make a profit and not be a dick unfortunately not many do, 730 is almost 2 weeks pay for me after taxes and benefits come out

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

you don't what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I don't venerate anyone there, I couldn't give less a shit about autographs codes and whatever

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

obviously lol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeah lol

Even 100 is a steep price, but I'm willing to take it cause the dealer hall IS big

I think this is a situation where a hobby because a business in a bad way

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

paying 100 dollars to buy merchandise from the company charging you 100 dollars.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Oh there were freebies too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

is the whole dealers hall RT?

like is there normal dealers at all?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I'm on Rutgers' science campus now and I think the engineering school tried to recruit me lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

you could get to Otakon, with a room, with transportation and a badge for 730.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeah it's "normal"

But it's BIG

And probably still have money for food lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I'm not surprised. Engineers are the cream of the crop. (At least according to my school, when we gave literally all the money to the Engineering dept)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

and still have enough to money to eat and buy stuff if your smart about rooms and shit

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeah after this year we're doing Ota instead

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

wait. Are you considering Connecticon because you aren't Ota?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

This year, Hal and Mak wanna  experience it, I got a decent network that's already invited us to their pool party which kinda makes me feel cool, ethan (and Casey?) will need our visit to adjust to the move

I'm considering Connecticon because I have no July cons

Also I went one year and liked t

It's pretty and they coincide with the food truck festival every year

The con has a bedtime of 9 which is lame but that's whatever

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

oh you have been there.

nani the fuck?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeah

Con ends at 9 pm

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

pool party at connecticon or rtx?

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

that's dumb. Though it's not exactly hard to have a good time at a con with your friends.

RTX.

She was at one last year.

Remember, Labinnak likes Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

RTX

But we can have our own Connecticon pool party lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

idk if were doing connecticon we allready have 4-5 big cons

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

4.

Katsu/Zenkai/Next/Colossal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

yea but im counting anime nyc as like a half

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

pish posh.

You don't need to take off work.

which is my only concern with doing more cons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Zenkai is honestly not a financial drain tbh

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

No, they get you a *great* deal on the rooms.

Unlike fucking Next.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I consider Katsu and RTX and Colossal the thick bois, and then Anext is like a medium boi, and Zenkai and Connecticon anime bois

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Colossal east is not a big con  like that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Zenkai and Connecticon are extremely comparable in size and quality of cosplay and attitude of cosplays

Nah but it's an expensive BOI

Why does BOI keep getting capitalized what

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

true, though 209 a night is a *really* good rate compared to the regular ones at Kalahari.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeah it's still Kalahari tho

Which ups the price compared to a comfort inn lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

you've stayed off site alot, that's true.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

also id like to be able to take a vacation with just tom this year too since we haven t been away, together, by ourselves since the honeymoon

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

*and yet they STILL pack the cosplay stuff*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

hell no

well.... maybe

yea all out trips last year were cons or VT with my brother so ye between cost of that many cons, and vaction days and shit i just dont knoe if i can swing a 5th con

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

you should go to a resort

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

esspecially in such close proximity to next, and colossal and also july august is prime vacay time

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

theres one nearby that'll be lots of fun

its the gaylord üëç

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

lolss

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

that's not nearby tho.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

as far as going to a resort it is

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

im mean technically Kalahari is a resort and its like an hour from me

crystal springs is like 30 mins not even

WAIT are you guys bringing bathing suits to katsu?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-23*

ya kno

i always consider it and forget it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

i usually bring one if i think there is any chance of me swimming , and then pack toms too so he cant get out of it lols

did you guys ever ask about connecting rooms?

nbd if not i just saw it on their site so it reminded me

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I've been on hold for 40 minutes.

This is an internal to IBM help line.

naze.

should take out my switch at this point.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

so at anime NYC i totally though myface looked broken out, but im looking at the pics and my skin looks so good wtf? did u shop it billy? XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Nope.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

what makeup did i use that morning sheeeet

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

People tend to be hype conscious about particularly things going into photos and that makes them promanent to them. If it's really bad, it can make it prominent in the photo too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

ye tru

i gotta iron that cotume

ooo sept that on pimple üòÆ thats ok thou cuz you took all the pics on the other side mostly XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

the follower boost of Georgia Meddling ‚Ñ¢ has stuck thus far.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Bless my minions

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

( ‚Ñ¢ was my favorite emoji, whoever didn't get that should be sad.)



It's even next to my name on the work Slack.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

i got it right!

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

lol that looks terrible in the user list.

or generally.

Oh shit. I forgot to do something this morning.

Jess: "I have no followers except friends lol"

_shrugs_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

Now I'm giggling all alone in the lunchroom like a crazy person though

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gathering/2018/01/23/otakon-rwby-sat.html I did those this morning and forgot to upload.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

*Sniffs the air*

Ah yes photos



Were these two actually making out

Cause I wouldn't even doubt it if they were

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I don't think they did. There were other shots in the burst that showed them not.

What, do you know them?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Nah fam they just look SUPER into it

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

true.

I dropped half a dozen photos of Gen and Rob kissing as Renora.

I figure it'd be tasteless to post them now.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

Yeaaaaaaahhhh smart move

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

(They aren't my favorite Renora anyway)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

whos your favorite?

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

You haven't seen them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

you have pic?

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

nope. They don't even have pictures yet.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

wow what a couple of LOSERS

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

*sound of my uncontrolled laughter*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

watch actually isnt us and i just dissed some poor people i dont even know

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

yaaaas

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Alright, shooting for Monica and Cameleonkids girl.



<@!245270932602486784> it's official now, I'm brainstorming with that name.

Also <@!245270932602486784> Reiley isn't planning a "secret" Vernal right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

I don't think so

Honestly I'm tired of Reiley's "surprises"

It makes it hard to get photos with them

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Hence the "air quote" kiddo.

But Vernal would be a lot of fun with v4 Weiss so keep an ear to the ground.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-23*

True

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Oh noes, don't let that hella cute questions thing go around.

I can't do that level of sugar.

(Rebecca's story)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-23*

tfw you gotta drag yourself out of bed because you want to make a post on social media to commemorate the anniversary of a novel but you don‚Äôt have the image you wanna post on your phone or online. UGH

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

It's not one of mine?

Le gasp.

Do I want a sarahah?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-23*

It is but it‚Äôs so far down in the Flickr it‚Äôd be easier to get the image off my flash drive of narcissism

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

Lol.

I have to see if I can hack the plugin that generates the galleries to provide a download link from the site.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-23*

HACKS
Illegal. 
Sarahah call the police

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

So got Ren cosplay in

It's actually super nice, ever so slightly small

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

which doesn't happen much for you I'm sure.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

Yeah it's wierd

So it all fits good and all but if I take a deep breath or bend over the back button pops

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

yikes.

correction, yikes unless you rig cherry blossoms to pop out.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

So I'll prob either need to deal or modify it somehow

/shrug

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

Is this Lissy?

Also:

<@!245270932602486784> is that chameleon person?



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

Yeah that's Lissy

And yeah that's chameleon

Good eye

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

I should recognize Lissy by now.



Caption this:

*"I can't wait to teach her how to die for a camera and make Bill cry!"*

GUYS.



DO you see that?

its... 0.

Yes, I skipped three group shoots, but it's *zero*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

üôåüôåüôå

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

And....

*ZERO*

RIP Persona Saturday at AnimeNext, Fire Emblem Friday at Otakon, and Fate Saturday at Otakon, but I'mmmmm donnnnneeeeee

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

Woahhhhh

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*



Thank god for lazy editing the group shoots. Fucking stairs ruin half the good shots anyway.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-24*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

NO BACKLOG YEEEET

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-24*

why is instagram not posting my tags and descriptions

how can i credit tilt worm

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

It worked Marisa.

*short moment where I wonder how I'm going to keep myself occupied on the train I till Katsu backlog.*

*remembers Aurii is a thing as well as Switch and the other 600k words in the RWBY loops.*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-24*

it only took 4 tries yay!

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

For internal use only.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

another for the list? http://www.greytowers.org/

also are you just looking for planes to take cosplay photos or regular photos too?

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

Column A, Column B. It started for portraits though.

The Photography section is exclusively regular photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

okthats what i figures, ive never been to grey towers but is pretty and castley

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

it looks pretty legit yes....

AAAAaaand *I don't think you have to pay to shoot there*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

oo also the sunflower maze tom and i went to was p. shitty like 5/10 would not recommend, overpriced, and not that impressive

oh nice!

buttermilk falls and millbrroke village are both along a road that was used during the revolutionary war, there are many abandoned and historical location, as well as roads that go down to the river. in high school me and my brother did a photoshoot for a school project just traveling down the rd and stopping to take pics. plus its all state land

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

abandoned building can be good shit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

ye boiii just gotta be careful, my cousin and brother have gone inside a few that were open  which is 1 illegal and 2 v. dangerous

but yea theres a bunch of places to hit up along that stretch they just arent marked on maps

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

yeah, gotta find that kind of stuff too.

I need to call Grey Towers now... It's weird, I don't consider what we go and do to be a commercial shoot; I don't have light equipment, the outfits/makeup are already ready, it's really just walking in, taking photos. boom.

So I don't know where it really falls on people's radar's.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

yea its like niche thing

your not making money off it either

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

nor are they commercial use photos.

^

And maybe that's what I should just say. Mr Chicken basically said show up and take photos, if they complain they complain.

Plus there's always the 'we're students' excuse.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-24*

Art photos. Artsy fancy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

ye thats always an option

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

Like I'm not a pro, I shouldn't have to act like it.

I ain't making hundreds off these shoots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

or... anything at all lols

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

tru.

> Messages Jess Braun about Arcadia
> "New phone who dis"
> We went to *preschool* together.

at least that's what I expect.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

oh i thought it happened

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

it really might. I don't think I've ever really texted her, if she lost my phone number she wouldn't have bothered to ask after it again.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

just say who you are in the text

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

pfft.

I said 'my cosplay friends'.

She'll know.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

oh tru lols

heres a list of some of the  official historical locations along that rd i was talking about,  not including all the abandoned shit: 
https://www.nps.gov/dewa/planyourvisit/scenic-drive.htm

gotta fins some nice abandoned factory for some nier pics XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

so anywhere in Newark.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

yea but id like to not get shot

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

cosplay photos, bullet to the head.

gotta weigh the options.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

this site looks like I made it html 101 but:
http://abnf.co/newjersey_abandoned_buildings_large.htm

half those places look like we gon get murdered but ya know

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

could be fun.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

getting killed? XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

trying some of these places.

but sure.

*and I'm the depressing one*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

LOLs

thing that sucks about most abandoned places is its illegal to be there and you can get fined or ticketed D:

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

That's when you run, apparently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

im bad at being bad

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

you think I'm any better?

I know Katy snuck in somewhere in HS, and I heard stories from those photographers I met in NYC.

Morning Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

id just cry if we go caught

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

(I'm not crazy, an instagram notification popped up from Georgia okay)

I mean, same.



The office building has a social networking site (stupid, I know) and I saw it while checking a thing for the building.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-24*

Do it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

ooo food photography

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

meh.

I have a job.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

plus then taxes become a pain cuz thell probably wanna pay you on the books and then you gotta get files as a 1080 employee or whatever and blah blah blah

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

wait what?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

i think a 1080 is code for a contract employee? i.e. an employee who doesn't work for someone full time

opps 1099

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

Yeah, I wasn't thinking *that* hard about it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

lols sorry

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*



AN INTERESTING MORNING, I HAVE WOKEN TO

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

I mean.

_shrugs_

She doesn't usually vote in your things(?), and besides that everyone and their mother already knew she was going.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

She doesn't participate in ANY thing, I don't care for the most part? But I'm ever so slightly flattered

Ya

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

It was probably labinnak.

I wonder if labinnak will be at Katsu.

like, the real labinnak. Not mango-loo.

*pfft*

it's just like the bloody Katsu groups.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

My cousin paid $240 bucks for 25 photos with her newborn baby

The camera quality was good but the photos weren't SUPER impressive

It helped that her baby is mega cute

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

I believe I've read that photographing babies is hell, so.

Steamdumpling enough with the lewds on my feed.

Are you and Georgia keeping a list of these titles you've been giving me Tom?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

titles?

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

go read one of Tom's captions.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

ohhhh those

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

Huehue

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

Teehee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

yooo <@!245270932602486784>  you use fake eyelashes?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

Ye I do

I have like no eyelashes so I gots to in order to get that anime look

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

what brand? are they hard to put on üòÆ ive never tried them

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

It's an acquired skill for sure but after you get it it's pretty easy

I used one brand for a long time, they weren't to be anime, just to compensate for my lacking lashes

They're pretty cheap

Ardell

And then I got some Sephora ones

Those are anime

They're "Audacious #21"

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

Sephora? I got a hook up for Sephora. Katy's like, gold silver premium platinum there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

do you feel like they add alot to your cosplays?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

Gasp

I think they do

I use different lashes for different cosplays and I think there's a noticeable difference

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

I think they do too tbh

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

someone get Kpop boy eyelashes.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-24*

Gotta get me some üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

I wanted to order contacts for katsu but they wont be here in time  so maybe i can compensate XD

maybe ill pick some up and try them out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

Yeee

It's worth a shot

If you do, I can give you all the pro-strats

Also they don't come with eyelash glue so you'll have to get that

Brand doesn't matter I've found

Though sephora sometimes comes with glue, I never use that one

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

üòÆ

can u reuse them?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

Yeah for a couple times you can

That also requires pro-strats lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

ohhhh ok cuz i was gonna say $10 for one day is cray lol XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-24*

There's certain things you should and shouldn't do to preserve falsies

Yeeee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

oooo ok youll have to tell me when i get them XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

There's a kiosk in WTC that sells emoji pillows. I'll have you know I looked to see if üòÆ was one and I would have bought that shit.

oh good, <@!288513265661902858> Does Georgia abuse the üòò emoji? I feel like she does.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-24*

i don't think so 
it hasn't become bothersome yet

its usually üòâ üòè  or a heart

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

That's the emoji on Tom's and mines Facebook chat

I'd be so excited to find a üòÆ pillow

My formal Nora dress says it was delivered!!

Pray to the cheap clothing Gods it fits

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

I mean, I returned more than half the peices of the Pilot getup.

But it was too large, which I'll take.

(the replacements will be here within a week, that wasn't a bailout.)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

yeee but i ordered it like 3 weeks ago from china soo i cant get another in time XD

every other dress i found that would work was like $100+

if it doesnt fit i might have to go on an emergency mall scouring trip

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

to woodbridge!

Or willowbrook, since that's apparently bigger?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

id probably try rockaway first tho

Guis the dress fits thank the cheap clothing gods



**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

Bless

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Jess where u get that dress

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

Amazon for $25

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Link? :3

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

It took like 3 weeks for delivery thou üòÆ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Youch 
I'll still risk it

It looks nicer than my current one and the Jaune/Nora dresses are really similar in show excluding color

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B010DLRTIG/ref=ya_aw_oh_bia_dp?ie=UTF8&psc=1&th=1

_meatloaf flashbacks_

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

oh yeah. I was never caught up on that conversation, but I've been listening to meatloaf since I was a kid.

One of mom's favorites.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

oh it was lyric video  that misspelled a bunch of words

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-25*

I've never turned the sound on though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

my sound was off i wante to make sure it was off but i hit the wrong button and it went up lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

i think musicalys are so awkward and annoying tbh

usually the lighting is meh and the angle is meh and its very awkwardly obvious lip syncing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

i hate them lmao I follow a freind of a friend that posts 1 like 3 times a day

i just found ethans business card in my purse, I dont remember him giving it to me

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

*hears him yelling at someone one office over*

*nervous sweats*

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Pilot boi.



still need to get the length hemmed, but second size fits well. I probably shouldn't be bothered by the fact that I've returned every piece of clothing I bought for this thing because it was too large, but it is annoying.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-26*

omg ye I unfollowed Brit cuz of the Musiclyss so annoying

"Are you thor, god of hammers?"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Pretty sure the cleaners in town can.

I'll have to go there... soon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

oooo neat

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Yeee

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

I'm saying It's not enough data to warrent excel.

_continues to preach the markdown religon._

also, I'm suprised that lissy shoot doesn't involve Meg.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

yeah shes yoko on saturday

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

oh right. makes sense.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

so bill sakura only wanted to shoot 3-4 saturday

or wait

4-5

_how am i already fucking this up_

did you wanna do like 30 mins genderbent arkos right after?

like super chill

a la how we did otakon

cause i dont want you to  get photographer fatigue lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Yeah we'll be doing plenty of chilling.

I wanted to book time so I can dedicate my time and planning efforts into them GOOD shots.

Particularly Weiss. I'm upgrading the process for that one, both because I like Weiss and because the familiarity makes it easier.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

:>

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Genderbent is the last thing Saturday, before formal right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

yeee

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

So after that when can just be chiillll.

Not like I only have a camera at shoots.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

after genderbent?

or after formal?

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Genderbent.

I'm expecting to be hanging with you guys most of the weekend, asides from the shoot hours. And you're in half of those.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

true true

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

SO.

Apparently a guy I knew in middle school (was not friends, don't have any friends from middle school) is engaged to a cosplay model. Heard that from Mrs Braun.

I look up the name.

https://www.instagram.com/aljcosplay

(His extremely conservative parents are not amused, apparently)

SO.

Interesting.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-26*

I recognize her from something

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

HA thats hilarious

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*



What's this just thing? I had Konkon up a month ago!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

I was just thinking that

does meg know where to get your photos?

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

90% sure.

I shot her a message anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Whoaaaaa where did she get THOSE

I never saw this set

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-26*

it says at the bottom of the picture

cant read it though

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

She HADN'T seen mine shit.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-26*

WHAT

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Oh wow I found the other photos now



Remember this candid

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Was I there for that?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Hal was gonna say "remember the pumpkin pete underwear" and then I screaming and covered his mouth



That's a good one too



As is this one

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

aww these are so cute. photographer dude why u no finish before christmas?

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Whose idea was the pose?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

The photographer lmao

But meg is a friend so I'm like cool sure

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

Hmm.

I dunno, I'd feel like a creepy suggesting things like that, even if it's for a good photo.

Like, the idea of "kiss the camera" would have been a good shot but I'm not going to suggest it you know?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

ooo tru especially is photog didnt know you

**Bill** - *2018-01-26*

I'm probably too reserved, but I can't fathom where the line actually is on it.

The far end is hounding someone for boudoir, the near end is never taking the photos.

So he more forward than me.

I want good photos yes. I REALLY don't want to be seen as creepy, and that fear far surpassed the creative urge.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-26*

Yeah megs a cool bean so I was like weird request but whatever

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Omg I'm calling the copyright police

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

omg that‚Äôs hilarious

You have to fight them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

Whoa trippy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Hmmmm my day Friday of con doesn't start til noon...............

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

Don't you need all that time to ~~sleep~~ get into Pyrrha?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

friday morning: film Billy Raymond Photography vs Tilt Worm battle

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

If I wake up by 8:30 at latest, I've been Pyrrha enough times to git gud at putting her on. Plus a lot of the upgrades have sped up how fast I can put her on

So I'll be on the con floor by 9:30/10

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

speed pyrrha

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

_shrugs. _

You told me you weren't game for stuff till like ten. Then I figured eating would be a requirement. So noon it was.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

eating at a convention. hehe.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

OH YEAH EATING

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-27*

OH YEAH

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

I've got to location scout at some point ether Thursday night or Friday morning.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

that's what fruit roll ups and granola bars are for. and coffee pot ramen but that's dinner.

biru did you read the stuff in cosplans in rwby chat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

O ya did you want to get Thursday photos of your favorite father-daughter cosplayers üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

We'd be basically redoing ANYC's photos but we can. Kind of out of material for the two.

But I wasn't scheduling anything Thursday cause I have no idea when we'll be there.

Is Weiss's symbol on the v4 outfit?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

Where?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Back of the jacket

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

Hmm.

Theme idea.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Wassup

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

One of the stills in the RWBY manga highlighted Blake's ~~legs~~ emblem on the side of her tights.

A series of shots highlighting the emblem might be interesting.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Oooh cool idea

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

Requires though, lest it end up a bunch of pictures of your back.

is it on the back? Or are you adding it?

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/f/ff/Weiss_Timeskip.png/revision/latest?cb=20160701205444

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

It's on the back in the real showwww

I thought



Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

wow RT. when your concept art doesn't even show the concept correctly.

Notes from working on Weiss shoot:

I confuse emotions with themes. I think. The emotion isn't a strong theme on it's own, it supports the theme.

And I refer to this pose as 'feminine sit'

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*



PA POW Weiss shoes done

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-28*

Looks good! üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

Thank ya ü§ó

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

Damn grrl

**Dave** - *2018-01-28*

RIP feet

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

<@!245270932602486784> FYI, the manga did an alternate take on Weiss's snow pea outfit. Well, that's what I'd call it anyway.



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-28*

gotta show more skin

so I bought some cosplay makeup the other day, whatever I couldn't find at the dollar store (which shockingly has, like, everything pretty much).
secret to japanese cosplay: all the makeup has glitter in it.
especially powder. so glittery. it's just normal powder it doesn't even advertise having glitter or sparkles in it but put it on and bam you're a disco ball. disco cosplay

tfw someone messages you in formal japanese so you painstakingly spend half an hour drafting a response that is equally as formal, and they respond in english. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

Cries I fucked up the Weiss dress by making it too small

I'm gonna take a break and figure out how to fix it later

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

<:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

https://www.facebook.com/thedodosite/videos/1499980790136591/ have some cute corgis. That'll help.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-28*

Sorry day happen fren,mine smol too but I didn't make mine

üò®

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

THERE ARE TEARS OF JOY



This is a preliminary test but OH BOY

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-28*

<@!245270932602486784>  I is home

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-28*

damnnnn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-28*

OMMGGGG thats soooo cooooooooool ahhhhhhh

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

My DAMN.

I can't whistle via Discord, but I'll admit that was my response.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-28*

Georgia: Makes transforming dress
Me: considers duck taping a zipper in

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

IT TOOK FOREVER BUT I DID IT

Im not telling anyone but immediate friends tho

Surprise for the RWBY shoot ;3c

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-28*

üòÆ

it looks really cool

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

Incredibly impressed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-28*

I didnt buy a separating zipper üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

I see Ethan is giving the rest of the team some more FaceTime.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

yeah good on him

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*

I think it'll pay off in the long run.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

definitely

makes him more appealing at least

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-29*

Is it really cosplay if you don't getting super stressed about something

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

concept: You are at a convention. You finished your costume weeks ago with plenty of time to spare, it's perfect and requires no more altering or gluing. You wear it all day and it's crafted so well that nothing breaks or tears.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

Amazing

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

also watching my friend meg get ready for the masquerade at animenext was hilarious, she had a staff that lighted up and her solution to that was getting lights, turning them on, putting it in the plastic orb of the staff, and hot gluing it in forever because magic staffs are hard to recreate irl

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-29*

Thought that you just widdle it and the fancy blonde hair mage dragon boi finished it for you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

how ya'll live stream working on cosplays? I got so frustrated today, that shit would have been so embarassing on video XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

Have a meltdown and make it your shtick. Rage quit cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

lmao my claim to fame is looking me right in face

this week: watch me have a breakdown over buying the wring type of zipper

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

I'd watch it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

there was almost crying very good stuff

then i ripped the zipper out, onyl to find out that i could convert it becuase i dont actually need the zipper to function, then sew it back in for the 3rd time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

Omg that sucks

It would be cool to function tho

For those cold Katsu breezes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

Yeee but I ended up trimming back the sides anyway cuz that collar was ridiculous

But it look much more accurate now so worthüëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

YEEEET

Megs ex-boy is posting again, good to see people getting back on their feet

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

wait, they broke up?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

Oh yeah

I heard it was messy

Meg was fine about it, he wasn't

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

Proooobably tbh

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

Can't tell me Tyler, Brandon, Meg, Lissy, Danielle don't have some feels after spending all the time they do together.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-29*

Beast boys voice actor is one hell of a druggy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

OMG i had a dream i did drugs guys

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

YOU WERE THERE TOO? I WAS AT THAT PANEL TOO THATS WHAT I WAS REFERENCING

What if we sat next to each other

Wow

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

it wasn't a panel.

It was before uncle yo's show.

Which yes, you were with us for Marisa.

Remember the time before you registered us as more than 'table' or 'chair'?

~~good~~ times.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

O
He also had a panel. I looked up the video I took of it I was gonna scour the crowd for Tom and Jess.

Ooooooo

That was like 30 years ago. Good times.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

i remember meeting you very briefly in the hall

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

you can deny it all you want.

We waited on line together for Uncle Yo.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

I can‚Äôt even remember the last thing I ate I am sorry

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

Was that stiletto ruby year because I couldn‚Äôt find my boots

I think it was <:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

it may have been?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

We gotta go back in time

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

I don't think I took a full body photo of your Ruby.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

Good because stiletto ruby was horror

I found the boots the next day eyyy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

should just wore converse or something lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

buT

the stilettos were the closest thing I had to her boots and I just threw some red ruffles around the edge and laced them with red parachute cord and bam

Ruby boots that are like 50 inches higher than canon but shhh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

I thought you bought new ones?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

there is no way to make a shoe like that comfy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

Japanese cosplayers turn everything into platform shoes
If you‚Äôre not 10 inches off the ground are you really cosplaying in japan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

Working out, if you get through the initial slog, it a rather addictive activity too.

i know people have had issues with her for a loooong time, like that whole kanna cosplay debacle

https://imgur.com/gallery/pYMcK

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-30*

yeah, i mean I've heard soo much shit about momo tbh

She also got Lipo and kept saying it was from her *hard work* ie. working out

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh dear.

o the callout post has been a week-long thing where they keep compiling things against her. They brought up the kanna stuff 4 days ago. silly me.

**Bill** - *2018-01-30*



Now that's a priceless posing tip.

Really.

I'd link the source, but it's a rather pointless 33 'how to pose' guides that could build more bad habits than good ones.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

mostly for upper body shots and ones where the costume covers the stomach, because if you have a whole body shot and you lean forward u gotta suck in your gut too. üò≠

mostly 4 fatsos like me

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-30*

pffft fatso's like the tiny grill

**Bill** - *2018-01-30*

Shirt alternations: a few bucks cheaper than ordering another one, not worth. 
Leather hemming: also as expensive as the item and takes a week to do. These intentionally came unhemmed though soooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

If you bring it to my house I could probably do it? Workmanship wont be as good though

the pants i mean

**Bill** - *2018-01-30*

You got your own stuff to do.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

Someone mentioned tape...

Normally I wouldn't care but I'm spending a lot on katsu as it is.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

ye hem tape

there self stick and iron on

there might be more type but those are the only ones i know

i think the stick on is for temporary and the iron on is for permanent?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-31*

The interesting fact?

The interesting fact? Mangaloo is actually part of a cosplay duo,  with the cosplayer labinnak who is busier and doesn't use social media as much. 
 the writer hopes Labinnak gets more recognition at some point

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-01-31*

I'm going frame by frame through the grimm bee fight and they absolutely did that for every cut.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

emphasized her emblem?

**Bill** - *2018-01-31*

yup. Just about every scene.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

interestingggggg

**Bill** - *2018-01-31*

it's a very monty thing to do.

Well the new models suck for frame by frame breakdowns.

surprise surprise.

while I have half a dozen other series to go with, still a shame she did about 3 different motions in that 10 minute fight scene.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-31*

There's far less motion per rapid pausing.

v3, Weiss strikes the same pose as she does in the lancer fight but you can tell how much natural it looks.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

<@245270932602486784> are u finishing v4 yang and Weiss for katsu?

**Bill** - *2018-02-01*

Okay. I realized I haven't asked since Pyrrha day 1.

I don't expect we'll do all these at Katsu. Even if we had a full hour or two I wonder if we could pull it off.

But split like this it'll be easy to pick them up another time.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

nice meme

been trying to find characters that I can make without a sewing machine and 500 hours of hand stitching, or ones that I can buy for relatively cheap (i only buy if i can purchase it cheaper than the materials to make it), but also characters who aren't Japanese or asian because I don't want to be a weird foreigner cosplaying a japanese character among a billion japanese cosplayers. so my options are a little limited but i brought Zelda and Mari with me because mari is kind of only half japanese right? she's like half american? and I bought a new saber costume because she mega popular and not japanese

what i hope happens when I cosplay this irl

i'm trying out a new solution to the backless dress since all my cosplay stuffs I normally use is on the other side of the planet, will update in a month on how that goes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

i want to find a way to make the wig really awesome if i do squid
yee
i saw someone at animenext with the most perfect squid kid wig, i complemented it but I should've asked for their secrets

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

How they do!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

hmmmmm. top side = wig hair. bottom side = vinyl maybe? with a foam core? hmmmmmmmmmMmmmm. that wouldn't work for long squid hair tho.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

I guess you ccccccould technically do a humanized version

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

but squid

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

Yeahhh but difficult

Most.cosplays I see are with hats on

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

ye

a lot i've seen are like this which are neat, but if I made one I would probably get a long wig and extend it down (glue it down to the fabric, while leaving the sucker side as plain fabric

nintendo had official cosplayers for it but they kind of weirded me out I didn't like their wigs/hats either. *too* realistic.

these guys

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

Lmao, yeahh, most cosplays are wigs with hats and the ears on the sides

The plastic ones are more rare

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

rare squid kid, highly collectible

speaking of wigs. time to iron mine.

Emo zorldo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

they are SO super strict on cosplay over here, like official rules for official events, but I'm curious how much they actually enforce some of them given some pictures you see.

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

why was Tom up at 5am though?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

party time

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

I was chasing jess around for reasons and I stubbed my toe really bad last night

it woke me up

does the cosplay rules depend on the cnvention or if you are a paid cosplayer?

could be that the "model" ones get more freedom

or again they might just not care that much

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

hmmm
it's mostly stuff on crossplaying, especially guys dressed as girls. All the events I've seen say that if you're a guy crossplaying, you can't have leg, arm, or beard hair. You need to shave your eyebrows too. You can't be bald or have cropped hair, you gotta wear a wig. but then you have guys like ladybeard and the sailor fuku oji-san who are famous so hmm.
most cosplay events you also have to pay to get into, and you have to change there. if you arrive in costume they'll turn you away. i've only been to tinier events but I'm going to a big one next week to test the waters.

OH or cover up with makeup. if you can cover your beard stubble and unruly masculine eyebrows with makeup to the point they're unnoticeable that works. the cosplay makeup store had stubble makeup the other day.

they also have rules for girls cosplaying guys in that you gotta get your chest as flat as possible

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

That's.... Odd

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

if cosplay is an attraction why do cosplayers have to pay extra <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
comiket is free but to cosplay is like $8 or $15
same with niconico choukaigi i think. i wanna go back to that. but creepy dude 2 years ago and i wasn't even cosplaying uguu. *i need cosplay friends guys get over here*

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

Where are all the people from your manga club during the study abroad?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

they don't cosplay (fukubuchou does lolita but that's different), and also they have tables to man. like next week the cosplay event is the same day as comitia and I know some of them always have tables there. at comiket they'd be at their circle's table.

hobbies are a lot more niche here they don't always cross over too much like in the US, and if an artist does cosplay they'll do it at their table ;u;

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

couldn't you cosplay at the table?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

i don't have a table :0
i'd have to be in a circle to help out at a table and i can't draw kek

thus it's much easier for you all to fly over here

also i don't think we'd be good enough friends for them to let me sit at a table with them ; u ;

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

Let me know how it goes when you go üëå

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

If you bring them more people because of your cosplay skills, they'll probably be game.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

purrhaps but tables are so tiny

they're as tiny as all the google image search results
why so tiny

this is the space of one table

another thing to complain about: alphabetization 
i was sorting stuff on archive earlier and there was a drop down list with anime/manga. something that starts with "Life" is in the la/ra section because it's pronounced "raifu," which made finding "Little" so confusing because life and little are in different sections

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

you're doing something wrong there.

You know how there was that push by people to turn on post notifications cause of the algorithm? I don't need to.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

nah

wat

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

Asides from the Ben photos, pretty much all of my friends tag me in all of the posts they make. üòè

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

the thing about hiding notifications was for likes, only if you don't check instagram for like weeks on end and then post something, it'll withhold likes because sneky

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

Trueee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

I can never take any of Sarah's lewd pictures seriously because her bedspread is the same one I had all throughout highschool  XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

would cosplay D&B be worth the effort involved or do we just go to D&B for ourselves.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

just go and chill XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

_why not both_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

cuz organizing is hard

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

I dunno, I don't feel the need to figure out their party packages and stuff?

*because they'll just lose everything again?*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

nah just us

but also

cosplay

JNPR goes to D&B

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

who dis?

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

Ethan's ex-partner.

Georgia, did you miss the thing about having a dramaless weekend? üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

It's still Friday technically üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

Ughhh what wierd stufff

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

probably the casey break up?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

Yeah probbbb

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Or the business stoof?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Yeah he asked about me Casey ethan and hal

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

moi?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Which were basically ethan needed to communicate better (he promises to now) and I called ethan asking for an update, and Casey took it as orchestrating the break up

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

pour quoi?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Yeah apparently ethan was "ranting" which I don't like cause it means the matter isn't emotionally solved for him

But I'm electing to ignore it cause diplomacy

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

tell me more I love hearing dirt on myself

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

It was just that you talked to ethan and he got all defensive

That's it

I guess Johnathan and Ethan are back to being cool partners though

Well not business wise

But like, friends

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

OoOoOoOoOoOo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Johnathan is only contractually hired for the business

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

When was this though?

I didn't really ask, but I was getting the impression Ethan's overall response was different yesterday than it was before.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Good point

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

If this was before that, it'd make some sense.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Nah it happened today

But it wasn't frustrated

It was more exasperated

That makes more sense

Johnathan was never articulate tbh lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

hmm.

But as I didn't ask, why was it so different yesterday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

That he calmed down?

I guess?

He's had like 6 hours of sleep over the last 48 hours, that's probably it

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

I'm sure that's not helping

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

Is my sense of time skewed or did something else get updated yesterday

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

what do you mean?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

Idk you're saying he's so different yesterday versus before

And I feel like its been three days

Day one was his bitchy response
Day two was his super sorry one

And nothing happened yesterday

Unless my sense of time is skewed

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Day 2 was yesterday no?

God so is mine apparently

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

No cause I feel like I remember Georgia telling us the about the better response on voice chat

And she wasn't here yesterday

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

She called him Wednesday and she got the curt response. You messaged him Wednesday right, and he called with more details. I sent him a message yesterday morning, and Georgia made it sound like it was a different response. (I didn't ask for details, which is what I'm doing now, cause I was trying to avoid attention yesterday.) Now we're at today, where he talked to Johnathan.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

The sorry one was yesterday right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Yea

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

I think me avoiding attention yesterday cause Hal to be confused.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-02*

It's that going to bed at 5 am Hal <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Literally when I woke up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Lmao half u no sleep like regular boi?

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

Call one was when casey was in the car and curt with Georgia.
Call two was after that when he apologized cause Casey was in car.
Call three, I thought, was yesterday morning.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Yeah

And today he called Johnathan

Can he wasn't angry, he was exasperated

Fifty million years later, I have acquired Ben photos

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

What, fall Pyrrha?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Yeah

He sent me preview pics one or two times, and then it was radio silence

I still think there's some left to edit?

He has a new GF that's takin up a lot of his time, but good on him, she's cute

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

That's nice.

Are they...

üëÄüëÄüëÄ

Good?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

You want to see üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

I'm not sure. Are they good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

I like the way he does color

But I think I look a little stiff

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

That doesn't help me know but show em.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*











Yeah I look so stiff orz

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

The first one is better than me. Second and third I'm definitely better. The last two I could pull of better I bet, but props to him for location scouting.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

First one I can totally chalk up to the tree we found tbh

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

I think... hmm, I don't call it a win cause number one is damn good. You aren't even super in focus and I'm impressed. But it's not a loss.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

It's a Rica fight ;V

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

NOOOPe, that was just mobile that first one sunk my battle ship.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

REALLY it's so dark tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

game over man. game over.

It adds to the mood of it.

you'd lose the texture to the background with light boosting.

Those are uncropped too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Probably would have to brighten them for Instagram

He tends to stay pretty darn

Dark*

Works for photos, not for social media lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

could be unedited.

That second is definitely unedited.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

I did tell him to just send me what he had

Cause patience is not my virtue

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

_dis is not da wae_

It's interesting thinking about how cosplayers cosplay

Like what they focus on and stuff

So interesting

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-03*

Like which details?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Like Sakurasan spends HELLA money on photos, a bit on cosplay, and nothing on construction

And then I pay HELLA on construction, but not much on photos

Like there's hundreds of cosplayers and they all focus on different things

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

You have people who shoot for you for free though.... üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Ya cause they're my buddies and do awesome work ‚ò∫Ô∏è

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-03*

that is in my arsenal ye
but a lot of people have been interested in french here and there's a lot of french classes
my go-to are hebrew and romanian if i must because what japanese person is gonna be interested in those

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

Where you all find this drama lmao

~~You all~~ Georgina

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Bill doesn't feel like taking any pictures with her anymore.

But as this is all in private I'm not sure how to proceed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yeahhhh I'm gonna let it slide

Hopefully my story post cleared up any other confusion

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Very classy yes.

I like the part about needing hugs. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

üòè

Hal is a true good excuse should actual creepers pop up tbh

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Right, that came up yesterday didn't it.

Besides, with my camera gear you can always be going to a shoot.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

TRUE

So between you and Hal I have my bases covered, should the situation arise

So, tackling this going forward, maybe I pop a message in BNE saying "wow can you believe someone thought I hated them"

Which could prompt snow to come forward themselves

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

That sounds viable. Shows you trust the group while being subtly PA to ~~bitch~~ snow.

Commenting about moving past the drama of the last week or two (like I said here) is what I was thinking...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yeah I'll do something like that

BOOM DONE

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

*subtle*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

üòè

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

You need subtlety lessons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Whaaat no I was so subtle

Don't look at me, I don't know who it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

You guys are volunteering too much information and are too in sync. üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Hal obviously has been drafted on the scenario

It makes sense

But EH ITS AIGHT

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Less passive.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Eh snow should step forward if they wanna save face in my eyes

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

But you don't know who it is.

Remember?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

I'll act like I don't

But in realityyyyy

I don't feel like confronting people, I'll let the drama blow over, but my respect isn't going to be as "there" as it was before

Not without an apology or SOMETHING at least

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-03*

Funny thing

I actually didn't hear about this drama from Georgia

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

You don't want to sound like you're calling Snow out, it's too passive aggressive, gives her fodder to continue being bitchy. you want to express that what she's said is wrong while implying you don't have the details on who it is. Makes them feel guilty, not attacked.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-03*

Like at all

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Being manipulative and all that.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-03*

My response about it was 100% separated from Georgia informing

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Totes.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-03*

No like legit

I got the details from David too

Cause steelwolf was bothering morninggmist

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

What.

Guys.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-03*

And we then started talking about morninggmist

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Ah.

Jeez.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yeah David was the one who told me

David was trying to dispel the drama early

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

Doesn't seem passive aggressive to me

If *someone* is doing that they should stop

A teeny bit of aggression is fine

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-03*

Between Georgia and I
Nothing in the northeast rwby community goes unheard

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

Yeah lmao

It's not just breakup season it's drama season too aparantly

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Indeed. Let's just try and pull out of the drama a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

I mean this one got figured out early

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Well, it still happened.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yeah so at least it's waning

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Mhmm. We don't want to stress anyone out.

Drama's bad. I feel the need to defend my people from it. I dunno.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Gotta get some good vibes goin

I'll try to do something nice on Insta after dinner

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Just enjoy Florida, we focusing on Georgia not Wezrez.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Trueeee

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

People starting drama with Wezrez cosplay can blow over to affecting you personally. That's what I don't want to see.

I need a soapbox emoji for how often I do this.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

True true

Zenkai rejected the RWBY panel idea

But they accepted a Bojack Horseman panel?

Well it didn't get REJECTED but it hasn't made the first schedule

There's still more slots to be filled

But it hasn't been accepted yet

Why is there a Bojack and Archer panel but no RWBY?

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Wait, I vaguely recall this panel idea.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Yeah I submitted it

But Bojack and Archer? Really?

Not one, BUT TWO MLP PANELS

TWO Steven universe panels

A teenage mutant ninja turtles panel?

A panel for just Yuri on ice

NO IPHONE ITS NOT YURIA

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

But refresh my memory on said panel.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Just an in character Q&A

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Wasn't it with someone?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-04*

My phone constantly is trying to correct things to Aurii terms

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Like someone not Hal. Deca is standing out in my head though that can't be it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

you are correct when you say someone not hal

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

I can't remember.

I don't think it was anyone from BNE or Sakura.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

Did zenkaikon release its panel list already
That‚Äôs odd

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

It was Gen first actually

Not all the panels, just the preliminary ones

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

They didn‚Äôt even finalize the main events yet hmmMMmm

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Was it Gen? Really?

I'm going crazy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

is the link on their website?

what was the RWBY panel idea
they try for variety and have weird rules about what to accept but I don't know the people who make the schedule so idk what their bias is
I know the people who finalize the schedule but they're older folk who aren't familiar with much outside of  classics and modern mainstream anime

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

doing a FNKI shoot is going to be hard.

Not exactly much in the way of fanart or canon content to work from.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

FNKI
im jelly
we just dabbed when we did FNKI

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

who wanted a fnki shoot?

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Lissy and her friend.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

do what we did and just dab in like 50 different places

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

lmao true

some renora photo ideas might work

one spunky character, one more composed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

is this for katsu?

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Katsu yeah.

ye the entire 50+ gallery for Renora is shipping I believe.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

hmm. i would recommend finding a flat place where neon can get above and have flynt on the ground OH like outside where there are decorative garden things

will neon be on skates

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

not sure.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

have her be super careful if so because i gave my photog a waiver saying if I died it was my fault :3c
nearly fell down several stairs eyy
once you get up there it's super easy (if you're good with skates) but it's climbing up that's a pain

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

you gots to do it on your knees

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

I used Weiss's section of their fight for some v4 combat ideas, as I recall they weren't particularly well animated either.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

omg the knee idea is genius
but neon's got them darn white kneepads, i made them out of wimpy craft foam so it wouldn't of worked then
if the katsu neon has stronger knee pads that could work

take pictures at the rave
fnki rave

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

I'll figure it out. I don't know why I'm doing these, I should go to bed since I'm in a funk.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

how about back to back stuff like



or i was trying to find a back to back dance image to illustrate another example but found this instead

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

most of aurii chat is awake actually

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

aurii is woke

take some of these idol poses and throw fnki into them

you're that brown cat on the bottom left right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

i'm the one on the wall upper right

cautious yet intrigued

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

well Flint worked out fine.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

Guys I want to claim top spots on taiyang and steel them from erik

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

~~stop making out with your daughter~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

I won't

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

welp.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

As in I won't make out with my daughter

Not I won't stop

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

oh.

yeah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

üòè

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Then I suppose you got a chance?

I dunno, Taiyang is kinda Erik's definitive thing, like Weiss/Pyrrha for Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

üòé

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

hush you, it's not a compliment. This is about Hal.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

üòé üëâ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

Bill but you see 
I'm decommissioning Ozpin for most cons, 
So right now my thing is tai and Jaune

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

~~Because Georgia likes Blonde Bois~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

whaaaat

nooooooooooooooo

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

but what about Knight Boi.

Also have male Pyrrha.

Georgia as Pyrrha, Hal as Pyrrha: "If you're Pyrrrha, and I'M Pyrrha, whose saving Jaune?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

I don't like my male pyrrha enough yet

Also I actually do like being taiyang

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

well, Partnering up with a Raven is probably going to fall in the category of 'So and So cosplay's Taiyang'

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Taiyang has done very little in canon that makes him interesting. Even his emotional scenes don't transition well to cosplay photography.

He's cool, but still a bit character. We've never seen him fight, and he supported Yang as Good Dad ‚Ñ¢ via his words, not his actions.

I *suppose* you could beat up Adam in a non canon way.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

I am bringing a watering can to katsu

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

That or completely recreate chibi. I mean, actually fall on your ass on a skate board for the photo.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

Maybe a fake flower bucket

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

But that's not cool, and cool does better than lol long term.

I believe. I'm not a marketing person, obviously. Georgia does all my promotion.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

I think iconic is more important

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

üòÖ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

As of right now flower dad is big, as well as various chibi memes

I mean currently the top taiyang is also Christmas stuff, that won't last

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Web series: Taiyang Dates.

Dates Cinder, Neo, Raven, Salem, Torchwick.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

So much chibi to catch up on

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

As if he was at a speed dating thing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

I'd do it lol 
Get random friends and goes on "dates" with them

Not even just rwby tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Short and sweet. 3-5 minutes.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

Thatd be fun

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-04*

that tai ren date

Nora all pissed off

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

it's not even a video. It's just Taiyang tied up the the chair facing the camera, Nora walks in front of him in the frame, leans over to put her face in the camera with a big smile on her face. The the hammer pops out from behind behind her back and she shush's the viewer. Screen goes to static.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*



üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

A. passive apology without actually acknowledging it. (Fair, since you theoretically don't know what she said)
B. Manipulation to redirect your hunt from her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Yupppp

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

Shhhhiiiiiit

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-04*

oooo

lol

"I think you're the most nicest and approachable people"

-tells people not to approach you-

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Speaking of bill, what out-of-con photoshoot ideas did we have?

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Weiss in church. Did you miss the shoot location map I've been doing?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

I feel like I saw the location map, did it have the ideas on there

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

No specific shoots but it's gotten rather large. Might help.

So white trailer 1 somewhere churchy, maybe one of the castles on the list. White trailer 2 at that castle area in Central Park.

Oh idea, <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> if we can find one of those village ruins on that one road you were telling me about we could do a Kuroyuki shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

ü§î hmm maybe I don't know if there's enough houses in one spot to constitute a "village" though ... There might be

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

We can keep an eye out for the idea though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

Ye that be sweet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

PLZ DO IT

BREAK MY HEART

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Oh, if you Georgia up a Cinder and we can find a good location for it, we can try doing a combat renactment of Pyrrha v Cinder.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HVDEpKSmRWukN61k0H4cyFQOPP7u_ynT&usp=sharing <- This Georgia.

You got something in mind Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Nooooo just spitballinnnnn

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

the long vowels mean you do tho, usually.

There's plenty we can do though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Idk I'm thinking I want some Pyrrha in a more Greek lookin architecture

But idk where that would be found

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

I tried to look around Ceasers a bit the other weekend, I at least ruled out instead.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

just buy those cheep prom collums

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Lol. I was talking to Mr chicken and he offered to let me borrow a green screen but like... ew.

I ruled out inside.

Wait, I thought we were road tripping to Virginia for columns.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Oh no that's Tennessee

Thats The Parthenon

I'd actually be game üëÄ

It's a public park so you can prob take photos

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

You wanna do a 5-8 hour drive one way for photos?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

toms somewhat astranged brother lives tere lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

My uncle has a house boat, pontoon boat, and two jet skis on the lake an hour or so away SOOOO it could be a dual purpose trip

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Aasssss long it's not a one day trip I'd consider it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Nashville has a lot of live music bars too Bill :)))))

And bourbon :))))))))))))

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

The bourbon would be interesting yes.

But when am I not down for plans?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Touch√©

That hillsborough park had a Greek statue garden too

I don't think I spent enough time there tbh

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Mm. The farm?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Yeeee

The farm connected to the park area

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

That'll be a good day too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Yeah we gotta do more location shoots

Outside the stress of con time

I feel like I take more time on make up and posing and it shows ever so slightly

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Soon as the weather gets warmer.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Agreeeed

Justin had to drop chat

_immensely tempted to change my Katsu line up_

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

To what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

Probably a full day of V4 Yang

And then I could wear Star Thursday like I secretly wanted to ;)c

Ladybug is great but I hate not being able to use both hands through the gloves, and the face mask is annoying

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Marionette might be nicer.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

True, i have the pants and jacket

Do I have time to custom order her shirt though?

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

For the future, not Katsu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

OH yeah

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Marichat is the best combo tbh.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

;3c I'll get hal in that suit someday

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Well, Gen is doing Winter on Sunday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

Just let me know if we have to change ours üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

üëÄ



**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

That's a good thing for him.

Honestly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-04*

I recommended it

Glad to see he took the advice

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

Take some time, get your social life in order, come back with a new outlook.

That's our Georgia.

I shot a message to David earlier if he wants solo photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

Awwww that's nice

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

It's not really karma persay, but he's done good by Georgia and he apparently really likes what I do.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

i mean

thats totally justified

and we didnt even ask him to keep the drama on the down low

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

I have to check, but it looks like I'll just do some before GBJNPR.

But pseudo karma.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

GB?

yeah its pseudo karma

hes a good egg

and we dont actually know him THAT well

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

I'm guessing he got hooked up by Sakura judging by the enthusiasm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

???

what do you mean?

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

I just expected more "oh my god yes". That's very David. I get the feeling he has plans already and is good, but wouldn't turn me down.

So maybe sakura hooked him up with her photog.

I'm a pessimist though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

i mean sakura is kinda dragging him around lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

I'm not sure he minds though.

And she'll take care of him at least.

Does he always like every message you send...?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

Yea

We we're messaging a lil the other day I think it's just a thing he do

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

So much enthusiasm.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

He wants to follow sakura around

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

Who needs rooster teeths $25 tshirt and bad customer service? Not this girl

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

YEEEET

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

now i just gotta hope my jacket emblem come out good and I think thats about it on the katsu prep

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

I mean. good on you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-05*

And was like "that's to much work" and muted the whole thing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

**Bill** - *2018-02-06*

It would be fittingly appropriate though.



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

Like girl you already had like 15 what you doin!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-07*

that is 15 too many jello shots

jello shots should not exist. it takes something pure (jello) and adds alcohol to it.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-07*

Ikr?!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-07*

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

No Jell-O shots at Katsu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-07*

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-07*

*grabs safety Tom*

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

Everyone buddy up, yes.

<:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

As Georgia was apparently working on cosplay stuff and hasn't resurfaced in hours, I assume she's coming back with a completed dress of some kind.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-07*

georgia returns in 6 months with a fully functional mech suit

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

That'd be Greg.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-07*

haven't seen any cosplay from him in eternity it must be true

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

I'm sewing snaps on, it's hell

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-07*

omg i found snaps at the dollar store and bought them because jo-ann's $3 snaps can't torment me again
the equivalent of dollar stores here have everything. all my dishes and cutlery are from there too.

an entire costume full of snaps

there was a livestream once of people at registration giving out badges, and one guy made a dress out of the badges for himself. they said that maybe the next day they'll only wear the badge dress so as more and more people register the dress gets skimpier and skimpier.

me at home: breaks 15 needles in one hour
me now: *desperately sewing for 3 days and all the needles are still pristine*
***break one of you, break!!!!***

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-07*

Damn that's nice!!!!

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

Sunday I'm katsucrunching

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

I mean, I lack things to crunch.

*technically I cou;d plan for sakura-san shoots thurs/sun but their optional and idc*

mm yeah, if I go it'd be to hangout but I know you like to focus when you're working. If you got legit crunch to do I'll refrain so you can do a focus.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

Nah im inviting people cause I intend to get mostly done by Friday night

Otherwise I wouldn't open my house üòú

So you can come on through

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

Well, I don't have plans. üòÉ

It ok I have the power of 2,616 followers

Also the top two move on anyways

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

*passive aggressivily doesn't vote for Ethan and Casey*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

LMAO



Three followers just came out of nowhere

Suspicious

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

Don't you always have new followers coming in though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

im sure it ussually isn't 3 in one min lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

I have 6 different social media account for tlt_wm.

between them, I have not half the followers of Georgia. 90% of which are from instagram. Why do I bother updating the lot of them?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

it's fun :3c

you have more followers than me u are +fame

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

updates are automated. I don't touch twitter, facebook, and tumblr. Flickr is an image dump not an sns.

oh wait, that's why. I don't have to think to do them.

Don't you have a ton of facebook page followers Marisa?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

ehhhhhh. yeah the twitter and tumblr stuff isn't really showing up if they're automated like that, the twitter ones get cut off and the tumblr ones won't show up in searches

I have around 500 but only like 5 people interact with anything and 4 of them are relatives that don't know much about cosplaying

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

thats ok 50 of my insta followers are family and fb friends

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

i would get followers on tumblr after a con for posting pictures but then i got lazy with pictures and stopped uploading them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

i have no idea why those people havn't unfollowed me like they prob think im weird as hell, im probably just a spectacle to them XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

I mean, how many people followed me because I know Georgia?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

at least georgia

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

,...

That was really good.

I'd give you an award, but you don't want to be at my level of snark.

it's not healthy.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

HONESTLY the struggle for a hotel was frustrating me the most

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

is this the big par-tay house?

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

I doubt it's the mangaloo party house.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

so many houses

so many parties

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*



**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

OMG!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

looks like she says an original design based on Glico Mont Blanc (the pocky company?? they do have mont blanc pocky but idk if she's basing it off the pocky or the cake itself, probably the cake)



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-08*

Ooooo

Food...person....

hey <@!301927856240459777> have you ever cosplayed Victorique? I feel like you would have

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

I've seen events trying to get VKS groups together.

Don't think any of them worked though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

Idk I think JNPR cherry blossom boudoir is better

Also dawww Erik sent me a sarahah



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-08*

How do you know it's Erik tho?

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

If you lot want to do JNPR boudoir, better not eat salt for the next week.

It's probably fitting that's the only tip I remember from the panel at Colossal.

Probably should have taken notes, she knew her shit.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-08*

Hahahaha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

Point your toes

I remember that

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

Right, cause you want to show off curves. That flexes leg muscles.

I think.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

*points my toes, immediately feels gym soreness* can confirm

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

üö≤

Not that I ever expect to shoot boudoir. Like, I'm awkward enough already.

There's a perfect dog line emoji for that and I can't use it cause mobile. Sad.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

What's better than pointing a camera at your half nekkid friends tho

Just guys being dudes

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-08*

"*What's better than pointing a camera at your half nekkid friends tho*"

quote for the history books

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

You know you can see Hal half naked anytime you want right? <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

Not any time I want, I respect his personal autonomy

I'm out here respecting mens

You know you can see Hal half naked anytime you want right? <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Aaaah, truly what I'm missing in life. A lovely girlfriend who supports me and pushes me into getting naked with other men.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

I mean technically any of us can support you into getting nekkid with other men

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

The spark just isn't there.

Also I was just feeding the quote page. Girlfriend yes, yoai nah.

Ok so this Yang wig is mcmurdering me

So I have three options if I wanna Yang Thursday



The wig that is mcmurdering me



The volume 4 concept art



Volume 1-3 Yang (sans like 50 accessories cause they're in the basement)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

V4 concept art

it looks comfiest

and thursday is a comfy day

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

Yeah I wanna do the first one but the wig is SO THIN in the ponytail

Next time I'll get a curled one to make up for volume

Also the second one negates me needing to finish the robo hand

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-09*

V4 concept

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

Aight it doesn't look too stupid?

It doesn't appear in the show but like... its concept art for V4....... good enough

Also it's Thursday so fuck it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-09*

No it looks cute!!

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Yes, concept.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

Yeah Thursday is too much for full volume 1-3

Also I hate this wig

The ponytail one

Okie so I'm going with V4 concept art

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-09*

Lol I thought it was the same wig üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Just took the pony tail out and curled it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

Didn't bother to braid it til later, but Jaune is officially gonna be the comfiest ~~until I get the armor from hal at least~~



**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Could always not armor mode.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

i mean i dont care about being comfy on regular con days lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Why not both.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

I mean it doesn't matter cause top 6 move on and we're #2

But damn still wow

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-10*

I know LoZ isn't very romantic or valentines day-ey but it's the only one I currently have (~~also chise but I don't have her wig and that's also not super valentine-y~~). I'm stopping at 7/11 in the morning before the event, what chocolate do you think zelda would have/eat? ü§î pocky is ez but I can't quite imagine her with that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Pockyyyyy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-10*

idk how long it'll last but for as long as I've been here every basic pocky flavor has had an anime boy on it that's supposed to be that pocky in human form, and the back has their stats on it

these guys

Oooo Ryan's Gon be penny?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

Watch he'll be able to string them together and spin em around like some fancy boi.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-10*

Considering his hair defys space and time probably

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

I can't wait for tragic redheads huzzah

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

I have to do... something... about those chap legs.

Fold the extra in and duct tape it to the inside. that'll work right.

what if I just... don't though.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-10*

I mean... Could work?

Obviously sewing is always ideal

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

not for leather.

I'm not super motivated to do at all though. There's already so much to pack, including formal stuff, and I like packing light. Plus mobility for photos, Katsu is good cosplay.con and how much shooting I'm doing.

the room's going to be crazy too.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-10*

/shrug

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Time 4 sweatpants weekend

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

He has a charging dock

Duh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

Do you sleep in jeans?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

I wear pajamas. Often don't both packing them to a con cause what the hell, but.

I've seen enough overweight dudes in sweatpants and excerise pants at college to know it looks sloppy.

I try to dress well, to show I give a damn about my appearance.

I'm sending out copy and paste shoot confirmation things, do I need to bother with you lot?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

Jnpr at 1 on Friday , renora at 2 on Friday?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

yup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

Then I'm good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

For me? no.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

There's the floating PJ JNPR and Formals photos, but their at night some time.

I have no contact with Ginny <@!245270932602486784> so you're in charge of that. Course, it's first thing friday so we can leave for it together.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

PJ JNPR I think we just spitballed doing before the PJ party

I'm getting Pyrr-jamas on at 7

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

tom and i are gonna  go to the maid cafe at 4 on Saturday any of you guys want me to put you in the reservation?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

You also wanted to gb Arkos a bit.

Hush. You realize you're pretty much the reason I'm going to Katsu in the first place? I said from the start I wanted to hang with you and Hal and now Tombo and JessJess. If we do so while taking photos that's okay.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Touch√© it's all hang out time

We never take ourselves too seriously during photos anyways lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

I don't understand why

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

lesbians

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

In that case B is gayer

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

ITS THAT STUPID YUKINA POOPHEAD

I just want to know _how they do it_

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

Yeah tbh I usually could give any craps but like

This time it just doesn't make sense

There's a better ship photo for their pairing

They don't have a ridiculous follower count boosting them

So why

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-10*

I also suggested doing PJ JNPR Thursday night since hotel rooms will be nice and neat still. well fiut it in somwwhere

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

Aight katsu crunch completed üëå üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-11*

Velcro for transforming dress Ren?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-11*

Lmao how'd ya know

I legit tied elastic cord around the one button and looped it

So it's a little loop button now

Chest is still a bit tight but who needs to breathe anyways

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-11*

cosplay hax

**Bill** - *2018-02-11*

s'long as it doesn't rip.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-11*

I strained it, it's pretty strong

And it anything rips it'll be the black k pop thing he has under the jacket

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-12*

breathing? in cosplay? it's less common than you think. #7 will shock you! click here.

georgia did you tape your shield to the ceiling

also i like how this image appears to have a dead body in the background

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Nah it's magnets

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-12*

magnets??/ /??? youve developed semblance

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

I clicked, nothing happened

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

I had a dream that somehow a bunch of nudes of me got leaked to instagram

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

<:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

it was very stressful

also, i had a dream i lost me wedding ring in a lake

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

At least you have a wedding ring.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

BRUH

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

oh wait, that sounds angsty. whoops.

**Dave** - *2018-02-12*

So you're saying Tom's a better photographer than bill, but he can't show any of his work

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I was implying you don't have a bunch of nudes for instagram.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Which, correctly, provokes the lenny.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

actualy in the dream it was my ex who did it which male 0 sense wtf

cuz he dont have any

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

You existed before Tom?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

YE i was born 2.5 months before him

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

BT Jess sounds weird.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

why dat?

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

_shrugs._

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I mean, I've know you as Tom and Jess for so long it's kinda a given.

Plus, you didn't like me for the first few years you dated Tom too. üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

truuuuu üò¶

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

You may have been a serial nerd dater, but you weren't ready for the ***Alpha Otaku.***

*Please kill me*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

mmmm you see i dated derek fulcher thou

he was cringe level, not as bad as calvin but.... yea

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

cringe factor is not tied to ***Alpha Otaku*** status, unless you're calling me super creepy then I might cry.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

no im saying it make no sense that i disliked you

super hypocritical

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I didn't have long hair.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

tru, neither did derek, but i was a freshmen who wanted to date a senior to be coo

that didnt work LOLS

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

It doesn't matter. There's no point in saying you regret something in the past. If anything was different in the past it might not have brought us to here, and I'm quite happy having you a best friend.

Wise words from Bill of the day.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

Picture this:
Tom as Ren competing in the Tekken tourny straight faced, while Jess watches in suspense and cheers as Nora.

Cuz thats exactly what happened last time, just out of costume

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

tom wins, makes super level headed comment to opponent meanwhile im like "YAAAAY!"

did u make sure you can sit in that costume?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

I didnt but im pretty sure i can

i had a decent amount of room after the mod

found out that Ashley and Dan dont drink either >w>

*dab*

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

<:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

they actually are debating skipping collosal cuz theres "too much alohol"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

noooooooooooo üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

rip, I don't need more non drinker friends. quota is full.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

thats rude

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

yes, yes, more for the SUPERIOR non drinkers

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

That's not rude. This would be rude:

Edit: I don't need another pair of couple friends being cute around me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

WOW i was just going to say "non drinkers dont bother me unless they think they are better than people who do drink"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

>w>

*sips choccy milk*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

ok jesse gabel

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

lmao you got the meme

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

ashley and dan dont drink cuz it will dull their sweet league skillz

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

yeee, im scheduled to play exactly 1 game with them tonight

then they need to sleep so they can get thier 8 hrs NERDS

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

They just think you're going to suck.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

nah I'm higher ranke then them <:lenny:395307171539189760>

nah real talk tho, ive played probably 6 games with them and weve never lost, they are pretty damn good

**Dave** - *2018-02-12*

Good time to start losing

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*



They're so dating.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

yee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Yaaaa

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Why can't people still call dating? Watch, I'm going to find out I "talked" to a dozen people and I had no idea.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

<@351785752197201920> did I here league with 2 other people can I join

Also Bill I think it's cause dating now holds some kind of weird like stigma or sound to it nowadays

And don't be that surprised if you do find out you've "talked" with a bunch of people

Cause I apparently have done that many a time completely cluelessly. 
Which usually ends with either me awkwardly being like not into you sorry, or them realizing I act like this with most people

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

*but then how would I know how to advance it if there's a mutual interest I can't see*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Well for one it needs to be mutual, you forget in this model the people interested in you/think your interested in them as well might not be people your into

Then again I'm also a libra, so this might not be the best comparison for you

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

The prior doesn't make sense to me, but I think that's more english language than star signs.

Forever alone forever ‚Ñ¢

Tangentally, Wild Mass Guessing:

Rob was significantly older than Gen. Rob's quiet and we found out in JNPR chat he isn't much of a partier or drinker. Gen is in the "Party room" for RTX, and has been doing stuff with Tim (who was apparently drunk all Otakon?) and the others in a rather party ish way.

Could it be Rob and Gen broke up because of maturity levels? One wants excitement and parties and the other just wants an SO? *Does this sound familiar yet?*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Who is Tim

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Tim Roland? Male Coco?

Nice guy.

Was at roller skating with his mini gun.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Ah male coco

Casual reminder that I don't really know any of the zenkaicon people beyond their cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I've had like, two conversation with him.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

But I find it helps if I remember them as people, not cosplays, since they won't recognize me as 'oh, Qrow 532'.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Ye 
I don't remember the names of people if I don't associate with them

Ye 
I don't remember the names of people if I don't associate with them

So like chris Tim john Karen, or whatever their names are, all are just generic fellow rwby people that I saw at *insert convention/cosplay event*  in my head

I only recall Chris ATM cause he definitely gonna be dating gen

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

hmm. different strokes for different folks.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Ye
Tbh with the number of people I meet I kinda have to do that too... 
There's only so much space in my head for knowing people

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Forgive me if I lack sympathy. üòõ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Lol wasn't aiming for it

Tho for real people don't get how tiring knowing a lot of people is üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I wonder why I go through the effort? It's not cause I want to be friends with all of the people. I'm stingy on who I get close to, because I invest in friendships.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Well maybe it's cause you see them as good potential friends

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Not every rwby I remember the name of.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Or you know that your going to run into them a lot so you kinda keep tabs on the names

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I'm stingy on that too, in a way. (For good reason, look at this server filled with beautiful swams. You're all beautiful and lovely. And then me. ü¶Ü )

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

There's also the fact that you meet them through a different lens

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

*haha, literally*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

You meet them as a photographer, we meet as cosplayers
Lol ye

I feel like its easier for cosplayers to remember each other as "that person who does x cosplay"

Cause it's how were remembered in turn?

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Yeeee, but I still occasionally call people character names while shooting.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

/shrug

The world may never know

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

probably not lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*



Why do you tell me this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

üòÇüòÇüòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

what a bro, telling another bro his plans (i assume you don't know this person do you)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

bruh

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

i do not lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

that's amazing.
he's not even initiating conversation, like he didn't ask you a question or give you any opportunity to respond. just out of the blue "hey here's some personal info"
inb4 the girlfriend messages you or georgia out of the blue and is like "hey my boyfriend is proposing to me"

they treat you like a diary and you learn their whole life story without ever responding

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

#differing maturity levels is a theme huh

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Daaaaaym

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*



When is that *not* Casey's solution to a problem?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Lmao I totally didn't just think the exact same ething

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

No homo guys



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

You do look handsome, this person is correct ;3c

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

I just like the need to go no homo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

They have to emphasize how much they don't want to have wezmelt break up

Because they're not tryna hit on you

Duhhh

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

Really 
I thought it was cause of their fragile sense of sexuality

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Naaaaaaaaaaaaah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

oh hey hal, no homo, but you looks good in glasses

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*



Anyone wondering which is probably Rebecca on Eriks?

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

If he's choosing colors that related to the person it'd be purple, but that'd be one hell of a misunderstanding.

Think she PM's him?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Also I talked to Erik on Sunday I wonder if I'm the purple

Yeaaaah probably

She at least replies to his stories

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

all 4 million of them?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Prob üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

If he doesn't realize it at that point, I'm killing him.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

It's real easy to spot me and Tom on Eriks lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

if its color coated do we wanna take stabs on each color

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

it's probably not.

Too much rwby influence in me saying it. üòÖ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

tbh if I didn't make mine explicitly to be sappy I would have made it color coated

coded

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

I'm the last one üòè

Jk jk jk

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

"may be taken"

*I dunno, she seems close to that Tom guy....*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Look some people are oblivious idk

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

i dunno isn't she dating that bill dude

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*



Found myself on Davids lol

I'm mom role model I'm pretty sure

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Niceeeee lol I'm hoping I was one of the many "adorables"

üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

David sounds like he'd date... anyone... though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

<@245270932602486784>  are you bringing got2b glued?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Nah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

A compliments a compliment man

And okay

And it's better than "she married" like das no fun

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Eriks a Virgo

Time to tell Rebecca to give up :V

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

Lel

But like what if Rebecca is the brown one

I'm the a bit young lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

ARE YOU

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

No lmao

I'd hope not cuz we the same age although I could see.someone making that mistake

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Eriks phone background is Blake, Rebecca cosplays Blake it's a sign.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

You every have a wig on... Then take it off... And then when your real hair is in your face you think it's the wig hair.... Freaky

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Spoopy

Damn every time I slow down on cosplay, the radio plays a jam and I speed up again



**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

<@!245270932602486784> play along in BNE.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Okie

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

helpful.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

So what are you trying to do

IM NOT A GOOD FAKER CRIES

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

she can't join any of us tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Proposing she should try and go to RTX with Erik, using you and Hal as a buffer so it's not a direct suggestion.

I know she can't join you. The idea is to make Erik say "maybe I can ask?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

Erik seems pretty determined to keep his RTX journey to him and whoever he's taking with him üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Did he?

I haven't seen that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Yeah we asked to room with Erik earlier

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Ooooh, lol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

I'll go fix my reply then

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

RIP.

Still, it's subtle pairing them together.

leave it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Oop

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

nah, it works.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

now she has to go to erik lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

*correct*.

I can be manipulative when I want to be.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Yeah Eriks adamant about bros weekend

Interesting

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

The person he likes is actually.... a dude.

rip rebecca 2.0

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

about bros weekend?

is he going with a dude?

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Ohhhh did he ever say "guy"?

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

90% sure.

Old roommate I believe.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

huh
never saw the guy part, always assumed it was a chick

cause like thats the only reason I could see for going down as only a pair and not rooming with anybody

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

He's never done a big con.

He's probably not comfortable with the sardines life style.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

still like

hotels are usually designed to handle 4 per room

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

And if he doesn't want to share a bed with somebody?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

right

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Hey who's looking forward to that _pre-con shave_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

Kick ass.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*



Weiss' jacket should've been sleeveless

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

You'll have Many, many jnpr chances. Tom and Jess are along on for every con I am.

Except connecticon, which hasn't been figured out.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

Dawwww not that I would blame you

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

But Zenkai and now Next have formals too for formal Weiss.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

White Knight is a ship you know. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

ooooo das right there it is. don't break the floor.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

~~a lame one~~

Curse you, I had to double take at what that said

Aurii has ruined RWBY

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

~~Rwby ruined Rwby~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

floof can really make a costume, a lot of people here don't use petticoats even though it would look so much better but i guess they take up too much luggage space

some people wore their pettis under skirts to the location but they weren't very floofy, and the floofiest ones would just be awkward to wear in public. sad.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-14*

I mean nevermind that it'll be under the jacket BUT JUST IN CASE

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

Don't use lenny for grievous injuries.

But yes, fotos

**Dave** - *2018-02-15*

Chopped off your arm for cosplay purposes, risky.
Should double it...

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

AYYYYY

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-16*

i saw someone cosplay this in a tuxedo and thought it was cool.
this is the official stage play outfit tho. I thought cosplayers tended to make things lewder, not more conservative. what animator designed this.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-16*

Ussagii????

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-17*

Ryan Emerling is that you

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

I was going to offer to video call you over breakfast but now I'm not.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Wow biru got really proficient at changing his *race*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

i understand now. by "i'm not" biru meant he was forgoing breakfast and is still 500% doing the video call. i understand.

should i put on cosplay

i'm gonna put my wig on so if you don't call you can suffer guilt knowing that somewhere in the world a nerd is sitting around in a wig for no reason and it's all your fault <:lenny:395307171539189760> ~~no pressure i need an excuse to style it anyway~~

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

You don't wear a wig everyday?

I thought you just cosplayed all the time in weebland.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

no that's not allowed they very strict on cosplay. we got scolded for being like 6 inches outside the cosplay boundary last time. there was a cone that marked it duh we should have known.

[shows up to interview in haru's ballgown] yes hello i'm ready to be hired. what do you my attire is problematic. this is one of the fanciest things i own.

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

So desu ne

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

if y'all want to plan a video chat lemme know the time and place. i will travel to video chat in person and give you chocolate to keep your sugar levels high for the con.

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Too early for me.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

get woke

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Or be half asleep for an hour and a half and it'll count as some extra sleep.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

acquire sugar

u consume too much sodium u need some C12H22O11

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Sure.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Why you up so early Billy?

You were like gone by 7

Half our room still isn't awake üëå

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

wat
wake up y'all it's con time
get ready get goin'
you'll miss those 8am panels

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Lol panels üòè

Me Jess and Georgina are up atm

And Billiam is.... Somewhere

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

draw on everyone's sleeping faces with sharpie marker <:lenny:395307171539189760>
it'll be ok they can cover it up with makeup probably

if you have whipped cream that would also work

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Don't have whipped cream but what if I did owo

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

I'm at the lobby bar area.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

omg if you had whipped cream you should totally use it to paint people's sleeping faces

biru pls it's like 8am

do you need an intervention

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Why? I like being out of the way with my morning and shower, both for my sake and so everyone else can make up. I wake up early for work (7 when WFH, 5 going to NYC) so it's normal. When I drink I usually wake up early too.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

don't you want to be surrounded by 15 people trying to do their makeup and get ready all at once. it's part of the thrill of a con.

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Plus, I had a nasty crick in my neck and I didn't want to wake up David adjusting to fix it. So I said fuck it I'll get up.

I want them to be able to focus on said make up and not have me in their way.

Also there are no 8 panels.

There's only one at 9 too.

A miniatures painting workshop.

(I figured I could sleep in a panel room instead, no dice)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

convention acrobatics. trying to dodge your 32 other roommates trying to get to the bathroom and seeing a piece of yourself in the mirror but realizing you forgot eyeliner on the other side of the room and returning.

no ye no allowed in panel rooms they gotta set up, plus they usually have rehearsals for stuff at awful times of the morning like that.
video programming should be 24/7 <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Or I can stay on this couch.

Irl Tony Stark from Otakon is having his breakfast here. Awesome.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

did katsucon do away with a physical copy of the schedule? all I can find is the guidebook app

otakon is my favorite movie

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

They have one.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

they just didn't upload it on their website. boooooooooooooo

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

I lost mine and don't super care, since shoots all day and wanting to rest when I'm not.

I'm with you, the physical one is easier to read.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

i've always wanted to go to that one panel that lasts all night called Are you a Werewolf? or something like that. they've had it at multiple cons for multiple years so I guess they're pretty good at werewolf hunting.

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Alright Mari-chan, it's up to you to decide who wins the PDA off.





**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Got me mid tackle üëå

**Bill** - *2018-02-17*

Why are you trying to Lenny a time.

Are you turned on by time.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

no i'm trying not to just turn every transition in this amv into a fade *but guess what's gonna happen anyway haha yolo*

one of my clips is lower quality than the rest and I can't figure out why aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
if anyone sees the katsu amv contest (usually it's at the masquerade or closing ceremonies) pls tell how it is I think deuce runs that one too

the major issue is they roll sentimental and romance into the same category because no one ever enters sentimental lol *but not enough clips to focus on just 2 characters in this series so i cri*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Aww rip

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

There's a really really awesome/perfect AMV idea I have using bmblb from the rwby soundtrack but I can't get the anime I want to pair it with. also i only read the manga and saw part of the first season for it so I'd be really lost until i watched it rip

I just went down the atrium floor and doctor strange from ice skating is here!

He was not waving his hands around this time tho.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-18*

how stingy are they being about the ball? I see pictures of peeps at the ball in costumes that seem like they wouldn't be allowed due to skirt length :0

which is shocking considering how strict they were last year uou

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-18*

I didn't see anything scandalous

**Bill** - *2018-02-18*

Me either.

The rules say nothing above knee level did y‚Äôall see any shameless above the knee skin/socks

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-18*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-18*

wat
come on ball organizers what's the point. didn't they do something similar last year. uguu.
zenkai is having a video game-themed string quartet for the ball this year so it better be lit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-18*

Yeahh... Was a bit dissapointed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-18*

time to sue

katsu does things really weirdly. the head of the cosplay department isn't in charge of the masquerade for example, which is also separate from hall cosplay. I get that katsu has a ton of entries so maybe splitting the cosplay department into hall and masquerade+everything else might work but
i lost my train of thought. what department even runs the ball. they have the king and queen thing but maybe main events is in charge.

OH right I know who's in charge of the masquerade next year, they're shadowing this year but they aren't allowed to do anything? they can't volunteer at all and can't be put on any other projects like what

*katsu this is why you're always desperate for gofers*

I've roomed with them a few times they're nice, just really bad at listening. they're a bit touchy with everyone and it made the girls in our room feel uncomfortable when they would randomly touch them (accidentally in most cases), and they were playing with rave lights when it was dark in the room and wouldn't stop after multiple requests (super painful because my eyes are awful and it takes up to a minute for my eyes to actually adjust when the lighting changes so aaaaaaahhhhh it burned), and the one guy was watching some video on his phone and somehow (forget how) started talking about the differences between soft and hardcore porn and how he'd watch softcore but not hardcore in a hotel room with other people
so they stopped getting invites to room with us after that. <:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274> 
but if you don't room with them they're fine people üëç  very party-oriented

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Rip

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

I'll give her some photos when I'm actually home?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Did she say "all the photos" or "a photo"

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

I told her I'd get her one or two.

But it's Sunday of the con.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

I feel really bad about the person who got ruined on tumblr (and then it crossed over to all other forms of social media because the cosplayer was famous, like 10s of thousands of fans). They were a paid photog who usually charged like $100 for a shoot, but they really liked the series that the cosplayer was cosplaying from so they agreed to a free shoot. at the crack of dawn for the best pictures. they literally got up and went outside at like 4/5 in the morning saturday of katsu for pics. 
the photog did photography as their real job too, and told the cosplayer straight up that since these were free pictures they would be put on the back burner while they worked on actual paid clients. plus these were images that took like 4-5 hours apiece to retouch. they had a 2 month turnaround just for paid convention clients.
they sent one or two previews after like 3 months or so to be a good sport and maintained contact. after a while cosplayer started throwing a fit anyway about not getting their pictures. üòø

biru pics should've been up by thursday come on smh

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

What part of that story involves a less than a day turn around?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

it's an analogy about how no one can be trusted and humans are terrifying

still waiting on my pyrrha pictures from last year's katsucon haha i don't think i'm ever getting those <:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

I named it "You fuckin wot m8"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

üòÇ

I saw that before

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*



this Jaune looks less like he wants to heal pyrrha and more like Gollum finding the one true ring again

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

oh noo did you guys have any issues with steelwolf

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Savage

And nah I don't think so?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

he was mostly just awkward with us

but I heard he kinda did the self invite thing with other people

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

is georgia that pyrrha on the bottom right
i like how the front jaune is totally ignoring her and reaching out of shot. probably towards another pyrrha but still

that's good he didn't cause much trouble for you guys but oh dear

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

He's trying not to steal.another man's pyrrha

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

and that everytime he met a new rwby he'd introduce himself and start saying that he knows somebody was out to get him for something and if he sees them he has to run

ye I'm holding her so other jaune reached for another pyrrha lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

wat
does he have a bounty

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Tom and I somehow avoided him? He asked us for directions at some point but that was it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

forget cinder, other jaunes gonna be in trouble if they touch yo pyrrha <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

_apparently not though_

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

You never fuck up the photo. No one does.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I wasn't sure cry would work as well as desperation, but I like it.

Well, don't like it, but anyone whose a sucker for a crying girl (not saying I am or anything) will feel the feels.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Yeeeee

I have a feeling desperation looks more appropriate but we shall seeeee

The crying one definitely works

_works pretty good_

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

pretty sure it was Zen.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

mystic mess has really nice formal attire

i'm guessing those two 707s didn't know each other beforehand because it would've been awesome if they did saeyoung and saeran

or is that what they're doing and one is using the other's glasses idk

boiiii

Oh I know dropped the ban hammer somewhere around here...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

bill photo question

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

photo answer.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

when taking photos with a background, is it better to take pictures on a background SIMILAR to your cosplay color or contrasting?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Grain of salt, I don't usually do more with backgrounds other than 'pretty enough' and 'good light'. Trying to change that, but Katsu was far too busy to experiment.

Background color changes the tone of the photo. I really wanted to use all that white marble on the upper floors for Weiss, because the white matches her. It also adds to her rich aura as well as the stark, lonely feeling.

I didn't originally want to do Monica's Salem against trees. I figured the bright green would go poorly with the spooky salem. (It works better with Chinese Dress version though, as she pointed out.) 

I'd say you want the background to complement the colors of the cosplay yes. Just don't want it to be too close, or you get no contrast between you and your background. You should have shadows or highlights to keep the background distinguished.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

it probably depend on character and feel/mood of whatever series they are from aswell

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Ah ok

what about with things like flowers or colored lights that are like... small splotches of color?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Just in the background? That sounds distracting. Pulls away from your subject.

If you have that, integrating it into the foreground makes sense. Like holding the flowers or something.

but every rule is meant to be broken.

Photography is as much an art form as sewing or worbla heat gunning.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

yeeee makes sense

theres that konkon photoshoot thats $40 ticket coming up

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

it was 40 bucks?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

but the location has really pretty bluebell fields and old colonial arcitecture and im like......... is it worth it............

theres an april one thats 40

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

$40?? jeeezzz

thats like the same price as some cons

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I believe they're renting out the place privately though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

ahhh

link?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

https://www.facebook.com/events/2000867056824926/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

yeah its the renting fee

https://www.flickr.com/photos/konkonamfox/sets/72157665012693591/

theres the photo gallery too

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

We need a organization point for events, there's like three day events already before Zenkai...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

shared google calendar?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

_i can make google doc_

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

https://padlet.com/willowlark/fbrlbgp45n5s I was thinking about using the pin board idea.

more free form.

Google calendar is hard to view concisely imo.

that's some nice castley stuff right there.... üëÄ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

thats some nice broken down buildings too üëÄ

but 40 ughghghhhh

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

mmm...

_shrugs_

I spent 40 bucks last week on a pocket knife so I didn't have to spend 5 dollars on shipping.

Who am I kidding, I'd spend it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

ooo i can add post it note

yeah i was assessing it for V4 Weiss

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

yup. Should all be editable.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

wasnt sure tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

snrk.

*Won't be as crowded as Katsu, that's for sure*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

does this paste board thing have an app?

im gonna end up putting it all in google calender anyway because i like to sbeable to SEE when the event it and  have a visual representation of time

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

yeah, looks like it has an android app.

https://padlet.com/support/account_loginmobile

If you make an account it'll credit your name to things Georgia. Also feel free to edit the stuff I put down.

Should let you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

i made an account

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Naaaaaaah Facebook.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

the blue bells would contrast yangs yellow really well

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Good thought, yeah...

Well, Konkon is apparently setting up changing tents and such.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

its a really neat location. it is a public park tho, on a normal day you could prob get in for cheap... of course then there will be regular people there. wonder if they will have food

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

the park might be private property, and then they'd complain about photo taking.

They said there'd be snacks?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

yeah the 40 must go to paying some type of park fee and then the rental of the little pavillion they have

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

https://www.lehighcounty.org/Departments/Parks-And-Recreation/Our-Parks/Lock-Ridge-Park

im trying to find normal entrance info

also the park will be open to the public during the photoshoot/meetup thing

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

but the area it's in is reserved.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

could be just pavilion rental and space for tents and things

"An 81 seat pavilion with a grill and restroom can be reserved. The outdoor area next to the furnace building can be reserved for weddings and events.  " I think thats what they are doing, so not the whole park or even the whole area with the buildings

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Some places are a real pain for these things.

If you can find a number for the parks dept, call it and ask.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

apparently they do pics here too: https://www.flickr.com/photos/konkonamfox/albums/72157690847037516

no event yet but greek stuff for pyrrha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

_little white gazebo MMMMM_

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

That'll cost money too.

Arboretums suck for that, I've looked at a few.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

have you seen this one before? cause that _little white grecian gazEBO HMMMM_

https://www.flickr.com/photos/konkonamfox/38025639805/in/album-72157690847037516/

LIKE THATS TOO GOOd

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

http://www.morrisarboretum.org/visit_photography.shtml

cosplay is def a gray area with this stuff but i figured id point it out for you

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

the photos ARE for personal use

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Definitely a grey area.

"Please, no changing outfits anywhere in the garden, even if you think the tree is big enough to hide you. It‚Äôs not."

They do allow tripods, could take that as a sign they're a little more chill.

I haven't looked at this one before.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

_gazebo_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

regular admission to lockridge is free btw. idk if they have any of these weird photo rules but it very much seems to be of the  type of place to not actually have anyone from the park there

there are guided tours on weekends apparently tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

"and to the left youll see... uh. is. that redhead dead. uh?"

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

In the event description it does say reserve the park and the pavilion.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

but it also say that it will be open to the public

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

the park is 59 acres.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

ye i know im just saying $40 is a little steepfor something you could go to for free

am i allowed to add to this pasteboard thing?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*



Course. it's a group board.

Apparently at every Konkon event you cant... turn down photos?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

huh

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Their (4 year old) FAQ.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

explains why they tried to split us up at konkon

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Did they?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

yea they kept trying to get the rwbys to go to other photags

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

üòë

That pisses me off.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

its like an orgy but in photography form

weird

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

ye. none of us really did tho lols

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I'd be pissed as hell if anyone tried to tell me I 'have to' photograph someone.

That's some entitled whiny children shit right there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

yea it was like when we'd be waiting during other "group" shots (like family shots or team shots)

they were like "there are other photographers"

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

"Better ones too"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

i thinkit was more of "you dont have to stand here and wait you can get other shots" but like were antisocial nerd what do u want

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Nah they totes though I was bad.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

well fuck dem den

also kogaracon is same day if that was a thing anyone wanted to do

wait. sakura sunday is like a 9 day event?

http://subarucherryblossom.org/event/sakurasunday/

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

It's run by the gardens I believe, so the gardens could run events all week yeah. <@!141729881779077121> you know more?

The main day is sunday though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

there 2 sundays tho üòÆ

8th and 15th

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

The big one is the 15th.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

oooo ok

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

back to Konkon for a second, it's 200 dollars to book the grounds or pavilion. If they're doing both, that's 400. If they're aiming for 10 attendees, 400/10 is 40.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Huh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

yea....

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

they did this last year, it's possible they're basing it off attendance last year.

I found the old event. 50+ people with a 25 dollar fee.

god bless unique photo. They always so knowledgable and good to me.

It's down right hilarious that the d500 has a slot for an newer memory card format called XQD, mostly because there are literally 3 of the cards in production.

all by Sony.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Nora's hammer is taller than her. RIP me

797 picks from Katsu.

Alot are very meh.

At least on a first pace.

Actually I don't even know.



FNKI is in the wrong collection apparently, fuck.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Binch Yang lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*



It's like, 20-30 was the magic number across shoots I guess.

Course there was a lot of not shooting, distractions, or *having to travel 15 minutes in foot traffic* involved.

(I'll also acknowledge God himself could have guided me to taking the perfect photos and I'd still think they're crap.)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

What is double dragons?

Assuming it's a rwby ship name

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

taiyang yang right

its family name

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Thanks Dave

Oooooo ok

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

yup, Taiyang Yang.

I use it despite the squick.

Partly cause the first time I did that was Hal and Georgia, and partly cause everything needs a short name.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Lmao that legit makes no sense cuz when Tom downloaded blueprints for Storm Flower the file was called double dragons üòµ

Somebody's messing up their shit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

Okay so I wrote short plans for Oberon and Leo
And Oberon is clearly insanely easier

Oberon has 10 parts to the costume

Leo has at least 17 and it's all sewing and edgeing ahhhhh

Also at least half of Oberons can be bought

Like the ears and antlers

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Hal and I got knocked out of the RWBY shipping contest?

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

O_o?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

huh

I could of sworn we had the lead

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Odd there are only three finalists.

It's setup for four.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Yea I saw that too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

And they're all bumblebee.....

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Yeeeeeeee

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

apparently we lost

55 to 50

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Ye



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

but they also left it up for a week not 48 hours

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Hmmmmmm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Thanks Sakura üòí

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Yea that's def gonna skew the results

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

wait nevermind

she says it was archived for a week

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

What
Rigged

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Wuuuut

I think just the fact that Its bumblebee played a big role....

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Ye what u think you doing with them straight pairings?

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Now some electromagnetism....

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Pretty sure bumblebee still would have been the final

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

True.



So 7 cosplays, 7 photographers.

Actually that probably pretty normal, though interesting.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

Ye unless you‚Äôve worked with the photog a lot before most people book a different photog for each shoot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Ooo Sakura just posted that there was a mistake? üòÆ

YAS

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-22*

<:lenny:395307171539189760> aight you arent ready for these thighs

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

newb question but can you bleach a wig?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

Mmmnn I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôve never seen someone successfully make a wig lighter. If it was real hair it might work but a synthetic one wouldn‚Äôt. Whatcha makin?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

Liliths hair is like red to blonde ombre üòÆ

bleashing the tips of a red wig would be easier then dying the top or a blonde wig butyea i dont think bleaching a wig is possible

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

Oooo. I see whatcha mean. 
I don‚Äôt know how much it would work but you could maybe try painting it? For nia/Selkie/neon/nowi and all them I used acrylic paints for the wig, although you won‚Äôt be able to wash it properly afterwards. I‚Äôve only really used it for light to dark colors but it worked fine going from orange to blue so maybe yellow or white could work. 
Mix some acrylic paint with a teensy bit of rubbing alcohol and a little bit of water and spread it on the wig (make sure to get as many strands of hair as possible) then dry it with a hair dryer. Since it‚Äôs on the end of the wig you can brush it (really super messy) to make it more wig-like otherwise the paint will kind of glob up and it‚Äôll be like a spike at the end of the wig. If you mess up it can mostly be washed off and redone. When you get it how you want it, attac with a ton of hairspray so the paint doesn‚Äôt come off on you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

üòÆ

you are a genius

looking on the internet, alot of people just forget about the blonde part and do red

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

why is finding a decent pic so difficult
aaaa

she the one on the right tho i've wanted to cosplay arisa for years too
and moa

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

üòÆ üòÆ do etttttttttttt

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

it's like homestuck character bingo except instead of 50 outfits of one character it's like 50 different characters ; u ;

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

i allready have 4 versions of Nora.... and a fitth for colosal at least RIP

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

this girl on tumblr was doing megido bingo but she stopped updating the chart before she did all the damara cosplays, like the sailor moon version and stuff



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

holllyyy damnnn

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

das cray!

i have like 3 versions of 2b i suspose? cuz i have a tshirt i made for her for rollarskating

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

are there a lot of official versions? homestuck has like 10 billion canon outfits for each character so people go crazy trying to collect 'em all but i haven't found another series that gets as crazy

o i found another bingo that was super intense but that was just someone who collected pictures of other cosplayers and didn't credit them boooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

ohhh 2b has her regualr, her heavy armor (which leanna is working on and its amazing) and then an outfit from anothjer nier game thats basically lingerie

A true friendship

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

*now that's a friend crush*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

You're not wrong probably

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

> post pictures
> suddenly she really wants to use this other photographer

you invented the term friend crush, I think that makes you an authority on them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Also true

And also that stupid yukinapoop is gonna win sakuras contest it looks like goddamn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

_actually hopes she likes the photos_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

she willll

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

ehhh....

There was some real standout shots. There were also some crap shots for private shoots.

speaking of...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

wut

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*



rip.

Bet he's going to be real motivated to get you your photos.

**Dave** - *2018-02-22*

Bill: *proceeds to delete said photos*

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

nah, I took literally two hall photos.

One was from a balcony above too, so it's not quality.

the other was chess lelouch.



So now that I have the ipad I'm going to give lightroom mobile editing a try.

They upgraded it in october to have alot of the utilities I'd use, so I'm won't need multiple passes.

hopefully.



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

NYOOMS IN

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-22*

"YE"
Nyooms out

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

they posted in both groups we put the rwby shoot in.

I love when Mark is all proud dad at us.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Sakuras dude got me photo proofs back

I like Pyrrha ones, not that crazy about Weiss tho





**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

Oh those shadows.

He have light equipment?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Yeee

~~I knew you'd want to compare yourself to the other people I shot with during the weekend bill~~

And my bud Claire got me a preview image too, I have high hopes for that one tho



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

When you said oh those shadows which pic are you referring too?

And are you saying they are good or bad?

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

Weiss. They're bad.

Could be unedited though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

Ok good lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

If he had light equipment that level of face shadow is inexcusable.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

Cuz that's what I was thinking

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

First Pyrrha is good. Second has wonky colors.

Easily fixed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Ya he used light equipment both times, I love the Pyrrha one but Weiss is weirdly shadowed

Yeah I think they're unedited

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

Don't write it off then. Post prod is pretty good.

(My comparing myself isn't a good thing btw.)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

Why u show person unedited anyway?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

To pick which ones I wanted edited

Some of them were kinda throwaways

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

Ooooo ok

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

Claire is the second Pyrrha one, she always makes the colors pop so Pyrrha should be good for her

Plus I got a dead one in that shoot that's gonna look baller

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

I can't wait to show you my (terrible) photos.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

I saw the one üòè

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Which one?

So you asked about colors complement with the background. <@!245270932602486784>



That‚Äôs what you don‚Äôt want. White highlights I‚Äôm the hair bleed into the white background.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-23*

She is one with all. Inner peace.

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

She in class, actually.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Would prob still look good with some color adjustment

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-23*

More saturation

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

_that‚Äôs post adjustment though. _

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Photoshop boiiiiii

Although selecting around her hair and headpiece would be a bitch

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

I don‚Äôt want to shop. It‚Äôs not fun, it‚Äôs cheating, time consuming, and is a useless skill when I want to get it right from the camera.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-23*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

But Chloe is cooler üòÇ no offense Georgia

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Nah, Max best girl.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Oh yea she is but like Chloe is *cooler*

But I love Kate Marsh forever

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Isn‚Äôt she the one you have to talk down?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Yeet

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Max is a photography girl. Adorablez. Much hug.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

That game let me live my dream of being in art school for 10 second

RIP my dreams

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-23*

Join us Jesssss

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Your in art school?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-23*

In cosplay LiS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Yaaaas

Should prob finish the game

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Snrk. Tom can cosplay the straight love interest you‚Äôre supposed to ignore.

As a fellow dopey nerd boy I liked him.

Whatever his name was.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

I liked him too üòÇ

Surprise surprise

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

_or if he gets his Adam on, he could be creeper teacher. _

Teacher > tornado best villain.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

YAS

Omg I thought he was so sexy and then....

Creepy but good looking dudes in glasses? Sign me the fuck up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-23*

WARREN he was a good noodle

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

That was his name.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Yes Warren! I liked him

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Literally every time they trolled you with the ‚Äúexplain to warren‚Äù option I seethed.

Who the fuck else would I talk to about magic time powers? The ex druggie rocker girl, or the *scifi nerd*?

Max was cute but very dumb sometimes.

Also Jess you have problems.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

Only in fiction IRL I like good boy nerds who are cute

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Granted, I did *not* expect the twist at the end of volume 4 and 5 wasn‚Äôt out when I played it.

So the adult fear was real.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Lol what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-23*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-23*

Saturday nightttt

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Which in this case, and usually is when I use the term, is that teacher guy at the cliffhanger was super rapey.

So adult fear.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Ohhhh yea he creepy AF

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

So that was a nasty cliffhanger.

_then the budget went dry and the tornado became the main villain but_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

I really should finish that game... And then there's the new one too

Wonder if its any good

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

After episode 5 I‚Äôm good. Plus Max was who was interesting to me, not Chloe.

Editing via iPad is slower, cause big thumb and tiny slider, and lacks virtual copies/adjust,met history. But it‚Äôs otherwise okay.

Have to compare what I‚Äôve done to how it looks on a pc though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-23*

thaT PHOTO OF THE MYSTIC MESS COSPLAY one of you posted here a few days ago from katsu of your friend
it was both of them omg. they were cosplaying a picture that came with the mint eye special believer package the company sold. bless.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-23*

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Well that's surprising. I got one of dem like storms from Zeikani this morning, and Flora messaged me about an in-and-out cosplay shoot with Steven outside of a con.

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Well I talked to Zeikani friday morning at Katsu.

Which went surprisingly well given we spoke for 10 minutes at Next, and that's it.

Flora is surprising tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Oh, This new folder structure idea is going to make backups so much easier...

year->quarter->"whatever the shoot was"

I can literally back up quarterly.

I should really delete more photos...

I'm really bad about deleting the bad ones when I pick the good ones, and I leave all the meh ones there in the folder...

OOPS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

LMFAO

Does she not know your name?

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*



*It's right there*

Now she mentioned my name, okay.

aaaaaah, okay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Omg there are legit 5 people in that group yes?

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

It's a copy pasta.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

Ooooo ok thank God

At least she redeemed herself

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-23*

*puts down pitchfork and torch*

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

nah, I wasn't really bothered... more amused.

Which then I wonder why binch Yang bothered me so much.



I need a better system for backups.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-23*

lol

apple

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

it's more the 41k photos.

Sakura has paid 250 dollars for a single shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

dammmnnn

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

better start collecting 250 a shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

üí∏

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

No one would pay that for my work tbh.

There's heavy edits and on location shooting for what the 250 person charges.

I don't know what I could get away charging if I wanted to. Only useful part of that would be using it as a indicator of skill.

*I suppose money would be nice but*

That's what I work in NYC for.

**Dave** - *2018-02-23*

Thought your fee was paid in drinks

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Ha.

Everyone I shoot for is a minor.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-23*

Sskura isn't

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Didn‚Äôt tip though.

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Marisa gave me a dollar like I was a stripper once. Binch Yang gave me 5. Hal Georgia and Mak bought dinner after Princeton I believe. Definitely some part of it.

And Tom and Jess bought dinner Sunday. (Oh my god Katsu wasn‚Äôt even a week ago)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-23*

this time last week i was making 4:20 jokes at the rwby shoot LOL

Boy that had been going on foreverrrrr. (I have no idea why Facebook is only showing to me now though)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

DUDE I SCREENSHOTTED THE SAME THING AND WAS GONNA POST IT LITERALLY NOW
biru get outta my head

who are the people in the pictures on the left

they aren't even in rwby cosplay, weird that they'd show up in your tagged posts

cassie had an entire animal crossing village cosplay group at katsu
yo. i am jealous. like not just isabelle/the re-tail couple/blathers and his daughter/KK but also katrina and a bunch of random villagers

urge to cosplay all 101 harvest sprites intensifies

this could be us and like 93 other people but y'all playin'

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Sleepy!Hal was like "we gots to be Facebook official" and I was like oh yeah Facebook

I was never really keen on other people getting involved in my personal business BUT eh it's whatever

Facebook Official‚Ñ¢ means it's real

Also Lainey (aka, Erik crush?) is 19 whoaoa



Like whoa I'm 19

We're both babies

_time to befriend_

I noticed this last night because Erik had a stream and she and Rebecca were the only two there lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

kids gotta stick together üë≠

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Putting on there may dissuade some people from having an interest. Can't hurt.

Besides, you have it in your Instagram bio.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

i feel like that would attract people people than dissuade them üò±

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah the Instagram bio is the more important one LOL

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

OH relationship status, not age. i knew that.

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah status.

You've been short on pda this week (I guess cause he sick poor Haphlem) so you gotta anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah half my work is sick too like ahhhhhhh contagion

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Actually I packed my fallout pj pants for tonight oops

I'm on another fallout kick now that I'm gonna finish my vault suit



I really like how my armor looks here?

But..... why......

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

maybe there ar mor spots the light hits it, reflecting its neatness

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Oh u right

Also you know how I spent a billion years making a new shield



In this picture it flew back into the lake

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

ye how that gooooooooooooooooooooooooooh nice

OH NO

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

And it floated and didn't get damaged

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

cosplay kami-sama watching over u

i saw an aang cosplayer fall into that water once i felt bad for them but they took it like a pro and turned it into a 'katara-getting-mad-at-aang' picture

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Omg that's great

Yeah if you fall in, might as well use it

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

But ye much happy with new shield



Here is comparison

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

ahh screen shotted the same thing last night

Glad we're all on that wavelength

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

It took so long cause somebody was like "I don't like facebook official"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

The hard drive backup is killing Lightroom.

Tom, do you not care katsu/mag?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

I don't to be honest, I've never been to magfest

So I can't vote

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Neither have I. It has one of the big perks of Katsu though, the Gaylord location. Just less people.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

I am pretty sure non of us have been to magfest

Also traditionally, magfest actually has a higher attendance rate

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I can ask flora actually, she's a long time mag fest attendee.

First time Katsu this year as well.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

Ashely said magfest wasn't as bad as katsu

I'm just guessing katsu has an insane amount if lobbiers

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Which makes sense, given the reputation of Katsu as cosplay con.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Like in 2016 magfest had over 20k 
Katsu only had 17k

Also people at magfest don't like non video game cosplayers from what I've heard 
Like they're kinda looked down on cause it's not appropriate cosplay

Looking at the data, magfest has maxed out its attendance every year since 2016

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

It's ok there's a rwby video game üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

true.



Asked Flora too.

Any other questions worth asking her?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

I honestly don't care which we go too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Lol magfest can't blow up any more

It's maxed out its attendance, so the only way it'll blow up is if people lobby con it more

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

which after this overpacked katsu...

others might have the same idea.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Tbh I'm pretty sure katsus actual paid for attendance is still gonna be less than magfests

Because so many people lobby con it

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

It might be. Personally I care about how many people are in the atrium at the same time, cause it's impossible to move let alone photograph.

Lobby conners add to that number.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah 
Even if magfest has a larger number of people, most of them are doing events and stuff, so you don't end up with an overstuffed atrium

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

which gets better access to the atrium for photos.

Tom can play in the tourney's too, actually. might be cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

maaaaaybe? Gifs are garbage so...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Ye gifs suck buts, but it's still super cute

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

The images are cut in half size wise, so yeah, things will look funky.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

No pixelated on my phone

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Oooo ok maybe is just me then

Oh yea it looks better on Tom's phone

He gets like the tiniest of smiles üòÇ

Barely noticeable. And he wonders why I wanted him to be Ren so bad...

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

*Cause Ren has long hair?*

All he's missing is glasses *ohwait* henceforward.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

I did Weiss yesterday, but then I went over it again in an attempt to make it less... blegh.

Some of JNPR yesterday.

Which is 31+24, plus the 25 Renora and now the 10 Quarters.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Now to attempt auto tone my way through Chameleon's photos.

cause idgaf.

I *cannot* explain what it was about her that just turned me off to her though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Uh asking for photos so much probably

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

It was only twice?

But I'd like to *think* I'm not that intolerant of some stupid questions.

but of course, her photos come out really well.

some anyway.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-25*

It's not surprising. Both cause you a good cosplayer, and because photographer accounts don't get too much attention. (Except from weirdos like Wezrez cosplay.)

Though I can't imagine you having thousands of followers. Like, my Jess? Instagram famous?

Blows my mind.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

omg that terrifying

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

~~drags jess into instagram fame with me~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Oh, cause it's pure suffering for you kiddo.

üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

whaaaat

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Drags implies negativity. You like the fame. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Oh boi, two Instagram famous people. Just what we needed.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

Drag can‚Äôt be negative if it‚Äôs the first letters in dragon

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Oh hush you.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

good morning starshine

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I'd probably be a Wally if I got 2k followers.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

be a wally?

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I haven't met her though, but it sounds about right. I wouldn't care 90% of the time and if it brought attention to me at a con I'd be like "ugh, this is annoying god."

Georgia's Instagram famous friend who hates being famous.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

-switches to business profile to gain the power of insights -

Huh, my followers are still quite predominantly female

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

üòè

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

Don't give me that look

Also apparently 4% of my followers are from England

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

Instagrams is still mostly female in general too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

Fair

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

how do you know where followers are from :0

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

If you switch to a business profile

You can get insights on your followers

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

ooooooooooooooooooooo you're a legit company now omg

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

Nah 
I switched back to personal

Business profile be funky and ruins your outreach a little

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

What are the odds Gen invited me to her birthday/coming home party because she things Georgia, Hal and I are a classic Friend Trio ‚Ñ¢ ? You know the kind, the three friends who are always together (in this context at cons). Usually 1 girl. Usually ends up with two pairing off.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

Are you confessing an undying love for Hal

Also should I block this person



**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

If you want to.

It's a random internet account, nothing to feel bad over.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

I can‚Äôt reciprocate their feelings especially when their account is private and they comment that on everything I upload

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

So block them then.

I'm not even suggesting anymore, just do it ffs.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

I will but a new mystic mess chat room opened and it‚Äôs so golden it‚Äôs the best chat in a while

Priorities this is hilarious

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Marisa you husbando fiend.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

Yee

Also yee block em

Too creep

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

‚ÄúWhy is that foreigner chick hunched over and cracking up. Should we call the cops.‚Äù - everyone on the train probably

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

probably

:3

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

das a kawaii pic

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

but it's bad.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

YE saw that

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

We don't ship him and her.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

RIP rebecca

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

She new bitch.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

*me, halfway to reaching out my hand whispering "new friend"* ... not friend?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

ooo

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I mean, I'mma ship Rebecca and Erik because unrequited crushes are a soft spot for me, but nothing wrong with Lanie.

afaik.

I only use bitch in the 'side bitch, old bitch, new bitch' meme sense.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

i ship them thou

so

üòõ

i ship erik rebecca and erik and lainy, that way everyone can be happy

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

It'd be the least sinful threesome I've ever seen.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

hell while im at it ill shiip rebecca and lainy too

why not

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

ooo yea

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

OT3

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

~~erik has enough height to go around~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

you know what they say about tall boys

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-27*

*what do they say OoO*

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I can't ship the threesome. It'd kill me to say "Yeah, I'd date but all my friends are either gay, in a happy relationship, or *in a threesome thing*."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

*oh you know*

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

When do we ask Erik if it's a thing.

üí°

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

sarahahahhahaha?

but i aint doin it

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*



Using a callback. My writing style disguised enough?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

OMG thats u?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-27*

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Words have immense power. Using them correctly can completely change what's said.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

it makes sense now, erik doesn't like the girls obviously in love with him cuz hes a virgo

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

So many asks too.

Damn.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

thirsty peeps

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

for rwby watch everybody says jaune is mercy 
but like 
i can't agree with that >.>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

its only cause the heal-y thing

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

1. Jaune is a tank healer, 
2. Jaune has heal-y hands
3. His actual semblance is auramanipulation

so like

Moira is a better fit

cause her healing is like life force manipulation (ie aura)

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Moira didn't exist at the start of Rwbywatch discussions so...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

I know

but like it makes so much more senseeee

moira is tanky

Moira has Heal-y hands

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

moira is scary tho and jaune is sweet lol

perosnality wise at least

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

and Moira is just busted in the meta rn.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

i don't see how thats relevant bill üòÆ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

nerf jaune 2018

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

that's why Moira is more tanky?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

in the same vein, all these rwby famous cosplayers are doing overwatchxrwby au cosplays

and im like.......... i feel like people expect me to be in this group but i have yet to find a character/outfit i really care to do

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

moira is more tanky cause she can heal herself and she has a good disengage

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

do what you want to do.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

unless they change her abilities that won't change

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

who cares what people expect silly?

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

üîº

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

yeah actually i had a pretty swanky idea for saturday rtx already but im still batting it around and would need hals help

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

I want to do rwbywatch but I don't like how they mixed the characters I like

bae whats the satday idea

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

is there like a lost of these? or its just people headcanons? the only one ive seen is Nora/Reinhardt

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

Side note:
Widow Weiss? why????

nothing about widow and weiss are similar???

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

the only thing i can see is like the cold personality thing? but thats a stretch

cuz widow is dead inside and weiss is just... well weiss

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Is Ruby tracer?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

tom and i said ren was tracer the other day XD

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

i think so

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I'm sure Ruby is tracer, and by the law of "everyone ships white rose" Weiss had to be widow so there could be sexual tension between them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

cuz pistols and creates distractions  XD but ruby is more tracer like in personalty obviously

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

In the first trailer that took off after all.

So the decision was probably made so they could ship even in the AU.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

i mean what are they based on? weapons or personalities?

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I haven't seen too much rwbywatch.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

they have no consistent metric for basis

just very strong feelings for certain characters

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

Ah ok

me thinking: *would blake be reaper?*

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Wut?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-28*

tfw your picture is profile pic worthy.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

i got tagged for stopdropandselfie by jennyplays along with two other people 
and she collectively referred to us as "babes"
while i understand this is just her way of referring to people, and I know she knows morninggmist 
having 'babes' said in reference to myself feels weird

weirder than the first time david called me dad outside of taiyang cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

It's not that far from bae.

just run with it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

probably just means you good looking

not like babes as a pet name but babes as in "pretty person"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

i kno its not as a pet name lol 
it just feels 
Weird

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

hey babe

how do you feel about switching to using babe instead of bae

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

I never thought I'd prefer the bae thing over something else.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

Bill thinks they're basically the same

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

they're both terrible imo, but at least I'm used to the bae.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

yeah bill

what should we use

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Figure it would depend on the girl. Hopefully something unique to her and I.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

its not like georgia's name gives itself to pet names 
so what standard non-name related pet name should we use lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

yea but them you come up with something unique and everyone things your both just insane XD

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

tbh we didn't think we'd actually use bae

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

*am I not insane?*

I know. Tis why I don't normally say anything.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

Its derivative of my friends calling her my weeabae

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

also it takes a while to get something unigue

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

since we weren't boyfriend and girlfriend

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

Nora and Raven are my comfy cosplays. Lilith was super comfy but tattoos

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

I figured pants would be comfy.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

what would I know.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

yea but what about... not wearing any pants

XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

*That sounds like what Ethan wants*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

the right dress or skirt is super comfy its usually the shoes that make them uncomfy

wear your lest sexy cosplay just to spite him

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

YESSSS

*kind of doesn't want to hang out near ethans booth so he doesn't get another "booth babe" unintentionally*

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

lmao for the compliment

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

oh.

*how's that self confidence thing feel? nice?*

*Probably like a hot tub*

Someone NEEDS to take these italic comments away from me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

like i said the bad thing and i was "WOW I should not say bad things about myself"

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

it's perfect for expressing my dry and yes, snarky humor.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

but i used to be alike "all the bad things all the time"

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

üòÆ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-28*

Omg yes

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*



I know some~~thing~~one you can do

It's... Erik.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

Oh really

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

Lmao I'm sure she'd love too üòè

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Poor girl.

Oh gee, now Leanna is getting into boudoir.

Boudoir: that hip new thing all the youngsters are doing. Back in my day it was weed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

guys im thinking about doing boudoir

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

jess no
make tom do it

you'll feel so much more satisfied

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

YES you are so smart hal

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

that's not how you do it, you post an instagram poll which lets ~~perverts~~ people on the internet decide for you!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

im sure those 25 family member i have on insta will love it

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I'm kinda tempted.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-01*

I mean sounds neet

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

it's a bit expensive, but they are offering rental lenses free...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

but this is just to take pics of wolves right?

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

There's a lecture the friday before it too.

You very likely have to pay the conservatory to go where this tour takes you. There's a paid photography thing for lakota too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

what i mean is, not cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I post photography stuff to cosplay or conventions because why would I make a photography channel just for me?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

lol im not scolding you for using wrong channel XD just getting clarification

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

yes, there's no cosplay involved.

Nor is there any real interest for any of you, as it's a photographer thing.

*though with my luck it'll be an event of furries*

I bought a ticket though.

Gotta remember the old grad school mantra.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

id do it if it were cheaper XD

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

it's geared for photographers, really is.

If we were to go see wolves lakota is the better choice.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

YE

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

Guyssss

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ye?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

Guess who messaged me asking about Ethan



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

OH SHIT

"ye he hunting for new frens"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

i'm not sure how to respond

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

yea i wouldnt know either

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

"that dark hacks guy"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

I'm just gonna clarify its ethan first for now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

does tyler know ethan?

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I don't think Tyler would... really care.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

i think they've met

<@!245270932602486784>  I may end up sliding tyler your way if he hasn't messaged you about it yet

((hopefully she sees this before that happens))

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I'm starting to think I'd get along better with Tyler than Brandon, the more I see the two of them.

tangentially.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

I think tyler is easier to get along with?
not in that he's a better person or something, but in that he's more of a people person than brandon

I'm not sure what or how much to explain to tyler

partially because like

I don't know where ethan stands on me in particular, and how he stands with the rest of you as well

like I know he wants to maybe still be friends with yall(?)

like if he's trying to befriend tylers group, and finds out tyler asked me about it, and they decide nah for whatever reason, with me probably being irrelevant 
I feel like he'd blame me the same way casey blames georgia for Ethan and her break up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

yea, he seems to want to be friends with us :/   wait does he legit  blame georgia for the break up? the one he wanted?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

no he doesn't

remember casey blamed georgia for it

bill pls help me figure out what to tell tyler

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

oh sorry read that wrong

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

he's already said yes that guy when I asked if he meant ethan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

yea he might be like "oh i coulda been friends with tyler and peeps but hal told them not too"

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

So it's fair to be hesitant about gossiping. We gossip a lot here, but we're both a very tight knit group and know to keep things to ourselves. I don't bring people into my circles who create drama after all. (Though Georgia gets wrapped up in far too much for my liking, but it's not her fault.)
You don't know what is a secret with Ethan, and what he'd be willing to divulge to delaware group. (Odd saying that, given within hours of meeting him he told me about being in prison.) You also don't know where he stands on you overall, because he hasn't been your biggest fan (so I'm told by you and Georgia).

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

my favorite thing he's apparently said about me will always be

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

maybe just be like "he recently had a falling out and id trying to branch out to new people?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

that I peacock to much

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I think I would ask Tyler if "it's a problem, or anything like that?" to find out if Tyler's opinions on the thing.

If Tyler is bothered by him, give some noncommittal response as to not start drama. Let him talk to Ethan himself.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

so like 
"is there a problem or something?"

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

If Tyler is concerned as a potential new friend, it's okay to state facts like 'he's having a hard time socially right now, I imagine he just wants to branch out a bit.'.

little too confrontation to say it exactly like that.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

yeah i felt that

not sure how to put it exactly without sounding confrontational

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

You want to to present curiosity to Tyler.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

"did something happen, or are ya just asking cause its sudden?"

hmm i don't like the wording on that one

how about

"Is he just messaging y'all a bunch or..?"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ye be casual bout it lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

That'd work.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

ooo fun

now tylers typing and stoppping repeatedly instead of me lol

the intricacies of chatting through instagram dms about other people



et boom

added bonus 
"When I first met him I was not a big fan of him and my gut is usually right"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

i was gonna say it may have something to do with meg :/

thats not surprising at all

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

yeah I figured he'd been bothering meg

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Well I get where he's coming from. Tyler. He's trying to keep this as dramaless as possible. You aren't in the best spot to be dishing on Ethan though. Especially given you'll be seeing him tomorrow.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

yeahhhh

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

That said, the "noncommittal option" doesn't feel right anymore because he's harassing people.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

<@!245270932602486784>  get in here we got some stuff for you

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

You're safe to talk about what's happened with Georgia (I assume, Georgia can of course veto that!). Keep it related to you and Georgia, and facts.

This way Ethan can't say you swayed Tyler's opinion of him.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

I think I'm gonna just be like "ok.. yeah thats not ok" to start

and give the bae some time to catch up since I believe she's just arisen and starting to read up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

*deports ethan back to texas*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*



next message said

"And I not really up to date on his current situation but I thought he had a girlfriend. so I'm confused as to why this is happening"

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

That's a hook to share about Casey.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

HENLO I HAVE FINALLY READ THE BACKLOG

anyways

its public knowledge that he and casey broke up so

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

oh good he isn't salty about it being shared anymore?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

he shouldnt be?

i have notifications on insta one sec

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Georgia can talk a little more freely. She's been a "victim" of creepy Ethan and isn't on thin ice with the guy socially.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

nope no message from tyler

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

LOL "i broke up with my gf but no one can know"

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

To be fair, Katy didn't publicize her and Matts breakup.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i mean he should tell people

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

publicize and people can know are 2 different things

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

hes not in the market for a new GF but

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Well, he's trying to be apparently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

prob not for gf....

just for hookups

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

And safety Tyler ain't having that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

Good Guy Tyler‚Ñ¢

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I recall something Ethan said when we talked him through the break up: "befriend the guy friends first and the girl won't expect it when you hit her up"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

bae whats the last thing tyler said

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

what a D-bag XD

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

georgia I'm claling you into a group chat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

(gosh it feels so good for the hard midterms to be over so now i can be active again)

okie dokey

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*



they sent in reverse order

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

all good

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Yeah, just keep your opinions tame. Don't bash Ethan and you're set.

And clue is in after the fact.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

~~ain't looking for a girlfriend but probably wants a hook up~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

^

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

also georgia said towards the end of the explanation (will screen shot in a second)

that he's probably looking for "nerds who know how to socialize" like him

and if the fact that tyler messaged me about this tells me anything  
Ethan is not a nerd who knows how to socialize

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ethan prob thinks that anyone who doesnt socialize the way he does is "A sheltered social outcast special snowflake"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

MMM JESS HITTING IT RIGHT ON THE HEAD

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

YEET

read dude bros like a book

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-01*

Well you have my brother as a perfect example >w>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

when in reality its just that not everyone is loud and outgoing as he is

YUP

*thinks again about the irony of ethan calling hal peacocky*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

/pleasantly surprised about how concerned and mature tyler is considering most of my interactions with him have been cake-related

you go tyler

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

CAKE?!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

damn ethans shooting his business in the foot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

<:rip_tombstone:369476083248267274>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

megs uncomfortable as a model too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

üò¶

Ethan: Making Pyrrha cosplayers uncomfortable since 2017 üëå  probably earlier

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

can confirm meg was uncomfortable with the contract he wanted her to sign

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

yupppp

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-01*

:////

Yeah Tyler is being super adult, nice to see

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

what a bro üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

"get you a man that can do both" *puts a screenshot of the conversation next to the screenshot of him drinking from the banana flask*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

"/pleasantly surprised about how concerned and mature tyler is considering most of my interactions with him have been cake-related
2
you go tyler"

QOTD

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

*adds safety tyler to list of dudes can trust*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

time to screenshot the whole conversation for posterity

and done

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

Hal getting receipts

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

you kno it

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Yeah, Tyler watching out for the girls in his group is good to see.

I always though he would though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i mean i assumed he would

but its nice to see in practice too

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Mm.

Now to deal with tomorrow and distance ourselves from Ethan.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

seeing as the last time i saw tyler and megathey were having a dis competition at each other ü§£

*wants to see frens*

*doesnt want to see ethan*

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

What did Tyler come to as a conclusion?

I dunno Jess, if the 5 of us are being all tight knit it'll make it harder for him to engage.

Superior numbers.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

If I'm there he might disengage :p

btw guys an Ethan talk is in progress

as in georgia is in the process of talking to ethan due to meg saying no to the contract officially

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Oh of course.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

but im too niiiceee ill just talk to him

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

HA

HA HA HA

HAH HA HAH AHAHAA

ETHAN ASKS IF I WANNA MODEL AGAIN

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

WHTTT??

why?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

he has no models now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

why does he thins thats something ud wanna do

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

Lol

he's silly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

yeah i said no official business modelling

ill give him a couple weiss weapon photos if he wants to post a showcase of my mehmaymeh

but like, thats it

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Good answer.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-01*

yeeet

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Can't wait to point out tomorrow "you don't actually need models" when he bitches tomorrow.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

"Jess u wanna model for me?"

"at least till i get someone with more cosfame"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

oop too real

but yeah i like the work on mehmaymeh so thats fine he can post a couple of my pics to the business to showcase the weapon

and ill still tell people where i got it from because credit is deserved where its due

but official modelling? nahhhhhhhhhhhh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

f dat

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Unofficial too.

Imo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i mean technically by reposting my photos i am modelling the weapons

but not being a model

if that makes sense

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Ethan's become a real pain personally and I'm starting to worry.

That's not modeling, it's promoting.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

üòµ

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Personally as in socially versus business.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

oh ethan..... y r u leik dis

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

ya know one thing to thank ethan for

his extremely forced attempt/approach to befriending the Meg/ty group

has probably brought us closer to them

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

well, you guys. üòõ

So where did Tyler end up?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

in what sense

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

he just gathering info or he gunna do something.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

I think meg telling ethan no

and ethan deciding he doesn't like her anymore because of it

solved things?

not sure

if he does something georgia will get a call tho

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

which is less than ideal as well...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

*starts to suspect that tyler was the one who messaged steelwolf*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

the threat?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

yes? i think

the one that was like "youre creepy you gotta tone it down" or whatever

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

nah I asked him about it

it aint him

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ooo ok

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

or might not want to admit to it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

he thinks its funny steelwolf runs away from him

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

*some people are like that, JESS*.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

he probably would admit it to it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

like what? üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

but he *doesn't* like drama. Letting it remain anonymous lets the message be the only thing to linger. Can't be dramatic about someone you don't know.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

wait buy y u say some people are like that to me?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

Nah he's the type to confront steelwolf in person

like he has before

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I'm teasing you about how I didn't want to admit to messaging Ethan.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

OHHH lmao

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

So delaware is done with him...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

*deports ethan back to texas*

*again*

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

well that's your opinion, what about the rest of the circle here?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

na i mean ill still deal with him if other people want to i just wouldnt go out of my way

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

*but do other people want to?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

That's a question for said other people. Why am I beating around the bush, I want to know what Georgia's thinking.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

It was my way of "bumping the question"

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

yeah, well, subtly sucks sometimes. 

I mean, I don't like how he treated Georgia nor that he's now harassing Meg. I wasn't ever that close to him, and my usual response to someone wronging my people is to let them disappear from my life. (I'm kinda boring, so if I stop contacting people historically they forget about me and therefore mine. ^^;;)

But that won't work here, cause Georgia is the opposite.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

Uhmmmm

Good question

Idk ethan isn't a mean guy he's just

He never considers that sometimes he can be wrong?

I'll still be his friend probably

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

hes kinda.... narcissistic

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I don't mind him in doses, it's just... why does he *continue* to make trouble even when he's not around.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i got more photos back from katsu

one photographer did a little red tint to all my pyrrha photos and idk how it makes me feel

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

So... it's either Claire or awkward guy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

claire

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

what the poop is it uploading

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Jpaden is the other? Guessing since it looks like Sakura connected him with David too.

nope.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*



there we go

yeah

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

eh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i mean _dat wind tho_

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

you can tell it was shot at night, but that it still looks good is impressive.

the red tint makes sense. I know exactly why she did it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

oh no it wasnt night

it was like 3 pm

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

then I have no idea why it's so grainy.

unless it was a stylistic choice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

maybe???

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

that's odd.

really odd.

The red tint still makes sense though. Overcast sky tends to brighten up a photo and the contrast is distracting. I'm seeing it in Destiny shoot.

They all like this?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

most are

so the red is to fix the white sky?



the file is too big to send but this one isnt

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/7391840/android/sticker.png;compress=true

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i like that one some of the most tbh

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

It's a different composition.

The one center on the right of the zoomed photo also looks like it has a really good composition.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

kinda wishing she used a slightly different shade of red, but if definitely creates a mood

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

has a fall feel to it.

I like the concept, just like, *really* twisted photo.

more than I thought it was.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

I like your face in that one

i mean i always like your face üòõ but there somthing about the look üëå

what was it marisa said the otherr day? "tilt the camera 45 degrees, congrats now you are photographer"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-01*

THE OUTSTRETCHED HAND POSE
COMBINED WITH THE TILTED CAMERA FOR ABSOLUTE PERFECTION

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

That pose is super annoying because the hand is always out of focus tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

unless u focus the hand and not da face

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Then the face is out of focus.

Which is a crime against god.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

well i suppose so i mean unless you were doing a like "take my hand" thingy, then i think it would be ok

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

I can't say I'm a fan of so much empty space in the photo



Like whoa so much wall

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

OMG

thats good for business card

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

Truuuuue I guesss

My favorite is probably this one



Tho there's also SO MUCH SKY there



I cropped it for posting to Insta tomorrow

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ooo i liek that

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

What's the dimensions on those two?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

Uhhh unknown

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

You can check.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

right click on image> properties

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Also this is still midday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

I'm on mobile how do

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

oooo ummmm idk lol

meybe billy know

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

No idea on mobile.

Still midday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

3-4 was the shoot ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

app. 3:27

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

She edited the sky to look like that.

It looks good but I have mixed feelings.

As an art-tist.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*



i mean thats kind of the things with art there are no rules ü§∑  just preferences

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

Lmao that pic

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

XD

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

I know it's personal preference.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

I look so smol in that pic

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

me: dat our pyrhha!?
tom: ye das her

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

*opens the window and yells afina*

*pyrrha on the stairs immediately whips around*

**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

So... it's 5 to 10 inches by us...

But you know....

If we get more more snow that sticks....

Weiss in the snow shoot?

<@!245270932602486784> üòÅ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

JAB SNIPED A PHOTO OF ME THAT LOOKS SO WEISS



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

The anime eye sparkle

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

<@245270932602486784>  sharing the love again, pushing me to 250 üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Yeeet

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

<@!245270932602486784> I'mma challenge Hal being the highlight of your weekend. üòé

Okay, not really, but I can give you something to amuse yourself with at lunch break.

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/personal/2018/03/03/Destiny.html

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

WHEEZES THANK YOU LET ME LOOK NOW

Oh my god I'm gonna marry this photo



ITS SO INRENSE I üòç

I MEAN LOVE IT BHT THAT WORKS TOO



Lmao yaaaaas

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

You and Ginny are are a great pair.

Shoot with her more.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

I gotta do Weiss so she can stab me through the abdomen

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Stap.

The ones where she was choking you I looked at full resolution your face and I was like "gotta punch whoever made you look like that" but then I remembered Ginny is woman and you're acting.

These sads are killing me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

üòèüòèüòè

I live for the sass

I mean sads but that works

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Don't you sass me now.

The vignetting deals with the bright water/clouds and makes it more moody.

Works I think.



Ginny is making such a goofy face in this photo but then I was like... Georgia looks good so?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Thank

My smol baby face

Fierce baby faced Pyrrha

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Na, fierce.

Very badass.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Ok but I am in love with the first one



_im gonna print it out and put it everywhere_

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

I like Ginny's expression in a different one like that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

O rly

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Ye, the ones where she looks at the camera.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*



That one?

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*



Option A is instagrams fault

Option B is my fault

Remember the weird guy posting on Zenkai about opening rates, that said he wanted to shoot with me

Voted option B

*mentally notes for zenkai*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

Well he a dick

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Oops reiley voted B also what

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*



Interesting explanation

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Photographers aren't exactly popular.

Especially in cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

I mean at the end of the day it's your intagram, post what you want!

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

It's true what you post affects things though.

One of the pros I talked to on that photo walk said behind the scenes is very important.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

Oooo are you talkin‚Äô with deuce

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Because you can forget what the person is like behind the content.

Deuce?

Also inb4 this guy says you need new content and is like "I can hook you up with it. You and me it'll be great. That photographer you usually shoot with? Trash. I gotchu covered girl"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

Or maybe that‚Äôs someone else with a name similar to deuce‚Äôs
Deuce is very well know among con staff he runs the AMV contest for a bunch of east coast cons and does photography. Idk if that‚Äôs him or not though.

YEAH I looked it up that‚Äôs deuce. I don‚Äôt know him much personally but he isn‚Äôt awful.

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

I dunno. He posted this petty thing on one of the groups bitching about people complaining about his prices.

I dunno him though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

Perhaps time has made him crotchety. But it is kind of bad form to complain about prices. Just don‚Äôt book the photog if they expensive

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Mm. If you say he ain't a dick, I've never met him and I'll give it you.

It IS weird for a photographer to request a cosplayer.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

Outgoing and I think an older person since most long term staff are older (30+). Old weebs have a totally different mindset to young weeb. Most cons are run by people age 40-50+. Crazy. 
He comes off as pushy but think of him like a game show host seeing that‚Äôs most of his job at cons. Again I don‚Äôt know him too well but he‚Äôs one of the more social and better known staff members.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Oh is he like, old?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

I thiiiiiiink so. I‚Äôm bad with ages. But he‚Äôs been staffing cons since 2011. 
Which now I realize is around the same time I‚Äôve been staffing bUT he‚Äôs definitely older than me. 2011 he was a department head so maybe he‚Äôs been staffing longer than that because you can‚Äôt just jump to department head.

So many instagrams doing the coffee thing now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

Yeeeet it's all about the coffees and boudoirs these days

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

Freaky

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

I'm wondering what got Leanna into boudoir.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

I bet it was the coffee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

üòÇ

Idk ü§î maybe she just thought it would be fun also her and her bf aren't a thing anymore so maybe she always wanted to and just couldn't before cuz of him

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

But now she quote ace as fuck unquote

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

Same

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Hmm true.... Dunno ü§∑

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

Maybe it‚Äôs for the aesthetic

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Yea that's what I was thinking

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Does that actually mean anything.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

ya it‚Äôs For the Aesthetic‚Ñ¢

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Like dressing sexy for the aesthetic and for pics doesn't mean you nessesarily want to have sex

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Sure. I just don't know if that's what aesthetic means.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

The Aesthetic‚Ñ¢
Like making perfectly good waffles and pouring soap over them because it looks neat

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-04*

...

have..

have you done that?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

Goodness no those poor waffles
But it‚Äôs a common occurrence

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-04*

goodness, scared me for a sec

wasted waffles

is a nono

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*



tfw you go to post a picture of a particular cosplay and then recall you don't have any pictures of that cosplay eyylmao

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*



I would not have guessed she didn't do solo shoots before Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Yea me neither üòÆ

~~shes so pretty~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

mhmm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Omg this is the stupid 14 person shoot I think

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

she said "solo" though?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Oh idk the group shoot was in that very same spot

Like literally right where she stood so I guess not

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

I walked past it at one point.

Think with Lissy and her Dad?

Can't remember.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

The one you had to pay for?

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

yeah that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

The one Sakura did

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

yeah. I'm not sure if she planned it though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Ohhh yea I realized this but I don't think I ever mentioned it. At Collosalcon East there was a swimsuit Mikasa and I was like "wow dat girl is so pretty and BA looking like wow 10/10" and turns out was Jesse. Opps

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

I'd believe it.

Sakura was at the rwby stuff for colossal.

tangentially, Sakura posted some ladybug photos with her boyfriend I really liked. I dunno why she doesn't have him along at cons but they're cute together.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Ooo yea I saw dat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Oh boy Instagram is recommending league cosplay



**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

don't go that way Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Ha hahaha

Welcome to my world

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

stay in the light!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

_go towards the light you say?_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

"Did you want recommendations for LoL, Dark Souls, Tekken, Street Fighter etc?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

_G O I N G_

Lmao

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-04*

‚ù§

thats a sweet ezreal tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Msginnyliz voted that I post too much Pyrrha and Weiss

orz time to die

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

don't listen to Cinder, she a binch.

ha, you know what she might actually be doing it for the meme.

she seems the type.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

I hope so üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

eh, not like it matters. Cos what you want grrl.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Yeahhhh that's truuuuue

_hurriedly finishes my vault suit so I can have variance_

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

this is why I asked if you were stressin it...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

_not til now I wasnt_

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Learn to recognize questions that you won't want answers to.

It's a useful skill.

Even more useful when you actually don't ask them, unlike me who acknowledges I don't want the answer and asks anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Nooo id rather be informed

Also I didn't care what randos say

_but msginnyliz_

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Can deal with it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Hell ethan said I need variance and I was like ok lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Oh Ethan. You and your opinions.

He sent me a thing on Instagram which was a cut on someone's leg with the caption "tfw he says cut me I dare you and you do üòÇ"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Yeah he sent me that too

That's Jonathan

Who flew up to comfort ethan from his break up

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

I'm not sure why he thought that was funny...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

I don't get him

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Nice of Johnathan.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Yeah

And ethan stabs him?

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

That's just how Ethan expresses his emotions.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Weird

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

it's sarcasm though.

You know him better than me.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-04*

yeah he sent me that too

i ...

did not respond

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Same.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-04*

although i might as well have gotten that from Mikey. If you gave me a message from one of them with the name scribbled out i wouldnt be able to tell who is who

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

New game: Ethan or Mikey

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

I had a new game idea.

I forget it though.

I get the feeling it was a setup for an angsty line though. So forgetting is for the best.

Hey remember that ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù person on Instagram that I blocked

What do now



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Ugh that reminds me that I gotta make the Anext RWBY event

~~to save it~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

People gonna love you for it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Omg did they make another account?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

I don‚Äôt think so?? This account is also private but it‚Äôs also got a description that seems real?

Maybe some weird bot virus?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Damn y u make people fall in love with you?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

üò≠

[responds to comment] can u not

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Ugh I have no idea how to deal with creeps

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

This one isn‚Äôt following me. Maybe the first person used their friends phone or account?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Wtfffff

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

I'd get on that then Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*



I think this person just wants me to cosplay SAO

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

lol.

You'd probably pull off Asuna well, but after the second arc she only fills half of the 'powerful redhead' requirement.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*

Ew

Lame

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Asuna doesn't have red hair..

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

red...dish.

anyway, Georgia is unlikely to cosplay her.

(ahem. Of course unless you want to, then ignore the crazy person)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-05*

i agree that sword art first arc would be a perfect fit for georgia

but the rest.

ehhhhhhhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*

So Ive heard

She just becomes waifu arm candy or something

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Or.... Gets raped....

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*

O H

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

not like, 'sao became porn' but pretty much.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-05*

is she canonly raped?

I know sexual assault happens but idr if rape is canon

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

you have it right.

There was a porn chapter of SAO, but it was in the original web novel version and just Kirito and Asuna having their first time.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Yea I didn't quite remember. Sorry I didn't watch too much of that scene üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

lol nothing to apologize for. Was still lewds.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

*looks for said first time chapter*

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

16.5.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

i think I read half of it. iirc it's basically a bad romance novel.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-05*

so vanilla fifty shades of grey

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

I mean isn't the point of 50 shades that it's bdsm?

Vanilla is just vanilla.

I mean bad romance novel in the shitty smut books old women read kind of way.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-05*

my big sister descibes 50 shades as "poor quality fanfic bdsm smut written for teenage girls"

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

It's def shitty fanfic, its also pretty creepy ü§î it's just twilight fanfic

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

I haven't read it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

I have! üòê

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

pity.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Yeeeet

now I read much higher quality fanfic

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

SMUTTY fanfic?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

üòè

Welp that uhhh 16.5 chapter was pretty shitty not gonna lie

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

I have a soft spot for SAO and I'll be the first to admit he's not a great writer.

Especially not for softcore porn.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-05*

Georgia we can be sword art cosplay tomodachis
Jess we don‚Äôt talk about that chapter

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

Nice try Mari.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

Now I see why... üòü

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

I'm so glad you immediately went to read it though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

im trash ü§∑

but MAN that was bad.

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

last time I looked at 16.5 I was in middle school.

I should "accidentally" send the link to Erik's photos when I finish them to Rebecca, before Erik.

"whoops wrong chat"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

LMAO nooooooo

omg those two! she posted that she was listening to zeppelin cuz she know he like them. he watch fma after her recommendation AHHHH

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

If I will not be shipped, then I will ship!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

i ship it so hard üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*



Is this a canon A2 cosplay?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*

Oh wow that's less skin than I thought

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

there ussually more in the middle though

https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/nier/images/3/31/A2-sinoalice.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20170827155350

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

The outfits take clothing damage.

Pretty sure after enough combat A2 ends up in a crop top?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-05*

I don't think they do take clothing damage

We play the same game?

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

yeah, they do.



That's the base concept art.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-05*

im pretty sure they dont

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

I definitely remember A2 looking crappier after a fight.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

yea i dont think they do either

maybe she get dirtier? but a2 never looks that good, she always beat up and dirty

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

_shrugs_

I'll have to check at home.

I tried to check via teamviewer: apparently teamviewer doesn't allow repeated key inputs so I can't do much.

rip.

awww, that's cute.

Jake Scribbles started a kofi project for his colossal con cosplay that matches Mangaloo's new one.

he's going to be disappointed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

*donates*

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

_'s plan worked, pity donations for secondary party_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

not really, gotta spend money on my own cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

that's okay, I don't particularly care if he gets funded.

I wondered once or twice if I should set up ko-fi, since tips and all that.

*But people don't even anonymously do sarahah questions, why would they psuedo anonymously give me money?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

it really blew up like everyone is doing it now

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

mhmm.

Kinda patreon without the stigma.

But the cosplay community is definitely riding from one fad to the next.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

ooo yea

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

not strictly a bad thing, just amusing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

yea its kinda cray to try to keep up

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

just do what interests you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

none if it XD ha i mean boudoir is interesting, i think it might be fun but i have family on my insta. Religious family

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

You can do it for yourself then.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

yea but thats alot of effort XD

I mean if i already happened to have stuff for something then thats coo but i wont spend extra money on it

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I'd say 'do it' as I'm usually the enabler around here, but boudoir is *not* something I'm comfortable enabling. Gotta want to do it without external input.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

I want to, i just dont see a point and also id prob only be comfortable having a girl friend or tom take the pics. it be more like armature hour shit obvi. but yea only personal use. idk how to feel about it. i thinks its coo for other peeps though

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Gabi was/is a photographer isn't she?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

yee

basically i dont have enough interest to actually go through with it, plan it out, get an outfit together, etc. also i dont know how gabby really feels about cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

Might be less how she feels about cosplay and more about boudoir.

same difference though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

she mentioned it before in passing

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

pfft.

"Hey can you pass the butter?"
"Yeah sure, you know, do you want boudoir photos?"
"Thanks"
"Here's the jam too."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-05*

lmao

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

Hear me out:

Ryan. training Erik in the power of Ryan.

I know the power of Ryan makes no sense, but you know exactly what I mean.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-05*

which power of ryan

to be half naked or

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

possibly.

Depending on how deep the rabbit hole Erik can go.



Staaaaaap

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

Ooooooo is that the same thing that takes off 2bs skirt?

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

yeah, A2 gets a damage boost in exchange for damage over time though.

Rather than a boom.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

I bought a costume from that show that sucks but has catchy music that I listen to on loop because it was cheap and I am weak for cosplay. What have I done.

They put it in a nice discreet bag though. Hide your cosplay shame.

Discreet bag came in mega handy when I didn‚Äôt have the time or cash to stop home in between Akiba and school <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

tfw easter and april fools day are on the same day
also april 1st is another acosta event i'mma gonna go to but i has no easter cosplay
sad
kurousagi or bunny miku are really the only appropriate things I could wear but those are in the US and I don't feel like remaking/buying new ones. nachetania and rabi en rose might borderline work but too much work for no sewing machine uguu

wish i had akko ; u ;

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

do you have bunny lucina with you?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

naw she came to mind too (I wanted to improve her before wearing again) but might be too scandalous for acosta events. you have to walk through an entire mall of normies between the cosplay changing rooms and outdoors so anything too lewd isn't good

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

oh god

thats sounds horrific even by american standards

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

Cosplay in Japan sucks.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

i've become she who i hate the most even though she's super comfy and fits pretty perfectly



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-06*

thats all that matters <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

but she has fancy pattern socks UGH girl pls

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-06*

do you not has those?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

naw they didn't come with the costume. i can make 'em but sewing socks is one of my least favorite things to sew. socks and vinyl on shoes.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-06*

yeah that doesnt sound fun :c

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

what character is this?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

i think her name is hinata she the main girl in the brother harem anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWZfnlYUB_4

~~with super catchy theme songs~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

üòÆ all those boys are her brothers?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

ye she gets adopted into the family when her father remarries or something. plus she's adopted anyway so double not-related yet related.

it a little freaky they range from like 12 to 31 years old

that second girl isn't a girl it's the crossdressing brother of course

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

holy wow thats alot of not brothers

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-06*

ofcourse

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

3 of them are twins <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> one's in her class in school, another is her senpai, another is her kouhai. you got the whole gamut from doctors and lawyers to sports players, anime voice actors, idols, fashionistas, a priest, and also I'm pretty sure the squirrel is also a love interest



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

nani

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

LMAO a priest? a squirrel?  OH that kind of squirrel

this is a boy?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

~~aldus?~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

NA man aluds girly but not THAT girly

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

ya here you go
all these plus squirrel. also lists their ages:

romance the 10 year old elementary school brother. not creepy at all.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

oh wow, yea that is a 21 yr age range there

how old is she?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

She‚Äôs in the same class as Yuusuke so probably 16

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

who she end up with?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-06*

Marry the brother twice your age. Totally natural. 
It‚Äôs open ended since the anime is part of a dating game, anime kind of winds up with her getting an equal chance at everyone. I‚Äôd hope her classmate because he liked her first being in the same class and all. He tsundere and also has a horrible singing voice it‚Äôs amazing. Each character has songs and the dude can‚Äôt sing whatsoever so his parts are awesome.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

the red haired one?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-06*

Wowweeee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

üòÆ

but yea i do the same thing XD

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

I sent her a message when I saw it. Told her that for what's it's worth her Pyrrha was fantastic. Chatted a little about mistakes and trying things.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

<@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> do u has Zenkai line up?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-06*

Noooooo not yet, Tom's working on something new but he's not sure if it's gonna be done in time

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

_Mark is doing Jacques Saturday of Zenkai_

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

did he want to shoot with you, or just inform you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

he said he wasnt sure what day, and was definitely gonna make it saturday now

so yeah i guess thats expressing interest?

i just made an instagram chat to gauge everyones interest in a schnee shoot

.... a schoot

hue

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-06*

*groan*

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

And I thought you were the cool one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

_it was right there_

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

that sounds like Mark though. 99% sure he and Audrey have never done a private shoot.

You know how jakescribbles is like, always in the background of what ever casey comes up with? 

I'm like Chinese knockoff jakescribbles, always in the background of BNE's finest without any of the cool props.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-07*

lol

pyrrha dead

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

oooo. i could get an adult nia cosplay for $5. tempting.
a sign from the universe to stop cosplaying children.

3 whole cosplays for $40. i wuv japan.
now if only we didn't need to pay to actually wear the costume to events.

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

watch you end up paying more long term.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

i will need another $20 for shoes, and a small amount for fabric and buttons for saber's cuffs and maybe trim for sonia's socks if I feel people will notice I don't have that white line on the top of her socks.
fake lashes are $1. i'll need some darker makeup for contouring which I could probably just use eyeshadow for for maybe $5? I won't wear adult Nia here I'll ship her back home. The rest are pretty complete though.
Then $15 every time I want to wear them ; u ;

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

which saber?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

meido

i have the poofiest underskirt that I got for like $8. I did not expect it to be so poofy.



look at that beast with the collar having fallen off the hangar oops

dis girl



i have everything but the cuffs assembled

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

nice.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

hmmmmm. the petti might be *too* poofy for sonia. i worried. but it may work.

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

What motivated you to cosplay this Saber.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

she isn't japanese and she was on sale <:lenny:395307171539189760>

I'm a little self-conscious about cosplaying japanese characters in japan because i am not japanese and literally everyone else can do awesome japanese cosplays. I figured i'd cosplay non-japanese characters instead

i'm gonna save brother harem girl for a US con

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

but not self conscious about the french maid outfit?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

naw i got a bodysuit because the back is super open and the shoulders are wide, gonna sew the maid fuku to the bodysuit.
have u not seen some of the cosplays I've worn. so hazukashii.

I have a swimsuit cosplay too for Mari from Eva because not 100% japanese and wears glasses. when I cosplayed her school uniform I didn't even use a wig. but I look too much like myself when I cosplay her so probably won't do her unless it's a private beach event like the one I did Rin for 2 years ago.

rin/nowi for possibly lewdest cosplay. hmm.

nowi had a nice cape tho

i'm gonna update my cosplay paper

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

you brave girl.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

*adds jaehee to the list because I literally have everything to cosplay her*
I just need to print a piece of paper to stick in a lanyard.
I have a wig that works for her and a fake realistic looking white cat.

I think that's everyone.
I have a, how do you say, problem. Yes.

only canon versions of costumes so stuff like christmas ruby or dress ladybug isn't included

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

list is invalid then.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

wat

[makes and buys more costumes to make it valid]

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

you need to include non canon stuff.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-07*

I was gonna buy a morgiana costume because my friend does aladdin but it got sold. dang.
also considered a disney princess because they aren't japanese and are super popular, and my friend can also cosplay them. they're on amazon here for like $20 (Anna and Ariel are). But the big hoop skirts ehhhhh.

how u expect me to remember all non-canon stuff

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

Lanie, Rebecca, and the girl from the UK who said she likes him on sarahah.

Mmmmmmmmmmm WELP

well.

Shows my opinion of randoms on the internet.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-07*

thank u internet randos

so do i ignore it

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

Do you want to?

Pretty sure Meg got a few like that and she just says 'thanks!' and dismisses em. But if you don't want to encourage more like it you can just ignore it.

mmmmm ill ignore it

him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-07*

and your thoughts?

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

I told him I'd rather he did and he agreed.

from a proactive stand point, I don't want to give the impression I do like it, and in thinking about it's not even the case of I don't want to it. I want the photo to be impressive on it's own right, not because of some photoshopping.

tom don't worry 
I only exist as a mass hallucination that plagues the world in some ways and benefits it in others
I'm also sometimes considered an algerian jhin that appears to offer conversation, 
or a creature that exists in people's dreams, occasionally making my presence apparent in the real world 
If I suddenly don't appear on the internet, its cause in reality, I never truly existed to begin with 
üëç

(note these were all/are accepted explanations for 
1. how I can go anywhere and run into somebody I don't expect
2. why so many people know/have heard of me
3. I can apparently appear out of nowhere and also disappear out of nowhere,

Which one looks better





I can't tell

**Bill** - *2018-03-11*

First one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-11*

Aye aye

Also bill you specifically did you use a diff lens between the JNPR photos and the penny/Pyrrha photos

**Bill** - *2018-03-11*

Nope.

I used the 35mm all Katsu.

Why?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-11*

Huh cause one has a blurred background and the other doesn't

Is that something you did after the fact?

LAYS ON THE FLOOR GEN WANTS TO DO BOUDOIR TOO, IS IT EVERYONE?

**Bill** - *2018-03-11*

Yeah I just saw that too. ^^;;

Pretty sure I shot Penny Pyrrha at 1.8. You can check in the details of the picture on flickr.

Aperture.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-11*

I SAW THAT TOO

We were just talking about that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-11*

Oh well I like dat keep doing it, the blur thing is kewl

And YEAH guess we HAVE to do jaune and Ren cherry blossom boudoir now I GUESS

**Bill** - *2018-03-11*

I guess the question is whose going to go through with it, and whose aiming to post the stuff.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-11*

You know you can manually add blur to images in Photoshop too üòè

**Bill** - *2018-03-11*

I did wider aperture intentionally at Katsu, so there were less pictures with one person in focus and the others not.

Chalk blurred background as a solo shoot perk as well Georgia.

Should I be aware of this RWBY group shoot?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-11*

YEAH were talking about a time

i didnt wanna let you know til we confirmed one

its looking like 5:30-6:30 is the best spitballed idea

but also finding a damn ruby is impossible

**Bill** - *2018-03-11*

We're you going to ask me about the time...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-11*

oh well duh

i was checking with them too tho

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

<@!245270932602486784> show me the particular pictures you were comparing between JNPR and Quarters.

whenever you get a chance, dunno how long you're at Hal's.

t'wasn't a paid shoot. i was eating cold leftovers when i got a message from friends i hadn't seen in 2 years and i went to go meet them but while searching for them i ran into another friend who was doing a photoshoot and we were cosplaying the same series so she let me join her shoot yay. and then the peeps i was originally searching for found us yay. she said she got the pictures shortly after the con but I never saw them and didn't press to see them because it wasn't my shoot. but here they are. amazing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Nice!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

Neato!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

kind of surprised there hasn't been a lot of Coco cosplay. frozen and inside out and wreck-it ralph all spawned a ton of cosplays. even the book of life had a bunch of cosplayers. have y'all seen any coco ones?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Coco? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

ye and OH NO SOMEONE POSTED A COUPLE COSPLAY PICTURE FROM SOMEONE THEY BROKE UP WITH they acknowledged they deleted the picture from all their social media accounts but the costume was really special to them so they reposted it again. that's sad.

dis movie, longest box office run for an animated picture in the 21st century, won a couple oscars

big hero 6 had a bunch of cosplayers too but this earned a lot more than bh6

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Ooooo yeaaaaaa I never saw that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

I HAVE ARRIVED AT HOME anyways Ye sure I can



**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Good to know.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

okaeri desu

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*



<@!184437198865563648> THE WORLD IS TOO SMALL

I was LIKE LOL THATS THAT PERSON THAT SOUNDS REALLY COOL

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Well. That happened.

I mean, sure. That‚Äôd be interesting.

To say the least.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

she was at konkon :0

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Where the frick did snow get that connection

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

No idea.

From my multiple 1 minute conversations with Kelly and her Facebook, she seems nice enough. I can just never talk to her.

You notice the background difference that much in the pictures?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

It was one of those times where I had one open on my phone

And I was zoning out

I wouldn't notice it if I was just posting

But I zoned out and went huh has that always had that blur

And then compared them

I had the quarters one open first and then cross referenced it with JNPR

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

how I imagine that went:

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Yeah... Katsu I actively kept the aperture higher than prior cons. Got tired of out of focus people.

The blur I can get from the 1.8 isn‚Äôt that pretty so I wanted to prioritize everyone being in focus.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Ooooo sou desu ne

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I mean, most of the prior shoots would be at 1.8. Do you remember ever seeing a pretty blur effect from one of my photos?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

I meaaaaan I never noticed anything in particular, cause my priority is usually whether or not I look like a doof

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*



That‚Äôs more noticeable than I though... but that‚Äôs a much cleaner background too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

I think the difference is a lot between solo and group shots, but you acknowledged that





There's not really blur in those two?





Some SICKNASTY blur in these two



^^ that one I can't really tell it looks half yes half no

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

nice homestuck reference

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

My skin looks so good in that last one, is that the lighting or camera or actually hydrated skin

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I told you I‚Äôve always liked that shoot. Something about it clicked perfectly.

If all of those are 1.8 aperture, the distance to the subject (you) is what changes the depth of field.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Ahhhhhh okay

They talked about lenses in my online class thing today so I'm like YES PHOTOGRAPHY

So is that why the double dragons selfie has HELLA blur

And Pyrrha is shot on an angle so it has dubious blur?

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

No, that's just the pose.

In talking about dynamicness I'm suddenly really seeing the flatness in my photos.

It's... pretty bad.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

DUDE NAH I ALWAYS THOUGHT MY POSING WAS TOO STIFF

Every artiste must feel this way

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I take photos of people other than you.

There's a snapshot quality to them.

No sense of dimension to the person.

I need to research and then do some practice.

Among all the other things.

Sigh.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

If you need someone to stand in the cold again

üëâüòéüëâ

I feel that tho with the practice

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Well, it's getting warmer.

I don't know when we'd find the time, but doing that would be really good for both of us... but it'd insist plain clothes. Not even like when Ben did that fashion shoot; your favorite jeans and Rutgers hoodie. The focus is entirely on the posing and camera work, not any potential photos to come of it.

Georgia: *suddenly lowers hand*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

*RAISES HAND HIGHER* im down for comfort

I'd probably swap out Rutgers for NASA though :3c

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

You get the idea.

We'll figure it out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Aye aye captain

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I hate spending weekends alone these days anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

My Sundays usually ain't bad as long as I'm da area

And even working Saturdays, still opportunity for SLEEPOVER PARTY

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Tangentially low key can't wait for fire pit weather.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Ooooh boy pump the brakes

That's the cosplayer that was trying to get lewds before she turned 18

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

OH NO why would somebody do that
oh no child no

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Ohhhh boyyyyy

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

No thank you dutchess is baaaad news.

Rest of the fabric will be turned into bows

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

This be half the fabric I got just for bows

Also some fur because it was a dollar and I can make tiny lions and use the fur for the manes :3c

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

ooo adorable

i need that

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*



Actual Labinnak isn't doing well.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

o

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

saw that too

sucks, she seems really down to earth and chill

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

o no üò¶

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

So what's up with the Ruby search?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

welp snow talked to dynamic duchess

ive been trying to ignore it cause i guess shes a nice person

but dynamic duchess is kind of a wacko

so eh?

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Agreed, I'd avoid her if we can.

Taking photos with her makes me fear I'll be arrested.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

i mean

shes wierd but she seems fine

Duchess i mean

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

She's... yeah.

It's not like, a malicious bad. But definitely not a person I want to shoot with.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

yeah so im wondering how to say no nicely........................

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Well, start with 'Artoriagrey has first dibs'.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

do i be upfront with snow/leanna that im not keen on shooting with her?

prob not snow, snow gossips

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Leanna is fairly mature, I think she'd get it...

definitely not Snow.

Have you gotten in touch with grey yourself yet?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

just say eyy sorry i think i found one ehhh

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Oh yeah, that'd work. Even if Grey falls through you, at the time, did have someone else.

then you can conveniently forget to message her if it falls through.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

soooo

message artoria?

be like "hii im ~~wezrez~~ georgia, Snow mentioned you might be interested in being our ruby, just wanted to formally introduce myself"

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I mean, why beat around the bush? You're the organizer for the shoot. (I assume.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

i just dont want duchness knowing that she actively makes ~~everyone~~ me uncomfortable

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I also don't trust snow as a go between.

me too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

so i guess ill tell leanna the truth cause shes matURE

and introduce myself to artoria to... lure her in?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Yeah snow is immature, we got the same feeling

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

OH THANK GOD LEANNA FOUND A NEW RUBY ITS THE BLAKE FROM MY KATSU SHOOT

BLESS UP

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Oh good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

bless leanna

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Are you picking her then?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

yeah

daydreamc0splay

she was friendly and a good blake

also a really good ruby

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Rip Grey tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

/time to break the news to duchess oops

yeah so thank god for leanna tho what a relief

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

well, I feel bad for Grey in that case but it's good you have the rwby and you know daydream will show up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Yeah artoria sounded a little iffy too

like she wasnt quite sure of her line up anyways

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Afaik she does a dozen shoots every con.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

dayum

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

probably still coordinationing.

Little disappointed though. After she never replied (even to turn it down) to my suggestion of shooting Katsu I said I wasn't going to message her myself cause like, that was already going out on a limb. Her showing up yesterday *did* seem rather twist of fate.



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

the mythical

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

SCREAMS I WENT TO GET PAINT FOR MY PIP BOY AND I FOUND A DEAD MOUSE

My motivation to work on cosplay was just shot in the face

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Joy's of basements

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

aww. Go get some chili's.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Lmao ye what basement doesn't have mice

Ick

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Yes because seeing dead animals usually makes poeole want to eat

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

See plenty of roadkill in our area, don't we?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Yea but I'm not like "yea now I'mma eat"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Like I bent down, took out the paint, thought "hm it smells like hamster", turned my head, BAM DEAD MOUSE

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

*better than alive mouse*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Bet you nyoomed outta thwre

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Grabbed my paints and DARTED

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Oooo yeeee one time at Jess's parents I was on my computer at night, turned my head and boom

Alive mouse staring at me

I was literally like..
"Oh... Sup?"

(Jess lived in the basement let me clarify)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

One time I opened the dryer to get cloths for work. I was naked (hence getting clothes) and a mouse jumped out at me

Another time I was sleeping and a mouse ran up the length of my body and woke me up. He was just sitting there on my arm. So I swatted him off, screamed and ran upstairs

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

I have also been awoken by a mouse running over my covers, and a daddy longleg in my face. Ahhh good times. üò®

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

I've only found mice in my garage and one other time in the basement

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I've never had any of this.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

always post mortem

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

The fsux.

I did see a giant rat in NYC the other week.

Dumbass was on the subway tracks.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Oh shitt

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Well you didn't live in a basement so

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

True.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

That ye

And your basement is finished

And above ground

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Well so was ours lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

The back isn't finished, but yeah. We don't have mice problems. Cave crickets.

No mice.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Oo those too

We had both

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Oh my basement used to get crickets and then it just stopped

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Kept us up at night with thier chirping

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

Ew

lurking in voice if anyone needs me

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Yeah if you can avoid it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

painting my pip boy üëå

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Don't live in the basement

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Meanwhile, Katy wanted to move down there.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Is it the pip boy from the game launch?

Or a replica of it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

25 dolla replica

its pretty nice it just looks too clean and new for cosplay

so im fuckin it up a bit lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-12*

Yeeeee

I'd jump in to discuss things for 15 mins before I pick up sushi but we've discussed literally everything

üò±

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I could before dinner, but might as well let you focus.

After dinner I'll be on voice though, questions and site formatting lessons. Actually should make that vidya.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*



I really like one of my friends photos cause the posing and "mood" is pretty cool

But it just looks so fuzzy to me



**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

nice photo.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-13*

Yeah lighting and posing is nice but ye also fuzzy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

i was wondering if it was just me

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

could be the fact that it's a wide photo fit into instagram's cropping.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

Me;'eyeing a park across the road from the dealership because of its gazebo: that's a nice park, what's it for?

Mom: that. Is a cemetery.

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

üòÖ

While I have seen people do shoots in graveyards, I'd rather build a set of one than go to a real one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

na go to real one that shit aint worth the time

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

There's half a dozen stations on the morris essex line that have gazebos. Really need to pay attention to which ones.

some are quite nice.

it's a moral dilemma Jess. Same reason I wouldn't use a church interior for a shoot unless the pastor okay'd it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

ah

dont think you could use a church without getting it okay but thats besides the point

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

mhmm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

"ok sir. if i attend mass in the morning. i can use the church to do a photoshoot of a bloody snow princess fighting a giant suit of armor. deal?"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-13*

~~My tail? thats what he meant? shittt~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

i forgot to mention if for some reason we need fake blood for a photoshoot

i found like two liters of fake blood in my basement

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

*or is it real blood*

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

well, that's old news.

We ended up with grey towers as the top of the list for Weiss trailer iirc.

trailer 2 was central park, which I guess I should go to at some point.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

oh yeah thats one usage

but two liters is a lot more than just a weiss head wound

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

we have to plan doing that, particularly with Grey tower. May have to submit a request. (but it should be free).

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

thats the cool looking place thats got the lookout kinda area right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

yeah grey towers looks KEWL

I'd be great if we could fit in that practice shoot before going though...

Good news on the Leanna Ethan front.

Assuming she'd be straight with me and say if she did. Which I can't imagine she would, now that I think about it. we barely know each other.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-14*

yeah but although shes a tough nut to crack in terms of what she's thinking, i dont think they hooked up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

I think I wanna do a giveaway for 3k followers but the idea I have is really cheesy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

this is so cuuuuteeee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

ikkk i was worried about it being too cheesy but im liking it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

NO its adorable i love it, can i enter? XD what do i have to do?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

yeah you can enter lol itll be randomly selected winner so everyone is fair game

and thats what im wondering too, how ill have people enter

should i separate it into diff sections so people enter for only one character?

or have it all in one post, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th place get to choose which one they get in that order?

and then im wondering how people join, maybe they repost my graphic with their fav cosplay pic of mine?

idk .-.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

ooo idk how giveaways usually go ><

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i think ill do the second option, where whoever gets first place gets first dibs, and so on

that just makes it easier

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

yea thats prob easier

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

than having to keep track of four diff giveaways essentially

ye

is it too presumptuous to have people repost the graphic with their fav cosplay pic of mine on their account?

i guess not, thats how i see other share for shares working

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

i mean is ee other ppl do it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

yeah and if other people do it, its gotta be okay lol

i wont start the giveaway til the end of the month prob, cause thats also probably about the time ill conveniently hit 3k

which is a good excuse to do it lol

oH jess id probably wanna use the wezrez cosplay logo youve been drafting (bless you and your helpfulness) then too

if thats okie

(idk how copyright works)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

oh yea sure! i changed it a lil but is on my work computer

which is totally shouldn't be

of course youd be able to use i made it for you, i guess just credit me? but i dont even care that much about it XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

swag <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

should i maybe swap out the make up for them all to be scented moisturizers

what if a boy that doesnt wear make up wins a prize bag lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

he can experiment!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-15*

often times they have a female friend ready to take it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

you think?

idk rose scented lotion may be better than red lipstick

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-15*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I have lots of female friends and two sisters I usually ditch make up p easily

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

betcha Ethan will.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-15*

Chance to get in pantsu 2 for Ethan

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Leanna doesn't seem that into him. He's got his other 6 booty calls he has available anyway.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

has dansu to pantsu been at any cons recently? I can't recall seeing them perform for a while. at least since 2016 otakon I think.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

whats dat?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

they a dance group that go to eastern cons. they perform at katsu a lot too, but not on stage, they just stage dances in the hallway. usually in that hall by the elevators on the gazebo level is where they do it at katsu, and by the indoor fountains was where they'd perform at ota before the move

girl who forms the kigu parties is a member

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Oh <@!301927856240459777> still up?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

hewwo

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

you know how you browse like thousands of cosplay pictures?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

you want me to photoshop you onto one??

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

I need to know where you do that. My photos are flat looking and need more dynamicness to them.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

i browse them on the interwebs

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

So I need to see references of cosplay photography, and good photography not just the crap on the katsu facebook group.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

i went to look up a site but look at this cute violet. nice saturation.

http://cosp.jp/view_photo.aspx?id=12376313&m=84525

http://cosp.jp/photo_search.aspx is probably the best site aside from sifting through social media tags. WorldCosplay is nice too but the quality is higher overall on Archive here. i can't remember if you need an account, try clicking on an image and see if it'll let you view it without an account.

social media tags often have nsfw in them ;~;

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

violet is cute, but that looks like a water color and it's weird. Especially given the series.

yeah, you can view it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

contrast: down
highlights: up
saturation: up
party: on

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

that'll do. Thank you Marisa.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

time to look at cosplay pics

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

i am forcibly removed from the photoshop

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

any picture in this gallery I could tell you what conditions it was taken in because i was at the event

http://cosp.jp/photo_search.aspx?n5=168223

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

It's more camera metadata I'd be interested in.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

cosmode usually has good tips

https://cosplaymode.net/?p=2058

the pictures on that site usually list the camera data too, on the bottom of the page with the picture

lemme find an example

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Mari-chan, I can't read that level of japanese anymore, if ever.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

did they change it??? i can't find any pics with camera info

but its got camera numbers in numerals, and shutter speed is written in katakana and ISO is in english

like here's an example using one of your pics that I posted to archive, that lists the camera info

https://cosplaymode.net/?p=2058

wrong link oops

http://cosp.jp/view_photo.aspx?id=12335170&m=443235

if you click that you'll see at the bottom the camera information

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

i was referring to cosmode.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

also that image was viewed 80 times and has a star~

ye cosmode

shutterspeed is written in katakana, ISO is in english, other numbers are pretty self explanatory if you look at the picures

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

http://cosp.jp/photo_search.aspx?n1=443235 <- social media Marisa actually uses.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

wow who's that nerd

maybe I should erase the english on my profile. even though I have japanese people message me in google translate english anyway.

everytime i see that kyoukai no kanata pic the song gets stuck in my head

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

why do they all have such plasticy looking faces...

Tis weird.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-15*

on archive? makeup apps.

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Lissy cut her hair short.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

like SHORT short?

no not SHORT short but AWW SHES ADORABLE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

OMG cute

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

hmm.

I don't love the bangs. But hair always looks weird when you just get it cut.

*my opinion is also irrelevant but*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

i didnt look too closely but looked cute to me, i love straight bangs lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

_shrugs_

opinion doesn't matter.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i dont wanna work on my vault suitttttt

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

I blame league.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i mean yes i wanna play league instead

but like, its doing the legs of the vault suit which is a hard part

and im not even 100% happy with the top the way it is now

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

If you aren't happy with it, you have motivation to improve it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

or infinite procrastination, worrying it wont turn out ok

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

There's no such thing as a mistake; only trying something.

Or do nothing, and nothing will never change.

I should really heed my own advice.

!choose barcade, penn

You should choose  penn

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

My mom said not to worry, the suit looks fine so I guess I'll finish the bottom part tonight

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

I supposed I should have led with that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

I mean my mom is SUPER nitpicky so if she says it's okay then it must be

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-15*

Yeah it does look good, don't worry frien

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

You da best after all.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

thank -w-

**Bill** - *2018-03-16*

It's just a fact.

i was super worried when maykacos said she was cosplaying yaomomo but it was really smart to use flesh-colored fabric for the front instead of going open shirt like the character has. good job.

**Bill** - *2018-03-16*

So desu ne.

Rebecca wants to cos lucky Chloe <@!351785752197201920>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

yeah she has a mental breakdown midway through the episode and changes personalities

**Bill** - *2018-03-16*

Those makeup apps look like garbage.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

[gasp] you take that back

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-16*

binge group when?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

and then once y'all watch the anime, read the manga, and I have a link to the stage play I can send you it covers the water tribe arc that occurs after the anime ends

since yellow dragon doesn't appear until the last episode there are also 2 ovas that have his backstory but they skip ahead like 70 manga chapters

**Bill** - *2018-03-16*

She's a strong powerful redhead Georgia. Who has a clear ship.

Probably why Meg suggested it.

ooo kyooot

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

the biggest trouble cosplayers have would be Kija's arm, and maybe hak's weapon. i dunno anyone whose made jaeha's leg because usually it's in the boot.

let us talk yona just like mystic messenger it will be great. 10/10

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-17*

but still likes your stuff so checks it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-17*

idk then

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Oh BOY in case anyone forgot today is Sakura's birthday.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

One of my cosplay friends came to japan and we were gonna cosplay together but she got mad at me for buying costumes? Like??? I couldn‚Äôt just bring a sewing machine with me, and my apartment has strict noise rules so I couldn‚Äôt use it much anyway. Apparently no one is allowed ever to buy costumes and if you do buy one it negates 10 years of sewing them. Wat.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-19*



Nani?!

Oh no a costume elitest

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

?

Think she's talking about the escape room.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-19*

No Marisa I mean

It was just out of order from the meme

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Ah.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

pincess? :0



i cri
i ain't hand sewing every costume

it's not that different. no big deal. just a matter of doing something in 5 minutes or in 5 days. nbd.

i think we no longer cosplay friends anymore

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Sounds like a dumb.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

baka

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Not a personal friend, just a con friend?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

ya we met at a costume contest and became con friends, but I didn't think she was like. a sewing elitist? 
most people at contests are super cool and helpful, like they'll lend you repair things if your costume malfunctions before judging and everyone helps each other to relax if they nervous.

she was that way
i guess things would've been different if we met in a bought costume <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Then no loss.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-19*

Yeah....

:üò∞

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

time to destroy my friendship shrine of her. [tears up pictures and burns piece of hair]

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

You got one of those to everyone?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

yes of course

what monster do you take me not to have a shrine for every person i know

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

*marisa, but rooting through wig caps for hairs from everyone*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

ah yes. the reason I don't go to panels late at night. to dig around the room and collect hair and skin samples for my friendship shrines.
and the bald friend who's always super clean? I dug a makeup sponge out of the garbage that they used. it rests next to their picture and the decomposing remains of a cookie they once offered me.

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

....

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

biru are you implying you don't keep friendship shrines
should everyone here send you some nail clippings to get started



**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

I really don't.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*



~~i'm joking about the friendship shrines pls don't feel weirded out~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-19*

You mean... There's no friendship shrines? üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-19*

can you imagine trying to pass through tsa security with like a suitcase half-filled with hair and nails and trash.
"ma'am what is this"
"oh i'm relocating my friendship shrines, it's the skin and hair of all my friends"
"oh of course how rude of me. carry on."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-19*

Lmfao totally normal

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-19*

There is an Ethan meme in there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-19*

If that wasn't Ryan I might be scared

But then again... EVERY MAN

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Wut? Is Ryan doing a Taiyang and getting with everyone in Georgia‚Äôs friend group? EVERYONE?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-19*

No but EVERY MAN you ahve ever spoken too has thought about sleeping with you according to Ethan

**Bill** - *2018-03-19*

Oh riiight.

... I feel like Ryan might be a weapon of mass destruction that‚Äôs untapped...

Were he to use his powers for evil, he could woo anyone. Anyone of us!

None would be immune.

;3c

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

I like the set a lot.

The last time I shot you and Hal as Arkos, it was Next and you like, freaked out at 2am.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-20*

sounds violent

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-20*

Lol I remember that

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

Yup. I'm still striving for that kind of reaction to a set.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-20*

You probably would have gotten it if you waited for the weekend and shared it on Friday night

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

Eh, you think?

I'd feel bad sitting on photos though.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-20*

The reason is when we're together our reaction to photos increases cause we can freak out together while cuddling over a phone

It's one of those excessive couple things

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-20*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

I'm feeling merging the group shoots with the private shoots into one section. With the pagination page length isn't a problem anymore.

and I doubt many people are out there thinking "i need to check only the group shoots done by this one dude".



Gasp. I'm INTERNATIONAL.

david want my fav cosplay pic his phone case but like I dont have a fav?

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

Gasp.

That explains why I didn't hear anything from him though.

Also, we missed a HUGE opportunity to shout out Georgia and take credit for her 3,000th follower.

I'm so disappointed.

It'd have been glorious payback.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-20*

hear anything about what?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-20*

from david he means

ye.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-20*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

Not that he had to, I'm not (at least, to most people) a in photos person so it'd be odd to ask. Being cosplay specific makes that much more sense.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-21*

Oops

**Bill** - *2018-03-21*

I've seen a few people going outside for photoshoots with the snow.



IT'S SO APPROPRIATE!

That Roman is the one who was supposed to run the shoot when the guy didn't show up. She was too busy trying to live stream it and that's when I said I'd do it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-21*

NICE

**Bill** - *2018-03-21*

<@!351471675843411978> Callout, there's not enough rwby on that cosplans list. üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-21*

Too bad üòù

I'm not feeling particularly inspired by any rwby characters right now. So for now it's just Nora

**Bill** - *2018-03-21*

Nora *variants*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-21*

*I have 4 allready*

**Bill** - *2018-03-21*

v4, Christmas...

ah, Pj.

then Swimsuit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-21*

Yup

**Bill** - *2018-03-21*

Should do Henceforward.

Or Nier.

Guess you could do Nier already.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-21*

I'm not really into the whole cross over cosplay thing as far as that goes.

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

see, there's a reason I said Sarah would be a good tamamoto.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-22*

That feel when your bs measurements are correct,mmph

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

cosplay kami-sama is smiling upon you

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-22*

Now I need to do that silver/gold design. Probably paint? hmmmm was gonna try a like gold trim thing but it's just so hard to mess with that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

AAAAAA



when someone reblogs an old cosplay post and you remember how nice the pictures are üëå

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*



That's the person I took over for. I'm not sure if I want to say anything.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-22*

eh theres not really a reason to

unless you think you have something in particular to say

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

I dunno. Thanks? Your welcome?

not really in particular I suppose.

I'm really tired of these share for share posts.

Sakura and now David.

The posts are graphic monstrosities, I can't tell what they about.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-23*

yea i usually just skip to the next persons story

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

Yup. Though I muted sakuras stories.

Too much crap.

It's the posts that bug me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-23*

Ohhhh yea

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-23*

I wanted to do that cosplay then vs now thing but I don‚Äôt have pictures of my old costumes and the one I found of like my 4th costume is this ominous shadow where you can‚Äôt see me <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>



**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

Gen needs to stop being so nice in her tags.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-23*

is that highschool?

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*



I feel indirectly called out.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-23*

ooo thats the salty dude isnt it?

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

kinda. it's not on a post with one of my photos, nor is actually saying anything but like...

I take 80% of Georgia's photos.

The fact that there's a noticeable concern at all...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-23*

im more thinking that hes calling out the person that took the photo he commented on

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

nah, it's not even salty.

```wezrez One of the big things I want to work on in the next year is taking more dynamic photos. Often, I find myself striking the same pose just because I know it works. But I shouldn't be afraid to try some new poses; After all, there's more to Pyrrha than smiling and raising her sword! üì∑ by @callmen00na #pyrrhanikoscosplay #pyrrhanikos #rwby #rwbycosplay #katsucon #katsucon2018
```

It was relevant advice based on the caption.

so... little called out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

I don't like when photographers tell me what to do üò§

I was just being nice to the dude

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

It is a good point. You can't see through the camera, so a good photographer should direct you in a small form. And `direct` is not `order` either; giving direction is more like suggesting something rather than saying 'do this' or 'that's wrong'.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

Yeaaah

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

nothing a model does is wrong, you just suggest changes based on how it looks in the frame.

the nothing is wrong thing is technically a politeness thing though. you can totally pose badly. A photographer just shouldn't *say* that, since it's rude and will make the model nervous.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

Yeee

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

Idk the way the guy said it was sorta abrasive

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

little bit, but I think it's the way he is.

from earlier comments.



I attempted to reveal the hidden Marisa.

I also did not realize that Weiss shot got 850+ likes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

Which one?

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

the last one you posted.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-23*

***no I must remain a shadowy edgelord***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-24*

Going with my dad in the morning to buy wood for magnild üôåüôåüôå

**Bill** - *2018-03-24*

Still going to Ethan's?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-24*

Why you gotta kill my buzz like that man?

**Bill** - *2018-03-24*

Eh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-24*

Yea.... We're still going

Unfortunately... I really don't wanna

**Bill** - *2018-03-24*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-24*

Oooooooooooo called OUT

**Bill** - *2018-03-24*

Well, she put a thing up for people to ask questions. Didn‚Äôt say she‚Äôd be putting names with the answers.

But I‚Äôm kinda petty, sure it‚Äôs a callout.

You can respond to the selfie tag on instagram.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-25*

Murder

What‚Äôs the selfie tag what is that 
Aren‚Äôt I obligated to tag more people 
That would inflict suffering

**Bill** - *2018-03-25*

alot of people have stopped tagging others.

you can just do the selfie part.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-25*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Boy, you too?

Guys are stupid.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

ethan voice: just cause theres a goalkeeper doesnt mean you cant score

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

***WHOOOA THERE.***

Savage!Georgia is revealed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

OH TRUE

~~MM cosplay group when~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Also, we were the only ones interested in jumping ship to magfest Georgia. Likely cause both of us went ham on photos and everyone else didn't.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

i was on the fence with anime nyc but maybe ill go just to have lux ü§î

yeah thats probably true

ill follow the crowd and go to katsu then

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

*Technically* I do the bookings buuuut.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

though ill be a successful car salesperson ~~hopefully~~ over the summer so thatll be some nice bank to pocket for cons

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

You will, I have no doubts about that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

magfest AND katsu? ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

no.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

yeah no thats asking to die

though magfest is over winter break

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

too close together to do two DC trips.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

true

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

yup, one of the mag perks.

Since when were you not going to ANYC.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

I don't have exact numbers, but gotta be at least 200+ a night.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

oof

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Technically that's most cons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

this kills the man

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Zenkai is the only one below 200.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

i guess yeah

i never thought about that

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

for connecting though, no idea what's close to javits center.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

ooooo yeah if its a day trip ill probably do yona then

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

im doing leo by myself *shrug*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

i could do Seven maybe but i feel like thats the only character that can stand alone

tom told me he no wanna do that though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

[chants from the back] lilith lilith!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

ill probably do lilith when you do though (shes kinda  a pain in mah butt) lolol

im not saying i dont wanna do something alone i just wouldnt do MC alone

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Understandable honestly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

just looks like regular clothes XD

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

And you don't see her except for CG.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

yeee. like the boys can stand by themselves, obviously sevens the most recognizable

ill buy stuff for seven and MC ~~and then if tom delays leo ill just force him to be seven~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

ah the boyfriend forcing mechanic

i mean wha i know nothing about that

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Snrk

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

but tom doesnt play the game so idk if hed do it

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

*do a tekken character*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

which one?

~~if i do tekken for you will you do MM for me?~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

you dont really have time to do tekken tbh, not with noras hammer

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

YEET

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

none of the outfits are overly simple

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

~~mm is cheap and easy~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

^

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

what character would i even do from tekken?

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

~~Do Jumin and reveal and reveal things about your relationship no one wanted to know~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

toms not tall enough for jumin

jumins like 6 foot

i mean thats not like a requirement but

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

You can borrow Hal for MM if I can borrow Tom for League, fair deal, no one loses

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

but hal would wanna do league also XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

He didn't seem to have anyone particular in mind üòÆ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

lol ill figure something out

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

then theres literally like only 1 character i can do

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

i mean your 2 inches off for seven thats no big deal

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

i mean height doesnt actually matter ~~im not kissing marisa GDI~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Jess: now gay as fuck with Georgia AND Marisa.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

AHHH WHY DO U HATE ME

i just wanna take cute couple pics D:

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

~~mm couples arent cute tho~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Where'd I put my sympathy...

They kinda cute.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

YES THEY ARE WTFFF

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

JuminXcage best ship.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

jumin and elizabeth

he says these things just to bother me i know it

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

y u hate me babe?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

lmao Im not doing mm

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

üò¶

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

i wanna do characters I care about

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Tom, 2 weeks before Zenkai: "I think I'll cosplay Seven."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

i know i know

ill trade you a cosplay for a game you like though

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

Jeez imagine if i was this insistent on you cosplaying them fighting game or league characters you dont care about üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

i mean in my defense you literally just said NO now

you avoided the question

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

so your argument is invalid

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

You can't guilt me, do the Mystic Messenger cosplay so it turns into a whole group!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

I think thats more likely with Yona then MM

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

üò¶

i dont wanna crossplay though

also y not both

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

MM is much easier to do that Yona. Yona requires making historical outfits.

THOU MUST.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-26*

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

it's honestly really weird being able to see while posing for pictures

"where am i supposed to look now that I can see everything"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-27*

lmaoo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-27*

so that person selling wigs is selling two kinds of blondes

which is more lux









im leaning towards a particular one but im not 100% sure

here lux



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-27*

id say the blonder one

as in yellower

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-27*

Yeah I'd say the yellower one

At least when they are side by side

When they are separate both look good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-27*

lux cosplayers use such light wigs what the heckie

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-27*

Probably just asthetic preference

Like I like the lighter blonde wigs more too but it doesn't look like luxes hair

Speaking of lighter blonde wigs ~~whens Arda getting back to me about backorder~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-27*

nevar

**Bill** - *2018-03-27*

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Remember the time you did exactly that in japanese class?

Just freaked out.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-28*

what when was that

was it every class

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

you right.

like that time you cosplayed to class.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-28*

!?
when was that
the only time I remember wearing a costume it was only partial

*biru i need the deets i have very short term memory*

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

I'm making this shit up.

and now finding out you apparently cosplayed to Sensei's class.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-28*

*biru*

there was an event in anime club that was a cosplay night around halloween once so i carried a costume in my bag but it was a random sailor uniform
maybe it was hiyori? there's a picture somewhere

oo i cosplayed yuki to club at one point. i don't remember that at all haha rip.

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Marisa is back to invisible.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-28*

I FINALLY ESCAPED HIM

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-28*

and then everyone promptly left the club

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

yuuuup.

Me and Andrew fixed it though.

~~not that you would know since you never came to club~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-28*

why club gotta go to midnight

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

So I'm watching these photography videos on youtube done by a photographer couple.

I wonder if she gets salty that he's doing the photography in a lot of them and she's the model.

https://www.amazon.com/Neewer-43-inch-Collapsible-Multi-Disc-Reflector/dp/B002ZIMEMW I should get one of these, but you basically need an assistant to use them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*



This is how i spend class time oops

I take constructive criticism plz and thank

OH I MISPELLED AWAY

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-30*

that was my only criticism damn

you took it xD

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

So... Apparently I AM on David's phone case.

He used one of my older profile photos.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-30*

oh wow

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*



i fix

GG david

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

very nice.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-30*

since its rwby themes you *could* slap a rwby logo on there

its not needed but might be nice

hmmm but you dont have access to an editor like illustrator or photoshoops tho right?

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

watch she made that on her phone.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

yaaaa naaaaah i used canva

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-30*

sheesh.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-30*

wooooo

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

listening to podcast/video on charging for photography: I really don't think doing prints only (no digital returns) is a valid business model anymore.

Like, you do the shoot and you come back, see the stuff, then you buy prints of that stuff you like.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

yeee

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

Do have to consider it outside of cosplay though. Cosplay is such a specific setup.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

oh well my dad got photos of our family a couple times

we always got them digital

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

that's the right example, yea.

I don't know the last time we had photos done.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*





OKAY here's my slides, feedback plz





Okie that's all of them

Then I just need to get all the prizes and take a pic <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

How many of your followers are likely to have a picture of the two of you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

Dats for mutuals, like y'all

The favorite pic of me is for people who aren't mutuals

Thought about that one ü§ì

That's all I need to be happy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

YA I included that because I don't wanna take it too seriously lol

And it's easy to print a meme

Tom wants to be there don't worry

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-30*

The main problem with that shoot is I had no idea when to pose initially

So I was just chillin

When suddenly

CHANGE POSE

*We we're posing?*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

Works for Ren tho LMAO

This is nice, I don't remember the last time I sat down to just practice make up with all the make up I have

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

Bill do you know off the top of your head, for some reason, what one of my best cosplay derp photos is

I'm doing the "the photoshoot vs me actually being me" challenge thing

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

uh... no.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

Okay figured it was worth asking

I'll just look through ya website in saltine cracker class

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

You don't derp too much. I know you did in Destiny shoot, at least.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

LOL yeah Ginny Liz totally fed into it

So I was likE HA GOOFING OFF

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

She's a fun one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

time to open every photoshoot ive done with bill ever

HOORAH

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

wonder what the count is at now.

If you want to do an out of cosplay one too, there should be a decent derp in last week's collection.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

idk i had a lot of tabs open but im whittling through the ones without derp photos

OH TRUE

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

Lemme know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

so many derps are in yang

y tho

https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4400/37292528265_e7f258a36a_o.jpg

also i forgot this photo but daw i look so pretty

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

the colors are so *bad* though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

idk i look good, all that matters to me :V

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

you are a thing with color.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

my face looks good :V

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

okay, discord preview looks worse than the actual image.

It's passable.

I need to go back through and re categorize the galleries too... multiple category makes links look stoopid.

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/private,/cosplay,/photoshoot/2018/03/14/Chain.html The triple category thing looks dumb as fuck.

OH WAITWHOOPS

I think I did it wrong.

I question your definition of a derp photo.

Mangaloo AND Jake made it into a cosplay magazine.

_continues to think Jake is a really cool dude whose vastly underappreciated_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

BIG MOOD

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

what is?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

JAKE NEEDS MORE LOVE

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

I've always liked him. I relate to him too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

ok so im shopping for belts for my fallout cosplay

https://www.amazon.com/Tactical-Hoanan-Military-Outdoor-Traveling/dp/B073TV3JFD/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1522698701&sr=8-8&keywords=tactical+belt+pouch+army

this one is convenient, holds a lot, and its reusable in real life ~~if i ever go out hiking or something~~

id have to get a waterbottle that looks old tho

to fit _the look_

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00168WQY8/ref=asc_df_B00168WQY85383661/?tag=hyprod-20&creative=394997&creativeASIN=B00168WQY8&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198072135009&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8100857677432018801&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9003734&hvtargid=pla-320946785021

or this one

which looks old timey and includes the waterbottle but no other pockets

if i get either or, ill probably sew on one more pouch

https://www.amazon.com/Hoanan-Pouches-Tactical-Military-Accessory/dp/B073RCFP8P/ref=sr_1_12?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1522698992&sr=1-12&keywords=hiking+pouch+army

for mah phone

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

it'd be harder to get an old fashion looking water bottle into the newer one than it would be to add an extra pouch to the old I'd think.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

yeah

though i like the look of the other one

and extra pouches so NO CON BAG WOO

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

~~Don't get rid of Hal so nonchalantly~~ üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

üò≠

the day hal makes his gundam cosplay i WILL carry his things for him

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

Ye

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

Well, according to the description the canteen isn't attached the the belt. You could buy both, then somehow get the canteen attached to the "tactical fanny pack".

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

Hmmm would a canteen and a water bottle pouch look dumb?

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

The water bottle isn't sewn into the fanny pack.



You use the strap on the right to hold the bottle in place, as far as I can tell.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

should i get it in army green or tan

leaning towards tan

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

Tan yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

HA.



SO FUNNY.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

HA. HAHA.

its cuz hes a virgo

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

Why is he so popular when he's so *dumb*.

*I should watch it, what are the odds I'd recognize someone being attracted to me, really? Low that's what.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*



Nani??? Me???? COOL TO PARTY??????

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

Nicu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-03*

i feel like i know that person
are they a homestuck

georgia you gotta take pictures of the con party bus

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

You can rent a party bus, but it's not the most cost effective option and con goers tend to lean towards cheaper.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-03*

party wagon

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

~~pulled by dirty laguz~~

Georgia moves on from us to being super famous with Mango-loo.

https://www.cnet.com/news/lightroom-adds-profiles-color-styling-tool-to-fine-tune-photos/ sweet. I knew about and use said feature.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

peter just messaged me asking if i wanted to do a funeral pyrrha shoot at zenkai

whaaa

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

pause i have a meeting.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

is funeral pyrrha a thing?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

alright, what's up?

I got 15 minutes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

peter suggested the idea of a pyrrha funeral photoshoot

for zenkai

Id just need a white dress kinda thing which is easy peasy and allows me to change out of armor at some point

but the premise is that everyone responsible for pyrrhas death is there

he also pitched the idea of getting a coffin??? idk how?????

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-03*

That would probably be easier in a off location shoot? At least the coffin part

I mean it's morbid as hell but you can rent them ~~sept you'll literally be laying where dead bodies have been~~

**Dave** - *2018-04-03*

It going to be a large enough area for a fire?

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

who the heck is Peter?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

ironwoof

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

Dave: Is that related to Steelwolf

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

still don't know what that is.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

I MEANT IRONWOOD

whoops

ironwoof im dying what kinda typo

anyways yeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-03*

Lmao ironwoof

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

hahahha

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

oh, Peter. He's not a photographer though.

Is he suggesting for you to put together?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

yee

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

more meetings, bbiab.

üò≠

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-03*

~~Jaune is there cause he feels responsible for not stopping Cinders arrow+letting pyrrha go fight her~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

peter said i should have jaune there üòè

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-03*

Also side note

I feel like Remnant funerals are super focused on armor or important possessions

like just as a comment, cause like when people die they return to dust like grimm, or least its seems that way

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

i guess a funeral is moot point then

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

paaaauuuuuseeeeee fucking meetings

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

Lmao

<:rip:369476083248267274>  glorious leader

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

So people wouldn't wear colorful armor to a funeral, so it would require different outfits. You'll barely be in stuff, because lying in a coffin.jpg. Not sure where would would at Zenkai to do it either.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

also ive decided i will rewear the shit out of the vault suit cause its coming along nicely

if armor pans out how i want it, its gonna be a good time

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

And more comfy than Pyrrha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

ALSO very true

so yeah sole survivor wont be relegated to just a sunday cosplay

its too nice for that shit

and in the same idea, slowly but surely im getting together a cosplay line up for the rest of the year that im happy with

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

Good luck with that. You can't resist RWBY shoots.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

oh no rwby is still the big kahuna

but im also getting sole survivor, erza, and lux done

also colossalcon: is there any point to actual cosplay

or is it basically swimsuit versions, thats it

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

people do both

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

but what should i plan _realistically_

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

<:rip:369476083248267274> Afina cosplay, killed by Georgias induction into league.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

oh no im goNNA DO AFRIN TOO

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

especially cause there were aldus ears in my basement!

we gotta do it as a squad now

just say the word

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

up to you, you can do all normal cosplays, you dont gotta do swimsuit if you dont feel comfortable with it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

i will have afrin done

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

some people only do normal

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

but am i gonna actually have time to change

like

what proportion of time is spent in the waterpark

what did YALL do

i wanna do swimsuit fallout but i dont wanna look like i copied labinnak üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-03*

Like half and half

No you won't.

She don't own fallout swimsuit cosplay

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

true

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

I forget what I did in the afternoon. Chilled mostly.

The drank at the water park late night Friday, and Saturday I ended up wanting about with Dan and Deedee to a room party.

Which I bailed on. It's a vacation con. I'm only going to camera up for shoots, that's it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-04*



Nani

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-04*

the eastern side of all of america
have fun cosplaying weiss in chile

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

I had the same thought though.

I mean, it's an odd request, and will likely end up being drama.

but if your curious...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-04*

mmm i dun like drama

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

but you could be a part of deca 2.0!

guess it would be different if you met at a con first.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-04*

üò¨

potential reward isnt worth the potential drama

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/steno/2018/04/02/flora-princeton.html I adapted a thing pros do for photoshoots instead of doing the old steno.

Also more people said I should post more often, but my backlog.

I only have a handful more from Katsu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-04*

Look at Kawaii maka Georgia. UwU

~~someone tag me in that cosplay story thing if you get it it seems interesting~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

We tag you all the time and you ignore them. üòè

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-04*

What
If someone tags you in a story are you notified of it because I only ever got the one selfie one from you I think

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

I alone have tagged you in multiple selfie games.

I‚Äôm being a choosey begger because no one seems interested in non cosplay stuff

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

It's not supposed to be in Cosplay. And you were going to a con the last time I tagged you with it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-04*

What is life if not cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

The thing you do the other 90% of the year.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-04*

What's the current cosplay story meme

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

First cosplay, favorite Cosplay, hardest Cosplay, cosplay to remake, and something else.

Georgia/Tyler/Meg have done it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-04*

I don‚Äôt have pictures of my first cosplay that might be an issue. I have pictures of my second somewhere.

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

And most recent.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-04*

What happens when all the answers are the same >w>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-04*

Or wait, are you saying you aren't sure what idea you have.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-04*

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

You realize no one but Hal will be at RTX.

No point in surprising us.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-04*

tbh i just dont know if i wanna put the effort to make it so i wanna decide first before i tell anyone

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

I promise I won't tell your adoring fanbase.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-04*

Jess tho if she played Dang Ron Paul

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

Are you in a colossal group or something? Like, Just colossal, not colossal east?



> tfw when your cosplay squad is actually Tom and Jess now.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-04*

:3c

Oh no

It better not be just them

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

And Hal, but Hal isn't a change.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-04*

Does anybody know if insta has a scheduled post function

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-04*

I wish

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-04*

Im too indecisive üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

wait, didn't you make a big doc of hashtags for posts on the way back from Katsu?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-04*

Yea that still doesn't help me pick a damn photo though

**Bill** - *2018-04-04*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-04*

Lol does doesn't anything for 3 weeks

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

I'm dead in this scenario, I don't really care. üòê



Aaaand there we go.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

Draaaammma

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Let's not get into a drama cycle okay folks?

We're heading into con season, no one has time for that.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-05*

Pfft

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

My finger's hovering over unfollow for Ethan tbh, let him stir drama outside of my view.

Do I think Reiley needed to provoke him no, but Reiley rarely posts and doesn't stir public drama as easily as other people breathe.

Ye, I'm done.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Unfollowed him?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Mhmm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

I mean he said "or someone that poses for photos"

We're not wrong

I ain't starting drama tho

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Not saying you're wrong.

There's no point arguing with him is all. Yes alpha, has to be right, and is willing to treat you like a piece of meat when he considered you a close friend. A passive aggressive story war isn't going to make him see the light. 

More importantly, I've been on the fence about him for awhile. He said what he said EXPECTING to stir up drama. I don't have time for people like that. It's not the first time, and won't be the last.

So he can do whatever he wants. I'm not giving him attention, opposition or support. He'll move to other people who actually care enough to listen to his opinions in short order.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

tru

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Mhmm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

still a dick tho

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Absolutely.

I'm merely not giving him attention for flaunting his tiny dick around.

(It tends to have a... *minimizing* effect on people who do that.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

yeah like he latched right onto what rei posted

starting drama means he gets attention

which he hasnt gotten since he pushed his friends away

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Mhmm. If you don't give him attention, he goes away.

It might not work as well for you, given people *like* you, but at he very least it'll keep you out of his messes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

also tru

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

In my case, I'm out of sight and out of mind, he'll forget I exist after awhile. Which sounds good to me.

You can't fix people. People can change, but you can't make them. So why get salty about them? Just don't involve yourself.

I dunno how many of BNE would be okay with that mentality though.

Noooot that I won't still enjoy the drama fest. Just from the outside.

I'm just glad no ones involved with him, in the business sense. Then I'd have to stick around to watch out for them.

Anyway, night.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-05*

so ethan messaged me



hmm those are out of order

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

what order is it in?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Oh Erik, give me s break from share for share hell. Davids is finally over with.

üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-05*

"create thin cosplay accessories and hairpieces out of spaghetti!"
yeah ok that works great until you go anywhere with a teensy bit of humidity then you have a nice decorative wet noodle

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

~~but you're already surrounded by wet noodles~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-05*

?



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-05*

Who's the first onee

The second is obviously Monika <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-05*

knees weak arms spaghetti <:lenny:395307171539189760>



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-05*

NYOOOM

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

I'm the Georgia now.

https://giphy.com/gifs/reactiongifs-rVZEejvVWEbug

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

It dun have to be spicy all the time! That photo makes my corset look hella lol

Gasp

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

~~But üå∂ ~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

trying to figure out what to wear next weekend

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

nothing that's a pain to wear all day.

Cause no hotel room.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

only think of mine thats a pain is 2B cuz shoes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

I think it'd be cool to see tom in Ren for sakura

Cause ~~watah~~ flowahs

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

yeee

should i still do nora then?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

yeeee.

Nora would be good for Sakura Sunday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

gotta fix ma shirt

and belt

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

oooh, you guys need to get Ren and Nora themed hoodies.

Gotta do hoodie juniper without Mr Small Dick.

*that's why the word juniper looks weird, I only write it as JNPR*

same goes for Halim.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

themed in what way? i mean Georgia's is just a red hoodie with stripes if i recall?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

True. Could just be a nice color pink.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Yeah

Switching Max to hoodie Pyrrha....

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

wait really?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Small Dick and Adult Child put the emblems on the backs though. I'll admit, was cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

yea thats not hard

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

also wait really?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

how big is kindacon?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

smol.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

like kotori sized? or smaller

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Kotori or smoller.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

hmmm ok

i should prrob do something easily recognizable

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

probably bigger than kogarafest, where you could see everyone's face during the fire alarm that went off.

Nora and 2B are both recognizable.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

i cant do 2b unless i bring spare shoes

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Nora then moar Nora?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

i have to see what tom wants to do too

na idk wanna do her 2 days in a row i need variety lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

I'd say hoodie JNPR for sakura sunday, but that's a waste of Ren's thematic regular outfit.

And you should sync with Tom, even if you aren't... together, together.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

Me: makes plans to crossplay but never does them RIP

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

what, MM?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

and Aldi and Drizzt

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

*low key hoping that when we watch Violet Evergarden Georgia is like "I'm cosplaying that"*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

id prob do MM frst cuz das cheep

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

_whistles conspicuously_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

??

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

it's a little short notice to do a new cosplay...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Do MM to kinda!

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

oh wait Prime shipping, if you can find all of MM online...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

~~is justin going?~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Nah he has work lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

damn lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

There IS the MM sweater on Amazon

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Hal know if he's working, or is going to be NRTH for the weekend?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

i could throw a MC cosplay together so fast XD RIP

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

> puts bangs in face
> starts texting

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

YEET

ill just be lonely MC

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

~~you're just texting your 5 boytoys~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

~~tom has 5 boyfriends, why can't she~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

YEA

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

sounds like you have a plan.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

me?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

yup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

for? kindacon adn sakura?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

yeaaaaah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

sakura prob gonna be renora i still dont know about kinda though

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

*All these question marks are making me doubt myself*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

toms been MIA so idk what hes feeling

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

*probably lost and confused*

Are you actually scrapping Max Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

*does the table 2 summoning dance*

Well Pyrrha doesn't have a particularly comfy outfit so

I'm not doing a full suit up

If they do hoodie renora I'm SUPER game

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

I'd tell you forget about it if you were going to armor up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

But if they do reg renora I don't know how to match exactly

So idk

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

for sakura? I mean i think rens outfits too perfect for sakura to do hoodie

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Yeaaaah that's a good point

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

It'd be a waste to do hoodie JNPR at sakura sunday, given Ren is a water flower.

As much as hoodie JNPR is üëå üëå üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

/sews together a red yukata

Jk I'm already gonna die getting fallout armor done

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

I don't doubt you could though.

ah, right, armor. The bane.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*



IM SO SAD ITS OUT OF STOCK

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

üò≠

http://e-shuushuu.net/images/2018-01-07-944109.png

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

lol yukata Pyrrha would prob look a lil off with regular ren and regular nora too. unless... yukata nora but meh

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

that'd be weird because Ren's dress in canon and the girls are AU.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

yea exactly

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*



actually eh on that one.

causal Pyrrha with canon Renora would be a tough sell.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Truuuue



Cute tho

But yeah I guess I should stay with Max then

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

there will be other chances for Hoodie JNPR.

And we'd only be talking NPR, last I checked.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Hals not sure

I'll figure it out with him tonight

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

o7

I DID figure if he decided something he'd share.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Yeah so I'll keep Max for Sakura

Unless Hal is comin and suggests otherwise

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

u has a chloe? or just max

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Just max

Reiley has the chloe cosplay but isn't comin

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

oooo okey dokey

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Jess:



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

what?

y tho?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

You played LiS right? would you chloe?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

I think Jess mentioned Kate before

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

oh tru.

Also, Fem!Jaune?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Huh

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Is that "Huh" as in "I forgot I cosplay that" or "Huh" as in "I didn't think of that".

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

ooh yea i love kate üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

~~Too bad Kate doesn't love Kate~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Oof

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

hahaha yea

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Now to get the bois to be Nathan and Warren

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

~~who?~~ XD

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Warren was the cool nerdy guy *THEY NEVER LET YOU TELL ABOUT YOUR TIME TRAVEL POWERS CAUSE GAY SHIP THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS*, Nathan was main jock.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

Warren deserved better tbh

And Nathan was poophead yeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

lmao im kidding

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-05*

sakura sunday is next sunday ya?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-05*

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

I wasn't answering you, I just wanted to yell about *GAY SHIP BEING THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-05*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-05*

hmmm
So I might not have off saturday, but I should have off on one of the weekends

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

Monica is looking for a group of RWBY cosplayers, but doesn't ping BNE?

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

for what?

**Bill** - *2018-04-05*

dunno. Two people asked in comments.

see instagram.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-05*

ah

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-05*

yeah I saw that

she wants like a bunch of people who BNE definitely has,

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

she's not the organizer so she might feel awkward saying "I have a bunch of these" but.



Calm down Instagram, I'm not a weeb today.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

not TODAY

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

that's what today implies.

*As I listen to the violet evergarden OST.*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-06*

omg biru when did you do a violet evergarden cosplay
who'd you cosplay? violet??

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

üôÑ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-06*

oh, Forte?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-06*

I like the Pokemon snap meme

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-06*

Smashes that a button

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-06*



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-06*

~~is that ryan~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

*probably is though*

We moved the princeton shoot to sunday, so now I've got saturday afternoon mostly free...

I was going to be in princeton (and I'll still pass through there) so I had the thought of seeing if Leanna was around...

But like, two people who suck at small talk alone seems like a bad idea.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

This Saturday?

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

Mhmm. Was going to short Flora, now I'm doing it sunday afternoon on my way up from Rowan instead.

we're still not even decided for sakura either cuz tom mentioned yukata yato

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-06*

but yukata yatos all gloomy

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

tru.

~~Instead be emotionless Ren~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

> Tom is all :/ when Jess and Justin are doing MM
> Tom disppears when we get to Kinda
> Jess and Justin are stopped for a picture
> Tom shows up as Jumin 
>Jumin sweeps MC off her feet into a deep kiss
> "Sorry Seven, but I can't let her go."
> Marisa's nose starts bleeding
> Justin's like "Yea bro sure???"
> Jess is like üòç

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

*I have no one to impress so I'll just use my wild ideas to set the bar higher for everyone else, MUHAHAHA*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-06*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-06*

My schedule next week seems to be leaning towards not working on Sunday

So I can show up Saturday night after work and hang on Sunday, which if I remember is cherry blossom day?

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-07*

You could prolly just safety pin it!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-07*

YOU KNOW TABBY AND NEUF

brave photoshoot leader. pioneer of photoshoots everywhere.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

YA I WAS IN TABBYS HOMESTUCK PANEL ONCE

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-07*

"where are they now: famous homestucks edition"
so many have been dormant. tabby is like irl indiana jones. ceri used to be super active but I haven't heard from her on tumblr or facebook except for once in a blue moon.

was that the kotoricon panel? :3c

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

Nahhh it was a minicon



Gonna have to trim this big boi but AY LUX WIG ARRIVED

I'm honestly half tempted to use this one for Star and order a shorter one in the same color for Lux

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-07*

You don't have a wig for star? Or you do this ones just better?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

I do but this one is way better

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-07*

Oooo ok yea it look nice

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-07*



Holy tediousssssss

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

YAY JESS YOU DID IT

Also holy balls wig clean out is tedious

I threw out three because they smelled weird or were tangled

Two I've saved for later

One is my old Pyrrha wig that maybe Hal can use for Male Pyrrha lol

And ONE is okay for sale

Thus far

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-08*

I actually allready had everything soooo free cosplay? And whooo for organizing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*



Sometimes I'm like why do I own some of these

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-08*

What did you buy it for?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-08*

So lux has straight hair so I agree that you could order a new one and use that for star

Not that it wouldn't work regardless

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

Oh yeah I could straighten and cut the long one but it's just so nice I don't wanna destroy it

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-08*

yeaaa

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*



Aight I got all my wigs together that I like and will continue using

_the house is out of breakfast food_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

You lost The Game

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

cant believe tom is doing actual work

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

hes not. hes avoiding questions

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

/whispers aside

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

that should do it

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

then cosplay what you want?

~~Or constantly message and pester him till he decides it's less work to just do the thing than to ignore it.~~

You know, the Billy ‚Ñ¢

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

the answer to that depends on his answer though

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

and that usually ends up with ME answering the thing for both of us, which doesnt work in this case

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

cosplay 707 and assume he'll figure somethin out

when the mens dont answer, you just gotta assume

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

The advice I'd toss out doesn't really apply so...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

~~tho Hal usually answers~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

~~he cant be mad at ALL of us~~

cant be mad at you, youre his wifey

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

~~I'll just message sussex chibi until he's more mad at me~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

cant be mad at me, im the other half of table 2

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

It'll work.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

cant be mad at bill, bill is too good for this earth

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*



Look at this passive aggressive reveal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

is she throwin shade at you?

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

god no.

I'm only salty cause I reached out twice and she never answered either.

This is someone else she's apparently making a big todo about.

Don't be passive aggressive in a way that can hit people you don't want to be PA too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

oooo ok

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

come on.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-10*

She needs a chill pill

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

I've seen vents before from her, but never will such a passive aggressive bent to them.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BhZdO9fgVBm/ I definitely ship the fuck out of it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

yeaaaaaaa

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

That's the photo of someone who cares about Casey the girl, not Labinnak the star.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

well yea

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

I low key want to ship Rebecca and Erik a bit.

"I nominate Erik fill the husband spot Rebecca. You need more tol in the family and Matt's already a brother. Besides, you guys are classic trio."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

*who is sheee*

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Bat Goddess Cosplay. She was at Zenkai last year as Weiss. She asked me for a Mizore shoot at Katsu which I did.

Friends with Mark I think, much like how Erik was.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Problem is you aren't blond the rest of the time. Dye your hair blond, *somebody* will get used to it, and will be satisfied when you go non blond for teh cosplays.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-10*

blonde curly hair looks stupid af

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-10*

It's the only gag one I capped though.

**Bill** - *2018-04-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-12*

**Bill** - *2018-04-12*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-12*

I seriously think he just doesn't want either of them

**Bill** - *2018-04-12*

I expect a swift boot to the head if i‚Äôm like that.

My theory, not the not wanting part.

He really seemed to like Lanie though? He was going to meet up with her just to say good bye Sunday of Katsu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-13*

i did a tutorial for that peeled skin makeup effect during a speech class because I presented on halloween, and in that class we had to pick 2 people to critique during their speech as an assignment. the next time everyone chose me but I was talking about police brutality oops

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-13*

Not as fun

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*



What's so interesting about page 6 of the cosplays? ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/cosplay/page/6/index.html

~~Most of the traffic is probably me.~~

not that I care, I'm not looking for major traffic or anything.

Instagram is the primary thing I use for engagement.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

yeah idk

probably everyone accessing konkon photos?

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

in the last 7 days?

ACTUALLY yes, from those collage posts.

Maybe.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

ye exactly

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Meg's wasn't from me tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

~~low key nervous for crossplay~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

why?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

i dont exactly know? i guess cuz its new for me

how be man? XD

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

If I was feeling creative this morning I'd create "Ethan's Guide to Being Savage as Fuck" but eh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

D:

be a man = be savagee?? üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

~~You could be a sad boi like me~~

That would fit Seven better I suppose.

Or just be Tom: More interested in video games than surroundings.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

I have to be sad meme boi

"im sorry you are not high enough friendship level to access my tragic backstory"

also dabbing. all the dabbing

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

~~Dab to hide the tears~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

wear heelies to escape your feelies

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

~~What if you couldn't use heelies~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

build a wall of memes to hold back all your feelies

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

eeeeeh that wouldn't work.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

~~das what seven do tho~~

and buys sports cars

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

~~Seven is a fake boi tho~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

but thats the boi im trying to be! which was the whole point of us starting this conversation

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Well, it sounds like you know exactly what he does then. Just do what you told me. üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

lol how i pose as a man

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Uh. Honestly, don't think about it too much. There's A LOT more posing guidance for women than men. Guys just kinda stand there and do real basic stuff. Shoulders back kinda basic.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

but shoulder back mean my titty stick out more

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

fold arms be cool kid

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

I can't help you not be a woman. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

But guys and posing is pretty much just... exist.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

ooo yea das prob a good idea.

also i wasnt specifically asking *you* billy XD

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

I assume you mean wasn't?

yup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

yea üòµ

anyway yea so im unreasonably nervous  ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

You know I express the fact that I care about people through endlessly trying to help them solve their problems. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

this isnt exactly a problem that needs fixing tho XD

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

*aaaaand that'd stop me?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

~~i just want encouragement~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

You have nothing to worry about?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

yes, that. Just do that.

Remember, the fans of MM are girls. They get it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

very true

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

!counter drankaloos add 1

There's a cosplay I really like but recently all she posts about is patreon

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

rip.

See Gen was like 'would you support me on patreon?'

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

üò¨

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

I almost hit no.

Just because I don't like Patreon Girls ‚Ñ¢.  She doesn't need the stigma.

Does a story and post about the same thing count as one of two drankaloos?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

Nah two

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

!counter drankaloos add 1

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Damn, how much time did you spend outside?

That looks awesome though. Can't believe you did it in a week.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

Idk I walked between class and sat outside eating for like 25 mjns

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Wow.

You should like, never wear tang tops.

If it's any consolation, Katy burns like that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

It's better than a farmers tan lol



Whoopee

It's messy but it should be and I have to weather everything anyways which will cover it up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

üëå

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

Heckin sweet.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

And now I'm taking a pizza bagel break and then it weathering time

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

Still gotta sew the collar too orz ignore that

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

Y'all gunna die tho. It was hot today.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Ok that should help

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Which I thought would be a problem

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

=DDD

_picks up old DSLR, the 3300._

How the *fuck* did I use this so much? it's so ***small***.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-14*

DIRTY STINKY ARMOR

(Plus blood!)

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

found a use for the blood did you.

boy do I like that symbol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Thank I had to do it in three parts cause of its complexity

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

how much left to do?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Gotta weather one more arm piece, sew on the collar, add the little health apparatus they have on the top corner, put on the 111 and then reinforce seams ONE MORE TIME just to be sure

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

that sounds like a lot. Do try and get some sleep tonight.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

just finshed weathering

and eh not that bad

the only thing that might suck is putting 111 on

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

Fight-o!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Took a slushie break while paint dries

Then I just gotta slap some sewing together

Then DONE

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

Amazing.

Astounding!

Well it‚Äôs alright I guess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Mmm I'm feeling the burnout

I only reinforced half the seams, still have to sew on the collar, and the 111

Break time tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Yea! Cuz I need a zip up hoodie anyway and I have no fandom hoodies at all so it's like 3 purposes at once

I gotta ask Justin where he got his cuz it nice and accurate and alot of the ones I see arent accurate

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

Ya a year ago all the ones on eBay were off-canon. Nooo. 
I think there‚Äôs a fandom company that might sell good ones? I can‚Äôt recall hmm

Something like welovefine or a similar company

Someone posted a pattern once on tumblr too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Oooo neato. Yea I liked the one I had today. The other seven's hoodie only had one small circle on the shoulders and I was like <:triggered_cinder:389869499597455390>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

707 would buy knockoffs if his hoodie. He‚Äôd sell knockoffs of his own hoodie.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Oh that's true

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

i bought an unknown pin today and i was like "if i pay 2 dollars for my brother, will he love me?"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

No but it‚Äôs the thought that counts <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

the artist seemed to find it amusing <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Georgia and Tom confused me today cuz they were talking about play by post Rica but i thought they were talking about RIka and i was like "huuuh?"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

They must fight. Rica vs rika

I have a friend named rika who I also got into mystic mess but her name is Rita I just called her rika for years so she‚Äôs safe from the battle. For now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

oh man

i think if my name was rika id cry

i told like 4 people to play MM today. i am trash

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

i got a girl i was tutoring into it and once during a tutoring session she was like "can we take a break I have a new chatroom" and i was like yes pls me too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

WAIT REALLY?!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

ya mine had opened like 10 minutes prior and i was itching to get to it but i was like 'no don't' because she was really serious
but she had her priorities straight üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

yooo did you fangirl it up?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

YA she always played on silent so when I was mentioned liking seven's music she was like "wat"

background music

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

she came to visit recently because she's moving to japan this summer ~~and left her luggage at my house <:lenny:395307171539189760> ~~ and I asked her how the mystic mess was, she grinded for hourglasses to unlock Another Story and bought it but is too hesitant to play it <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

That's amazing tho üòÇ

I wanna play it! I just don't know who's route to go first

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

***DO IT***

i would say do V's route first because his came out first, but it's really hard not to get on Ray's route because he's so attached to you from the start

whereas V is like "rika is everything"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

üò≠üò≠ I could use a walkthrough I guess. I kinda feel like I should do vs first

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

first 4 days of V route

But like after watching the secret ends all I wanna do is save saeran üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

V's route might destroy you so if you want to save Saeran ~~best for last?~~ do V first

PLUS RAY'S ROUTE HAS SUCH A CLIFFHANGER AT THE END

GIVE US THE REST OF THE STORY CHERITZ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Noooooo üò≠ but yea I was thinking the whole best for last thing too and also v was released first. I mean I wanna save v too but üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

solution: buy 7 phones so you can do everyone's route at once

i googled something and a picture of tiny jumin on the phone popped up that picture is my favorite in the entire game it's so funny

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

The one where he's on the phone? As a baby boi?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

yeah the backstory is pure gold

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Yea! I can't wait to get context on that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

vroom vroom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Couldn't drive then can't drive nowb

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

"hello, tiny driver kim? it's me."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Omg üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*



seven drives jaehee around in some of the routes so i guess she's smart enough to stay away

shoulda tied zen to the car with his own hair

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Lmaoooo noooooo üòÇ

Hope he don't drive like that with mc

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

when MC's in the car: perfect officially licensed chauffeur with extensive training
when zen's in the car: "lol wanna see if i can make this u turn going 250"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Probably

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

**Dave** - *2018-04-16*

Do high heels come in a mens size 12?

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

ya have you ever seen the musical kinky boots

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

they were handing out contracts for this at animate the other day
like kyubey but the yakuza

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

hmmm should i keep my red wig for 707 and get another wig to style for Lilith? I feel like Lilith's hair is straighter and doesn't have all those little stick up parts on the top

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

ye mebbe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

I think I might do that. I think that wig works well enough for 707? I might style it  a lil tho

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

gotta be able to cos 707 at any time.

Need two wigs.

clearly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

well yea i wasn't saying not have 2 different wigs I'm just wondering which character to use the one i already have for

i think that one might too short for Lilith

I think it works better for 707

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

ya know as much as i slam mangoloo for being so distant and professional from her followers

shes got to have guys crawling after her half the time so i get it

and i definitely feel that want to _not_ be approached on facebook

i get rouge friend requests on my personal from time to time and im not really keen on having my followers interact on pictures posted with my family or college

thats for like, friends

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

yea i get that

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

which is normal even if you don't have 3k followers.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

I technically have 13 cosplays lol wut(if you include swimsuit,  PJ  and casual versions and all that)

<@!245270932602486784>  what body paint should i buy again? both for raven and lilith? ben nye? snazaroo?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

so theres pros and cons to both

my recommendation is ben nye

but its oil based, and a little more spence

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

the cake one?

dis?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

coo

is v. opaque?

<@!351785752197201920>  im droppin mad cash later on cosplay supplies fair warning

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

üò± üò± üò±

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

its thicc ye

snazaroo is water based and cheaper

but that means its easy to sweat off

but if you have oily skin already itll clog your pores

^^ben nye

ben nye is oil based so it can clog pores

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

yeee the ben nye seems like $12.50 a cake. itll prob kill my skin, but RIP

ihave combination skin

so its dry and oily at the same time üéâ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

whoaaa

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

ye is lotsa fun

mmkay so i think my lineup is gon' be Nora, Lilith, and Seven (unless toms doesn't finish Leo) WOOT for red haired characters

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

Mine is leo and Ren, no idea what the third day will be

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

So maybe Ren and Nora, Leo and Seven (whats my gender again?) on Saturday and 2b and 9s on sunday (or switch those two idc) or maybe double up on one of those days idk

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

Could do Seven for an evening cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

RAVE SEVEN

ye dat true he comfy boi

Lilith and Nora are comfy too tho

2b would be if heels didnt exist

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

does zenaki even have a rave?

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

It does.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

i imagine its not that great üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

We didn't go last year can't say.

But I might check it out. Next has been the only con to rave at, but I like everything else about Zenkai.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

*raves as seven*
*actually passes out*

hows the formal there?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-17*



**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

A violet Evergarden group needs to happen so Tom can cosplay Benedict.



Guess why.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

Screw Ren height boost, you need Benedict ~~shoes~~ heels.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

tom: "oh no, he's hot"

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

Tom does have a husband after all.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

~~i mean unless its dave~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

I'm just saying Tom would be a heckin Benedict.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

~~ok but who can i be~~ XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

Violet?

But yeah once I get my Leo wig it would fit him

And thank

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

She gets shipped with Benedict a little bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

kawaii

wheres the strong armored redhead for me :V

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

No redheads.

Cept the one guy.



If you did Violet, Hal could do the major, who for some weird reason I think would really work for Hal.



The sole redhead.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

owo is she main character

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

Violet?

The blonde?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

Yeah, main character. Violet Evergarden.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

yeeeet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

~~silently laughs cuz tom mentioned me as violet first but main character automatically goes to georgia~~

~~not like ive even seen it so it doesnt matter anyway~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

Cosplay Violet if you want to?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

YE JESS YOU CAN DO IT

kiss tom in any cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

It's *my* opinion, it doesn't even matter?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

i havent even watch it yet lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

Tom is the only one I had a lock for anyway, though Major!Hal is quickly growing on me.

Then I aligned the ships.

Again, my opinions, invalid.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

tom aint gon wear heels anyway lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

True

I'd prob modify it to be boots

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

ive probably gained and dropped like 10 follows in the last 24 hours so i keep wavering around 3200

thats probably all the stinky diaper babies that dont like my fallout cosplay tho so good riddance

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

Lmao who wouldn't like fallout thouf

Is that possible

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

STUPID people probably

**Dave** - *2018-04-17*

Joker junkrat strikes again

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-17*

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

naaaah you'll be fine.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

In one way, I'm proud to hear whenever the garritys are working on cosplay

But in another, I become this old man smoking a pipe, being all "don't become like me, kids"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

Gotta finish leo, how.will I ever NCR ranger if I don't finish leo <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

Wait is that a thing you are doing for reals?

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

what's going to make them feel old is calling them "The Garrity's."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

Tru

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

Tru lmao

And not sure yet, it's on my list as something I'd like to do

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

OOOP NCR RANGER YEAHUH

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*



dis bitch casually insulting photographers.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

theyre assuming all the photographers arent good enough?

**Bill** - *2018-04-17*

what it looks like to me.

Pretty sure Foxx is also a photographer too, and apparently some kind of elitist from everything I see them say.

Only tangentially related, but I'm thinking of unfriending Grey's account. I don't want facebook/internet only friends, we've never connected at a con, I've reached a couple times to shoot (since apparently it's the only way I can make friends now) and got no reply. It's just stupid. 

I may need to play at being more outgoing to make friends and meet people (everyone can't be a Georgia who comes looking for you), but I feel like this case is a waste of time. Being ignored period is going to turn me off to you.

I was going to say it's stupid to be concerned about a facebook account, but clearly I put value into people I friend. That justifies it I suppose.

,...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-17*

yeah maybe

at least we'll always be your facebook friend AND your real friend billiam <33333

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

I'm doing a sleeve paint, wish me luck fam üò±

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

Good luck fam

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

It's not terrible?

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

Looks good from here.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

~~it does look good he's just being overly perfectionist~~

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

preach about frienships!!! <@!184437198865563648>

(yes i lurk in the dark occassionally hehe)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

and yeah I agree with Grey, she doesnt feel like a friend in the slightest

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

idk this person, but yes, if the person is only there for you when its convenient for them or they want something, get out. They arent a friend and they might do more harm than good

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

it's not like we ever were friends, beyond a couple facebook comments.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

Oh pft then no debate; bye bye person lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

I'm more giving up on trying to become friends in the first place, despite Grey seeming to be an interesting person.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

ah gotcha

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

Why (explicitly) try making friends, it never really works.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

I disagree on that regard

Grey just seems like a distant person

and is kinda a drama queen with some things

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

Explicitly trying to make friends does work. Just works with people that matter imo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

yeah i guess its more along the lines of "hey I met this person and they seem nice so ill pursue friendship"

rather than "lemme try to make friends with everyone"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

true. like if youre goal is just to make friends with everyone who seems cool or that you like, explicitly going out of your way might not work. There's always gotta be that willingness from the other person to be friends too (which friendship can appear in many forms too)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

yeah absolutely if they dont want it theres no trying

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

precisely haha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

henlo fwens I made a logo for cosplay to use on a business card plz gives me your input I did the ? cuz of the WHO is whoozica but maybe i should do something different?

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

Willingness from other people is far and few between for some of us.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

I mean ive been out of touch with the cosplay scene for a quite some time, so im not sure how the community is. But like still, there should be some ounce of desire or willingness for friendship back. Not just desire for photos or like getting stuff

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

I usually only share the dramatic stuff, Grey posts other stuff. (just for reference, I'm not trying to defend person I barely know.) One prop was thursday night she was like 'hey you!' from across the room but I didn't recognize her immediately. /shrug

But that does not makeith friendships.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

<@!351471675843411978> Ready for college peer review again

lmao

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

<@!351471675843411978> I think you need an owl motif.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

Owls go who

why didnt i think of that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

YEET dont forgot your complement sandwiches kids

ooo yea that would probably be a good idea actaully

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-18*

omg

communication 101

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

the first thingy is the text is supppper skinny

Andrew George voice: "I'd like to see a bit more width on that text so it doesnt strain my eyes"

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

(remember discord's image previews distort the image a little)

But I'd agree. Twig font.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

okey dokey

color?

~~i did this in like 10 mins on a whim~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

Do you really like pink, or did you run with Nora colors?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

kinda picked it at random?

alot of my cosplays have pink or red

so i picked a reddish pink

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

I'd say it's a little flat feeling, but that might not be the color itself.

Pink works though, as long as it isn't neon and an eyesore. I just wanted to be sure you weren't only using Nora to define it. üëç

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

flat colors are sort of the trend in logos right now but its a thing to consider, mmkay imma work on it more

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

What I mean is the whole thing is kind of flat? Like, it's just there?

I'm not good at describing this.

Like you want one thing that adds some contrast or pop to the image so it draws the eye.

something like that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

yea maybe cuz i designed it on the business card. anyway, back to the drawing board

cuz the card design has other elements on it. i like the owl idea tho

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

Yeeee, that'd be neat.

Still minimalist, but very clearly birb.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

yeeee ill prob have to wait till i get home to work on it more cuz meeting and then ill probably be crazy with work

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-18*

Gaining so many and losing so many followers is so annoyinggg

Why am I losing followers, _what have I done_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

Evil Georgia is running a counter campaign against you

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

People are likely only following you for a day or two to enter the contest and then they unfollow you.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

Anyways Jess I think wat Billiam meant is that there wasnt enough Contrast, the ? was small and there werent any other elements around it

I think an Owl with like.... a bow that took up more space would be better for sure

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

ooo is nice you should copyright it

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

O.o?

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

speaking of bow bows...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-18*

~~Marisa has wares if you have coin~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

<w<

Sudden inspiration to draw marisa as a khajitt

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

it's a place called Carnival of Collectibles, like a flea market but permanent. they rent out booths by month so BoJo and I split one. she sells her antique sewing machines and sewing stuff and I sell bows and dolls and cheap stuff I find from China ~~but not so many dolls recently because they take up a lot of space to mail back~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

Ah how often do they set up? and do you have like a catalogue too so people can order them?

you'd probably super benefit from a etsy tbh

if you could keep up with the demand ofc

Maybe once you are out of skewl you could do that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-18*

Toms tryna be your business advisor

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

it's always there I think they're open every day except monday? it's cool because people don't need to man the booth, you just put your booth number on the price tag and they ring everything up together at the front of the store.
YEAH i wanna do an etsy but I hear their startup fees are ridiculous with little exposure

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

Oh nicuuu

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

the only downside is there's a lot of theft of little items. bobbins and stuff would get stolen from the machines, I put my bows in big plastic bags with string price tags to prevent people from stickin' 'em in their bags

omg there's a yard sard next month those days you can make bank
i dunno why seeing as this place is always open but they advertise yard sales and a lot more people come for the exact same stuff
come on down
https://www.carnivalofcollectables.com/

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

the fees are 6.5% + 0.45 USD and 20more cents every 4 months per listing

took a quick look

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

do you have an etsy :0

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

start up is fine

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

ooooooo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

start upis free*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

there used to be a bow shop I used before I started making my own, they closed down temporarily but never reopened it sad. they were on storenvy

I also have keychains in the store. I heard my pokemon ones sold out because BoJo didn't know how to put the rest together. which was weird because those didn't sell at all at first, they sat for like 2 months and then I did a special where you got a free keychain if you bought a Pokemon pillow (they were like. neck pillows? cylinders with blue pikachu fabric and the ends were pokeballs made of thick fleece) and those went really fast

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

ah its in Phili

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

and korok ones. i wonder how those are doin i should ask
naw it's in jersey it's like 10 minutes away from Kotoricon i think

~~all of south jersey is philly~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

You guys are really money smart, its impressive üëå

yeah its a ~~3.5hr drive~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

has sale for keychains
*spends $40 on materials to make my eyebrows blue*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

thats different its hobby stuffs, plus you get a lot of stuff on sale

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

i bought another haruhi costume yesterday. the shame.
but my other one is literally 10 years old so maybe it doesn't fit anymore. maybe.

i bring keychains to next con 4 everyone
4 free
i hear the korok ones aren't selling rip maybe because most of the customers there are older people and don't know what they are

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

OoO

YAHAHAA

so is bojo going to zenkai without you?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

YAHAHA

ya can you believe her omg she's running the gong show AND the charity auction without me

but that might be good because if she wasn't running the charity auction she'd be buying everything in it

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

Yeah thats kinda nuts xD and ALSO TRUE

~~EVERYONE FIND MARISAS MOM~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

oh trust me you can not miss her <:lenny:395307171539189760>
you will hear her from a mile away

LITERALLY she might do that thing where she holds the charity bucket and goes up and down the lines outside of the dealers room hustling for money

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

I think i'd recognize her even tbhou ive only met herr twice and she prob doesnt remember me yeet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

omg when did you meet BoJo
OH YEAH konkon right

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

yeee

~~The day I realized that Bojo was your mom~~

Its probably hard to keep track of your friends since

they look different every time

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

i think they made her the head of a security team for some reason, but I'm like 99% sure that security team is for the dealer's hall so she'll mostly be around there. yelling at people to donate to charity.

ESPECIALLY IN COSPLAY

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-18*

^^^^

"Oh hey your marisas mom! You probably have no idea who i am but hello"

maybe shed remember billiam?

since he always looks pm the same

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

LMAO HE COLLAR IS STUDDED

WHAT AN EDGELORD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

he probably sprays it with like 5 cans of starch to make that studded collar stand up. hand-bedazzled

there's an anime like that. what is it. the main edgelord is shown lovingly hand-piercing his leather jacket.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

oh he fancy

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*



Photo from Reddit, do they not look... awkward if not down right uncomfortable to anyone else?

**Dave** - *2018-04-18*

The mercy looks like she needs to take a dump

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

Widow's going to jump the guy with the camera in a hot second.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

guys which cosplay(s) should i put on my business cards?

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

~~photos from The Little Things We Miss~~ Your favorites obviously.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

is it weird to have couple photos on your business card tho?

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Can't say I ever looked at the pictures on people's cards. I just look for the Instagram handle and move on.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

I'm partial to the single picture motif, which I have on my card and use for posts on Instagram. Georgia has single image cards I believe as well, though I don't think I ever got one. üòõ

Too much is too busy. But single image for Cosplay kinda implies that one cosplay is your thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

yea i was thinking either a few different ones or multiple on one. but i think i need a nora one and i dont have any solo images of nora so id have to do a couple pic

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Do you want to order them for Zenkai?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

yea. i can always print them at home too tho

like print a few for zenkai, then get the pics of solo nora and order later

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Yeah. The catch is you don't want to order too many cards you won't end up using. Printing your own sounds not fun at all tho.

You could make a couple card with both your information? That you can do now and do solos later, though you might not need them.

~~Unless you want to get cosfamous without Tomukun~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

nah print your own is p. easy you can fit 10 on a page

tom says he doesnt care about instagram anymore so???

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Lol.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-19*

I mean i care about instagram I just dont care to be cosfamous in any respect

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Even so can do the couple card thing. Helps to remind people you married and you can avoid some steelwolf types.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

i just want the card cuz ive had people ask for my insta and it'd be alot easier to just hand that out

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Yeet.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

just, if i do the couple card thing i have to change my whole design RIP

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Well.

We could try to do some Nora before Zenkai.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

yea idk when to squeeze it in though cuz i have alot to get done before zenkai

üò≠

ill figure something out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

Tom doesn't care about Insta fame?

~~gotta find a new Ren :V~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

like he enjoys cosplay but as far as getting followers he doesn't care?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-19*

i didnt mean i dont like it,

i just mean trying for it isnt on my to do list

Yo that pearl on point though

I think I'm most impressed with her

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

ya pearl cosplays in general are rare

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

Guess who just bought a 9s costume üôå

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

You?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

BIRU

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Like that cross play life huh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

Noooo Tom

Lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Nice.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

Yea I'm gonna be 9s and Tom's gonna be 2b

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Oh really?

Tom going to have leg for days?

So now Georgia needs to order a beacon uniform and we've ordered all the things. ~~Unless you two also do uniform JNPR~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

I already do got legs for days

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

(Not for Zenkai, but uniforms sounds like a really good 'plans fell through, rainy day and minimal effort' cosplays to have on hand)

Says the not cosplayer.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

Now weather this comes in time for zenkai is totally up in that air but ü§∑

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

Was trying on my jacket while wearing purple pants

Jess laughed and was like "are you Elfriede"

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Leo jacket?

Why is it so cooooold

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

rebecca just joined this event

interesting

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

mhmm, saw that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

SPITS NEVERMIND MONEY

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

expensive.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

75 for photographers, 50 (with 25 back) for models w h y

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

rental fee most likely.

course, there's nothing to say the organizer isn't making money of it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

OH FUCK ME UP THO sole survivor would look rad and theres a silver shroud going

o wow theres dynamic duchess as salem

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

is that a cosplay event? ü§î seems more like a modelling whatchamacallit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

üëÄ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

üëÄ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

yeah people are posting cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

It's a mix.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

yea it seems kinda like just a general "cool place to take pics" thing like all these people are gonna show up in costume and people are gonna be like "wtf"

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

I'll follow it, but 75 is expensive, and I can't figure why it's more expensive for one side than the other.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

yea i was thinking that too?

and only models get money back?

maybe they assume the photoags are being paid byt the models to shoot there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

yeah ill mark interested to see what comes of it



fuck thats too cool for sole survivor tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

the organizer's page doesn't have any cosplay on it it's all real models hehehe
I would pay to see the reaction of cosplayers showing up to a modelling event owo
maybe it's like a "you can use this for your portfolio and i'll use this for mine" kind of thing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

georgia watch out toms allready on his way to you close all your tabs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

_but im shopping for clothes_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

nice tabs

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Normal modeling is more likely to involve paid models than photographers though. Photographers use the pictures later.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*



red is clothes, blue is the thirst zapper pdf, brown is which game of thrones episode i was on

gray is class notes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

he dont care he'll close em all

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

people who want to break into modelling professionally usually need to hire photogs for their portfolios and get a decent bit of experience before anyone will be like "hey we'll hire you as a model"

tom closes class notes
<:rip:369476083248267274>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

i cant tell you how many times he borrowed my computer for something and closed all my tabs and been like "opps"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

*tom that was the solution to world peace*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

hmmmm would 2b fit that location or is it too creepy?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

HENLO LET ME IN

I NEED TO CLOSE YOIR TABS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

OOF 2 hr drive and $100 down though ouch

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

it's expensive, yes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

First time event charging a premium. There's a reason I didn't share it when I saw it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

yeeee

not that cool location photos wouldnt be awesome but its iffy

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

we can find location photos elsewhere.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

get arrested for the cosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

needs me a sweet abandoned warehouse

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

So we find one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

2b would be fitting in my opinion

and yeah thats a good point

_but damn a silver shroud is going_

its just SO fallout

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

*He's not even that good*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

thats cause silver shroud is objectively easy

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

2B needs more industrial than gothic.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

omg heather is cosplaying league on saturday of zenkai

/bangs out star guardian lux in 16 days

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

wow. shit. I meant Devola.

We'd need a popula, but Georgia would like Devola, not popula.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

~~guess we'll just have to wait till she plays the game and see if actually wants to cosplay any of them~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

Def not lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

I mean, I dig the duffel I bought after getting back from Canada, but it's just a bag.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

~~it's more like I want to make the money where I can decide to get luggage when I need it~~

Though my mom got me a luggage set with gyro wheels 5ever ago

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

when you start doing sales you'll be able to do that. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

Orz don't remind me, sales are scary

My mom offered a different opportunity with less pressure and slightly less money but I still need to talk to her bout it

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

you wanted to do that though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

I want da money, I don't wanna be aggressive car salesperson :c

Do I look aggressive, the answer is no

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

faaaair.

You'd just make everyone like you so much they'll buy a car a from you.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

Cold ask for luggage for a holiday <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

He's a prince of Hell or something like that.

and Star's ex. You never see characters with ex's, which is one of my favorite things in the show thus far.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-22*

Woooooo

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

Tom's future cosplays:
Tom *(From Mystic Messenger)*
Tom *(From Star)*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-22*

Except tom isn't like tom at all

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

Of course not.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-22*

üò±

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

He's not like Mystic Messenger Tom either.

But you have to cosplay characters with the same name as you right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-22*

Lmao I'm not sure mystic messenger Tom has a personality

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

sssssh it's fine.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-22*

Tom in Star is kinda selfish

He gets better, still kinda edgy tho

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

*He's a dick*

hence the love/hate. He makes for good episodes, but he kinda a dick.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-22*

Wow, that mean I not selfish. Thank <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-22*

Look to be on my phone at least? Unless I'm not seeing the better download option.

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

Not that much of a difference.

They're not perfect photos to begin with, and they're at 1000px longest side.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-22*

The first is from imgur the second you sent to discord

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

I was able to download 1000x1000 from imgur, but maybe cause it's my gallery...?

you downloadin a smaller version.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-22*

That all that's available on mobile i think

Upside down but I'm super hype about how these "metal" clasps came out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-23*

WOOOOOOOOOOOO

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

Made from fabric and shiny tape <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Sooo close to finishing the jacket hnnnng

Okay I'm done with the jacket! But slight problem

Nah buckles keep moving around, and I don't think I can get the machine to sew around them in place



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

the metal bits on the picture from earlier?
ooo those buckles

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

Yeees

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

can they be hand stitched in place? or if not, perhaps an adhesive that won't stick out?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

Yeah I was leaning towards hand stich but ugghhhhh

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

what are they made of, vinyl?
for all that is good in the world, use a thimble if they're made of vinyl.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

The belts?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

They are pleather material

So ye they tough to.go through

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

oo golly pleather. what machine are you using? :0 mine usually can't do pleather
use a thimble to not kill your fingers if you have one <:rip:369476083248267274>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

OMG YE I NEED A THIMBLE

We got a lil plastic on that barely fits my pinky <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

rest in pieces tom's hand

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

Ehhh I tried hand sewing two fo them and it's super sloppy

I'mma take it out and thing it over I guess

Gonna have to use some sort of adhesive I think

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

are you trying to get the whole belt to stay in place, or just the buckle?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

Just the buckle

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

hmm. then yeah, some adhesive might work, or maybe just 2 small tacks on each side

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

Tacks?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

they're super quick stitches, just one or two tiny stitches to keep it in place. like how suits have the little X's in the back to keep it neat in the store but gets be cut off when you wear it.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-23*

OoO yee

So the corner tacks

Are working

But I kinda wanna die

Should have it done by zenkai with the track I'm going

Probably won't be able to.do the chest wrapping just because I can't figure out for the life of my how that would work

Without drawing it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-24*

Doing some Cosplay Analysis‚Ñ¢ because I'm a workaholic and wanna see what the results of the giveaway tell me

1/91 submissions used a picture of me sans cosplay

2/91 submitted a miraculous ladybug photo

Overwhelmingly, Pyrrha was picked as the fan fav (but that could be because I have more pictures of her)

Assessing now which photos were the most popular...



These are the most submitted photos



And these all got at least 3 submissions

People like when I have pictures alone I guess?

Also <@!351471675843411978> Ryan said he would beast boy if we don't find a suitable green boi

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-24*

picture battle royale
which is the #1? we can determine by taping each picture to a roomba with a knife

katana dude sent me the picture he took im laughin

he was just like "do you guys wanna take pictures with this katana"

**Bill** - *2018-04-24*

Well. Ben took some very good photos. I told you from the start that leaves headshot is amazing.

Makes sense to me solos are popular. More of you in the frame, better detail, they're here for you so they want to see you.

Nobody went past your most recent shoots for each character.

Not exactly but none of those are very old.

*I wonder who likes you out of cosplay hmm hmmu*

I'm okay losing to the leaves portrait because it's really good but I'm breaking my slump by your 4K mark and getting the most liked next time. o7
*Technically I have the most in the top 8 so haha, that's a win*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-24*

I'm doin' it I'm finally gonna do a Hange cosplay
the secondhand site I stalk has a full SnK costume for $29 minus the pants, but for $30 I can get free shipping. They also have a Pan (dragon ball) costume for $1.80 that comes with white/grey pants I miiiight be able to use. but even if I can't heck it's a whole costume for under $2 and getting that will be cheaper than paying for shipping alone.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-24*

**Bill** - *2018-04-24*

The new wig looks the same color as the old one in that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-24*

Hmmm sorta

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-24*

**Bill** - *2018-04-24*

I really could care less.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-25*

i mean they are both mine i made the files for both

erik gave me ideas and feedback

erik and I both like the college font one better i think

<@!184437198865563648>  should i credit you on my cosplay business card? probably right?

**Bill** - *2018-04-25*

What like an actual credit line?

I don't think people do that.

You have to ask someone else.

I'm fine without it, though if my logo manages to not get cropped out of one shot it'd be cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-25*

okey dokey lol the one i used for now doesnt have your logo üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-25*

Ye in the US I‚Äôve never really seen a photog credited. Here sometimes people will do a tiny line at the bottom of the card but the names are really short, like 4 characters at most

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-25*

okey dokey

~~i just never want to leave any one uncredited~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-25*

It's fine. The cards to promote you. üëåüèª

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-25*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-25*

oh wow thank maybe ill consider that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-25*

woah when did the flag thing happen in the rwby chat
was that a thing that just sprung up or has it been in talks for a while
i'm interested but it seems like it happened so fast it already  got calculated and a bunch of people already sent money <:rip:369476083248267274>

**Bill** - *2018-04-25*

I've mentioned it many times.

**Bill** - *2018-04-25*

cause she can get people to pay for her, more like it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-25*

I stand by my opinion that people should be able to donate to their fav cosplayer without judgement

But damn does it fire me up sometimes

**Bill** - *2018-04-25*

Not that she's doing something wrong... I find her pushy though, like a pop up ad or something. That's the part that bugs me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-26*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-26*

TOLDJAA

_are you sure you didn't send this message Tom_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-26*

*IM SURE*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

I should really take advantage of this and cosplay Gwen Stacy



HAL COULD BE SPODERMANS



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-26*

that would work

**Bill** - *2018-04-26*

But would that be cosplay enough for you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

Nah prob not, I'll be spider Gwen :V

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-26*

That would work tho damn

Hal even resembles spoderman enough

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-26*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-26*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-27*

Wait wut

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

üôÑ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

Oh the real deal is I'm the lovable klutz and Hal is the venerated socialite :V

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

üôÑ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-27*

Who posts on social media multiple times per day omg

I have enough cosplay pictures for that but 95% are never gonna see the light of day
Wouldn‚Äôt that annoy people or do people like a lot of posting

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-27*

üò±

Yo so I've decided that con crunching actually sucks butt

And I'd a million times over prefer doing it slowly over a period of time

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

_vaguely recalls someone saying "I'll just always plan my cosplays with enough time before the con"_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-27*

Yeah cept I've been working on it for months already

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-29*

Yea? In a weird way. Everything went as planned today so it was fun, worked on the porch with music so that was good. It's not fun when something breaks or doesn't work the way you thought, then it's stressful

**Bill** - *2018-04-29*

Weird but I get it. As long as you‚Äôre having fun it‚Äôs a good ded.

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*



<@!245270932602486784> you wanted an early one right? These are wigging me out in post, something just doesn't click. Maybe I'm tired but. That ones pretty good.



This is one the ones I've been on about. Am I crazy friends? Is it just meh?

And before you you start, I'm seriously asking Marisa. Saturation and a bigger head is not the problem.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

OwO
i like the lace on the bottom of the skirt
something does seem a little off but I can't place it

if saturation isn't the issue have you tried upping the vibrance <:lenny:395307171539189760>

this is how i post process stuff but i just like colors. might be the background that's off.

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

Could be the white balance....

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

are the backgrounds super busy in all the pictures you're having problems with?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

Yeah I feel like because it's Weiss there's should be more white in everything

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

ye the backgrounds are nice but really busy and doesn't suit weiss much

can i photoshop her head big

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

Do you need permission <:lenny:395307171539189760>

It is an honor

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

Background's are about the same.

There *is* too much color in the stone for Weiss, but not much to be done for that. It's a color issue in my head.

and white purity.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

ooo i wanna try something but i need food
after food i try

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

Just blanket it in white

Up dat exposure

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

i got lazy like .5 seconds into editing it yolo but you can make it look wintery ya



**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

Yes, Desaturating the rock is a thing.

I have 142 images.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

desaturate 142 times üëç

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

cant you like batch desaturate?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

not without desaturating georgia but it only takes a minute to select her and inverse the selection

so it'd only take like maybe 3 hours to desaturate 'em all

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

oh tru

oof

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

I do a radial filter to desaturate around. I don't use photoshop so actual selection isn't a thing.

Nor do I want to do that much editing, remember it's not my thing.

I just want the exposure done nicely.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

MY BOY
he had the switch on his back too



there was also an Asgore but all I have is this creep shot because he was busy moving



Undertale was weirdly super popular this week

Awesome! Did he have the full metaton ex. under it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

is cosplay considered commercial though?

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

It's a glorious grey area.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

yea thats what i thought too

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

People are going to lump it into commerical though, because that's the path of least resistance.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

lame

still a pretty place though

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

You also can't blend in as 'regular people doing regular photos' with cosplay given the outfits tend to stand out.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

ye

oh well

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

Georgia did suggest out of cosplay shooting tho.

(I keep wanting to use ooc but that's out of character)

The reason I wouldn't even try with longwood for cosplay is the 'portfolio photography is not allowed' bit. That's not on most sites. Sounds like they're dicks about photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

what would we even do for that lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

YOU CAN DOES IT

what u gotta do?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

üéµ YOU CAN DO THIS
STAY POSITIVEüéµ

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

good luck have fun.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

Paint and sew the gem for V4 Weiss, repaint weiss' shoes, and remake Pyrrha armor

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

Didn't you repaint the shoes once before Katsu?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

Yeah but remember how I wasn't happy with the color?



I went lighter this time, now I think I'm happy

Also painted the gem yeeeet



**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

yeah, I do. Cool.

Kinda weird how you can keep repainting it and it doesn't like... end up with too much paint or something.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

Only time that's a problem is if you do another coat while it's still wet, or have like 50 coats

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

Okay so the shoes are drying, I'll seal them so the paint stays on with mod podge

The gem is drying, then I'll add the wire for the little pieces and glue that on

The final trial is the Pyrrha armor, and I have enough worbla for ONE shot at this so I'm gonna go slow and steady

Worst case scenario, I'll be a little disappointed that I won't have new armor, but the old ones are still useable with some repairs

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

can't get more?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

For Zenkai? Nope

I order my worbla from Germany lol

So if I can't do new armor for Zenkai it'll be for Anext I guess

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

German worbla.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

Yupppp



Gem is attached yeeeet

Just gotta wire in the dangly-doos later

And now it's back to armor

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

üëå

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

Dangly doos? Lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*



DANGLY DOOS ARE DANGLY DONE

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

Dangly damn.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

I like your stylish shirt under your collar thingy weiss

Canon outfit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

weiss buys hurley

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

oh yeah ofc

ok weiss shoes are sealed

so now i ONLY have armor to tackle

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

now da big boi.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

Ok contact cement isn't working so back to da hot glue

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

for?

foam?

are you coating both parts you want to stick together, waiting for it to dry and then sticking them together?

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*

hmmu. The first time JNPR goes to the weapon forge and Pyrrha be like 'better make sure Nora doesn't kill herself with her power tools' and Nora points out 6 structural flaws in Milo.

that's a headcanon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-05-02*



I feel like Audrey is being influenced from somewhere.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

FIRST NEW SHIN ARMOR HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED MUAHAHAHA



Pros: it's less bulky, the lines are more clean, I reused the knee piece because those were already good

Also, in the back, it's perfectly fitted to my calf on top



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

less bulky and comfy is always good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

So there's a slit on the bottom to get my heel on

Yeeee

So now I gotta make the other new one now and I should be gooood

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

then gotta get that color to match

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

I'd like to redo the thigh armor too but that's for another con

Yeeee I have the spray paint that I used for my other armor already

Also if I don't finish the second piece of armor, I can probably say fuck it, the only place they'll look super different is the back

But that's a worst case scenario

Ok back to armor hell for me

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

*Quietly:* wooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

So my Seven glasses didn't come in in time so I made my own in like 20 mins <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

RIP those sunglasses my mom bought me for my birthday a few years ago

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-02*

its official

ozpin

after nearly 3 years

his cane will be remade

~~it still will be cylindrical cause having a square cane is stupid af~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Looks good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

So for some reason I can't duplicate what I did earlier cause the fit of the leg piece is super wonky for some reason

So I'll have one updated shinguard, one not üòÇ

You can only really tell from the back though, or if you're REALLY looking closely at the two



So once I paint the second one tomorrow I'll be fine

Sucks I couldn't update both but oh well, I don't wanna kill myself trying to do it, and I have a final for tomorrow to finish studying for anyways

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Good plan.

How did triple final day go?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

nah thats next wednesday

tomorrow is an 8 am final so ill drive to school at the crack of dawn lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

I get to sleep in tomorrow, finally.

I'm literally dying at dinner.

Just finish that and it's Zenkai time.

You can technically swing over whenever you want I guess. I'll just be working in my room. And I'll be being pretty lazy about it too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

yeah ill just have to spray the one leg armor and weather it

which will prob take 2 hours max

and ill be home from my final probably by 11

ill see tho

i was gonna throw star on for badge pick up so ill hop in that and we can chill

~~and rewatch star owo~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Whatever works.

I still have to pack. I'll do it tomorrow.

Good thing I organized tomorrow to be running batch jobs.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-03*

I like how some are more faded than others

Is that intentional?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

Sorta kinda

I didn't do it on purpose but I noticed it was happening and didn't wanna fix it lol

Also my mom can't find her mesh bags

You know those bags you get chocolate coins or decorative rocks in?

None of y'all would happen to have one, would you?

My mom doesn't know where hers are

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Nope.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

I might have one? But I won't be able to check till I get home

I know I have some lace ones ü§î

But idk if that would be weird

Makeup came in them!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-03*

Yeah idk,I got one with my headphones but who knows if we still have them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

I think you do, but is smol

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

I'd say cut up a fishnet stocking but... That's no more common a item to find around the house.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

It ok I just took one from a bunch of avocados LOL

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

Nice!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

Now I just gotta finish my make up and I'm outie

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-03*

<@245270932602486784> bae what of my Jaune stuff do you have 
Cause you'll need to bring it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-03*

Hoodie, already packed

That's all

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

I was just thinking leaving earlier might be smart, to avoid traffic.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

For Georgia you mean?

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Ye.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

Oh ok

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

She takes main roads, 80, gsp, etc.

You guys shouldn‚Äôt have trouble.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-03*

Na I thought you were telling us to leave earlier and I was like I literally cannot

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Though unless she already left it‚Äôs a moot point.

**Dave** - *2018-05-03*

Looks like a big accident on rt80 just before rockaway

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Sounds like rush hour traffic on 80 though.

Always a parking lot around rock away, even at 7:30am.

**Dave** - *2018-05-03*

IDK, there was a cop controlling the flow of traffic just before the exit to my house, and Google shows the accident west bound just before rockaway

**Bill** - *2018-05-03*

Oh my.

I assume google will redirect Georgia to 46 if it‚Äôs real bad.

**Dave** - *2018-05-03*

But anyway, be safe on your cosplay adventures my children

Just thinking it could be helpful.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Are y'all doing poppy and Lux cosplay

Is league cosplay happenin

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

It'd be star gaurdian versions

My Friend would be janna

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Fun

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

STAR GUARDIAN YEET

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

*Yeet is not a star guardian skin*

But this definitely helps operation "get Ashley friends" going.

The going part of that title should be said in whatever that league reference tone you do.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Everyone was doing photoshoots, everyone socialized more then ever.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

If we all managed to pulled the costumes together by next, and Ash gets Dan to do star gaurdian jinx
We'd have all 5 Original star gaurdians

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yeeeet

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Okay SO here's the deal

Y'all COULD make it

OR could order it since it's not that expensive compared to the material costs and modify them

That way you'd have time for Yona too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Doing 2 cosplays in a month IS possible but you'll die

I don't recommend it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

2 cosplay in a month ez pz

do it

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Hush! Not all of us have made a deal with the devil for insane cosplay making speeds

But IF you do order it, you'll have to do it soon so they have time to make it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

yona is simple unless u doin princess yona or you do the collar like it is in the manga with all the fancy extra gold trim. the underdress makes nice pajamas

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

My humble suggestions, I will slip out now nuoom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

cant beilive toms making me be a green haired girl and its not even waifu CC

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

i made 2 costumes in a week for katsu last year but i can't remember what they were. holo was one. what was the second.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Ik what kinda trash am i

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

the kind that gets recycled for lots of money

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

I can probably make both, yona is basically Jedi robes and lux is a sailor moon outfit

I already have a pattern for the pink part on luxs thing

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

ooo sailor outfits are easy too
girl u got dis u can do it in a day

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

I'm not saying y'all can't, I'm just saying you may not.wanna die <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Technically it's down to the floor because she smol

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Ezreal is the only dude?

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Star Guardian or Regular?

WOW IM GONNA BE SUCH A CUTE GIRL

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

"I was one of his groomsman you know."
"Who, the tall blonde?"
"No, the one with the hammer and ears."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Hell yea!

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

The question none of you are asking though.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

üò±

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

IF IT EXISTS IT CAN BE SHIPPED

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Poppy and Garen is a ship!

CUZ GAREN IS POOPIES SENPAI

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Crack or not, I'm just feeding you two to your SOs.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

;0

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Whaaaaaaat?

Ohhhh NVM read that wrong

Lux ezreal is pretty popular

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

yeah it is

not as popular as Ezreal taric but its up there

https://static.lolwallpapers.net/2016/04/5704c534e1952.jpg

For Example, they acknowledged it in this skin splash art, ezreal is in the foreground

and tristana is taking the picture (but the phone screen shows the old splash art)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Caitlyn ezreal is also a thing

Also Zoe hard core crushes on him

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

caitlyn Vi is def bigger
also Vi Jinx

and Jinx and caitlyn

the triforce

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Ye 
They both have bigger ships, but the ship be there

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-08*

~~and yoosung in the eye~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

I need to get my measurements. Tom Jess, you wanna like... do a thing and also help me do that thing?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

Measure you?

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

aye.

I ordered de angel beats uniform, but uh. Asian sizing. That didn't work out.

So I need to custom order it asapu.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-08*

Yee we just did that ourselves for the costumes

I hope I didn't order too smol

Women's sizing doesn't always translate to men's good

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

I could be awkward and go into like, JCPennys to get a suit guy to do it but...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

I could probably do it

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

I mean, if you two are busy it's okay too.

Could just meet at the mall tomorrow or wednesday night, have dinner and do that where ever.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

you could just come over lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

truuuuue

I should go to the mall Wednesday though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

damn cosplay will have you buying all sorts of weird shit

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

whatchu buyin

i'm trying to think of the weirdest stuff i've bought. nothing too drastic comes to mind. a hula hoop to make a ballgown out of.

goat nose

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

i bought a binder, i bought a cheap one but it was super tiny so last night i ordered a good one
last night i ordered stuff for saeran/unknown and i looked at the cart like "well that looks kinky"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

awww oh no üò≠ 
U DOIN UNKNOWN!! YES!
we gotta do a ray/unknown shoot someday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

YEA actually toms doing it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

WOO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

mean ill prob wear it eventually

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

you be seven
the trifecta will be complete

as soon as i get back to a sewing machine, ray's pink/purple suit is the first thing i'mma make

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

i traded him one LOL cosplay for one MM cosplay <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

and then raphtalia

cosplay as currency. the new capitalism

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

this is what marriage is really about

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

I have bought an unhealthy about of plastic pellets from amazon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

i used to use clay but i didn't like it, either too heavy or too light. now i make accessories out of plastic coated in paper mache

only if they're colored. if they're white i don't use paper mache but if I paint them it makes any imperfections like 500x more noticable so on goes the paper mache and then sanded down

raven's belt was made out of pringles lids

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

like you melt and mold it?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

thats so cool!

yea no not the pringle lids

i was thinking of making ravens belt out of shower curtain grommets

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

for christmas a few years ago I asked for a heat gun just so I could melt them more precisely <:lenny:395307171539189760>
ooo that's interesting! gold grommets with stuff in the middle? owo

OH one time I bought uhhhh. what're they called. like, stuff you put on the edge of flooring when it transitions into another type of flooring. i made it into a sword.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

ye!

oh the metal edging thing?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

ye that stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

nice

creative

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

i stole it from a tip i read on the internet. like how bra inserts can be used for muscles üí™

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

when i made my hammer my dad walked me through home depot like "let me show all these house building supplies you could use for stuff someday"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

yes home depot is a gold mine for cosplay

i always have a can of foam insulation, that dangerous pink stuff in attics

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

the spray kind isnt dangerous though right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

idk. maybe? i assume everything will kill me because my work space is like 2 square feet of room in the bathroom

i use the bathtub for everything, except fabric. i use the couch for that because no table <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

i think my dad told me spray insulation is safe

oh no! D:

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

i n h a l e the s p r a y

wait no that's illegaL NO DON'T LISTEN TO THAT

NEVERMIND

***DO NOT INHALE***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

our entire house looks like a cosplay wasteland right now

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

as it should

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

theres like 18 shades of hair in the bathroom,  hammer scrapes on the porch, my seven stuff is just scattered all over the kitchen table. the actual cosplay room is a disaster area

and i haven't even unpacked RIP

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

YEAH!!! my sink here has a bunch of blonde, brown, red, and purple bunches of hair sitting on the edge of it. i should sweep that up. *but what if i need it*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

magnhilds just chillin in my back seat and im waiting for a coworker to be like "wtf is that thing in your car?"

but half my coworkers have seen RWBY so maybe they'd think is coo?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

what is magnhild made of?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

pine, poster tubes, and eva foam

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

oki cool cool. my crescent rose scythe melted after one otakon because it's thermoplastics and I had loaded it into the car saturday night, sunday was so hot that when we left around 4pm it was a bit misshapen. that miiight have a small effect on the eva foam? but not as severely

watch out in heat

but also otakon was like literally 100 degrees

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

oh yea thats a good idea, ill take it out when i get home

when i come back from lunch ill park in the shade

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

good idea

protec at all cost

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

yea that would suck id be so sad

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

i wonder if i could use the backyard at home to do cosplay stuff. maybe only spray painting. it's like a sandlot and i don't want the sand getting onto fabric. hmm.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

come to our house <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

oh nothing in particular right now

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

90% of my answers will probably be "uhhhHh you just. do... this."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

totally understandable

but yea we have like lots of floor space, at least 3 tables 4 if you count the coffee table, the backyard

the garage, if its raining and you need to spray paint

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

i would show up to be able to cut on a flat surface <:lenny:395307171539189760>
our house is around 500 square feet over 3 floors, but the 3rd floor is basically uninhabitable half of the year because there's no air circulation or air conditioning up there. it literally sucks the breath out of you when you go up the stairs and you sweat just standing still even in march.
first floor has a lot of sewing machines. so many sewing machines. literally the entire back wall is sewing machines. you need a sewing machine? we have sewing machines. plus half the first floor is the kitchen. second floor is shelves of clothes ~~and anime oops~~

i set up a great workshop on the third flood and then summer hit <:rip:369476083248267274> so it became more storage instead. lots of fabric. so much fabric.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

when you come back, we do workshop day <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-09*

üò¨

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*



*that's not the reaction I expected for greek architecture out of you*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-09*

i dont have any friends that go there tho :c

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

If it was a public campus I'd say fuck it and go, but it's a private, roman catholic college.

I tried googling if they had an anime club we could hit up, but no dice.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-09*

My mom went there

Lots of SISTERS go there

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

~~Nun cosplayers~~

I pass it's train station in the mornings.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-09*

Tom's mom went there

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

I've had it on my list of things to check out for awhile, but seems like a hassle.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-09*

FUCK THAT AMPHITHEATER IS NIC

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

I mean, it's alright looking. Needs more stone work.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-09*

Eh amphitheaters are supposed to be simple

*Greek amphitheaters

And more natural

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-09*

It's a religious school as far as I know

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

It's a very religious school afaik.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-09*

Good 
Cause I was about to say I don't actually like the stage part lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

I think that's part of it though? Like, even the satellite image shows it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-09*

That's mildly frustrating

Imho at least

Amphitheaters are the beacon of minimalist set and stage design

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

There's a Amphitheater in central park, dedicated to shakesphere. By his rustic looking lodge house (Renora set).

But it's locked up outside of events cause it's a legit place.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-09*

Lol RIP back under 400 cuz people didn't get titties today üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

I'll say the same thing I tell Georgia, just meaningless people on the internet.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-09*

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-10*

What do y'all use to change your eyebrow.colors?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

i think colored eyeliner? at least thats what georgia was using for pyrrha the otehr day

i have some nyx brand but they dont work?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-10*

ya colored eyeliner, or here they sell eyebrow pencils in a bunch of different colors. ben nye would also work but it's expensive, that's what people use for full-body paint.
you gotta color your eyebrows flesh-colored first and then paint over it. lipstick also works. i've used acrylic paints but not recommended .

if it's a super light color (like white or blue), glue your eyebrows down first then bury them under a ton of skin-colored makeup

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

i should look at my colored eyeliners when i get home

knew i should had the hair stylist bleach my brows

i had this blue eyeliner that was the shit, but it was super old so i had to throw it out

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

http://www.thefivewitswigs.com/shop/wigs/magical-girl-pink-heartbreak/

JACKPOT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-11*

noice

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-11*

Some of the clips fell off cuz they were glued on so I gotta reglue them but that's fine

Overall I'm pretty happy with it

Was hard to get the whole thing in the shot unfortunately

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-11*

TOM IS A PRETTY POPPY WOOOO

next stop: eyeliner

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-11*

Yeeeeee

Shave foundation eyeliner and eyebrows

Is prob what I'm gonna do

Oo and hammer

Woops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

Sweg

**Bill** - *2018-05-11*

Don't forget to shave dem legs.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-11*

nah dont really need to

poppy wears pants

i might trim tho cuz its uncomfortable

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Time to see which of my contacts are still good oh boy

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Uh ohhhh

So despite how woohoo I was about this whole cross playing thing I still feel a bit odd. Which is wierd cuz I didn't before but I do now. Hmmm.. I do really like the costume, and I'm definitely still going to wear it but for some reason I'm uncomfortable at this very moment. I'm sure it'll passüòï

Not sure why tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Work it girl
U got this

If you feel uncomfortable shaving your legs and there‚Äôs part of your leg that shows in the costume you can try opaque tights

S‚Äôall about that contour <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Nahh not that

And legs are covered cuz poppy wears pants

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

You'll have Dave and Joe with you too.

That'll help.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Lmao idk if Joe's doing it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Biru crossplay when

Not to mention your wife who supports you.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Never.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Like I think I'll look good

But ... Not myself?

It's odd

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

It's about your comfort, not the look.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

It's really hard to describe

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

You can be ugly as fuck but if you feel hot that's perfect.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Like I am comfortable too

It's just.. aghh it's so hard to explain

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Mm...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Fight your turmoil. Punch it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

LIKE I COULD BE SUCH A BAMF WASTELAND RAIDER

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Nice humanstuck karkat cosplay

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Marisa you've ruined my life

Well also that got me thinking



FEEEEELS???????

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Rest in pieces
Omg you could make a cape out of sheer fabric and stick dust/rock particles on it to make it look like you‚Äôre crumbling apart

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

AGHHHH

THEY MAKE ME UNCOMFORTABLE

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

NOW YOU KNOW HOW YOUR TOE SOCKS MAKE ME FEEL

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

NO THATS DIFFERENT

YOU DINT WEAR TOE SOCKS ON YOUR EYES

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

... yes this is true

I have this really goth loli looking wig too



It started out as testing contacts and quickly became wig testing

oh man I looked in the mirror yeah that's spoopy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Nice Aradia cosplay

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

MARISA YOURE RUINING MY LIFE the wig was actually from a disciple cosplay hue

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Shoutout to the Disciple

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Those are amazing

I wants. Curse Stoopid astigmatism eyes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah looking through them is like there's a light fog over everything too

It's spook

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Lol I'd be so blind

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

I like the eyes with the Pyrrha wig

I've been batting around alternative Pyrrha ideas

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Yea that's sweet

Dead pyrrha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeee

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

You could paint little burnt patches of skin

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Like everyone at RTX is doing something cool Saturday so I feel like I wanna be regular pyrrha most of Saturday and somehow level it up Saturday afternoon

I.E. a Volume 4-6 would-have-been Pyrrha or a dead Pyrrha or a Grimm Pyrrha

Something that's like Pyrrha, but a little MORE

Also preferably comfier than armored Pyrrha

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Pyrrha *on ice*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

_yeah_

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Oh, I can hit up the fanart folder for alternate Pyrrha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

DO IT

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Later.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

What about like a queen design

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Queen?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Also. When you were saying wasteland raider I was thinking ghoul

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh no not a spoopy ghoul those are super creepy

I just mean like a bandit

Ye

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Like a fancy velvet dress with lots of gold embellishments

Ooo bandit Pyrrha

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

When I get home I'll ping you whatever could work.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Meido Pyrrha chan

MAGICAL GIRL

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Idk the wow factor of the contacts is really gettin me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

MARISA NO

I would need like... a plush skin suit

In Texas heat

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Plz don't kill Georgia

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Pyrrha fursuit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

We don't want her to be actual dead pyrrha

Lmao furries at rtx

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Dead furries lmao

I could maybe switch my Weiss wig if I wanted white hair for dead Pyrrha hm

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Then people would call you Weiss.

Let's be real.

Save Grimm Pyrrha for like, Katsu. Cause you gotta have fur linings to it to be all beowulf like.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Not with Pyrrhas makeup and outfit, it‚Äôd be dead Pyrrha rip

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Oh, maiden!Pyrrha.

An outfit based on the idea she has the powers.

Work in a call back to Amber's outfit.

Or Purrha because that typo is hilarious.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Áå´ËÄ≥„É¢„Éº„Éâ„Åß„Åô

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

üò±

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Ok but thoughts???



I'm leaning towards one way but idk what to think for sure yet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Space pyrrha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh PERF astronaut Pyrrha you right

I think the red hair is more strikingly Pyrrha but the white hair is also A Look‚Ñ¢

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Suppose it works.

Yeah, the crown really helps to identify Pyrrha.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

ANGEL PYRRHA

Wings! White outfit!

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Basically Greek mercy but Pyrrha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

I'm thinking more "spirit" than angel but Ye that's an idea too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

god tier pyrrha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Mmmm I'm leaning more towards white hair now it's more striking in a way

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Jedi ghost Pyrrha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*



üé∂Comparison square üé∂

The white is like more foreign in a way

Like the red is like aw that's our Pyrrha

But the white is like oh god Pyrrha what happen

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

British Pyrrha.

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

I don't get shock factor from it yet. Potentials there though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Are you feelin it now mr krabs

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

üò±

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeahhhh

I wanna use a lot of tulle and make a big flowy Greek-inspired dress



Like this

But 10 pounds more of tulle

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

And scorch marks <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Is that girl 10 o.O

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Shhh that‚Äôs Georgia

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*



Now I just look like a cool oracle person

~~in a NASA shirt~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Tell me da future

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

*does the little psychic motion* tom... will... make you breakfast tomorrow!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

That's true! He allready said he would üòÅ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

‚ú® futuuure ‚ú®

Now I feel like I'm back to square 1 with alternate Pyrrha ideas

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

I like the spirit idea!

Maybe body paint too?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah but then I'd have to be ghost Pyrrha all day as opposed to half day

I was hoping for something relatively shocking but easy enough to do while changing in a bathroom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh yea ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Alternate dance outfits, if you guys want to mix it up next year's Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

I wanted to make her actual dress originally but meh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

UGH why did Pyrrha have to die now I don't have any other outfits for her to make

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Yeahh... It unfortunate

Not her death,just that she has no more outfits

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

^^^^

My follower engagement has been weirdly up lately

A couple people messaged me about my con plans and if I'd open a PO box anytime soon

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Wow georgia nice sollux cosplay up there
You‚Äôve reached true fame when people ask for a PO box woah

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Holy fuck Erik's eyebrows.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Tim? Why are you in this street photography video from London?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

lmao

OOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooooooOOOOO

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

god *damnit* I need a grey card.

Auto white balance has been fucking with my head recently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

A grey card?

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

it's a card that's exactly the right color to set the white balance against.

You meter it in the light you're shooting in, and then set the camera to use that setting.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Ooooo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

If I'm opening a PO box should I make an Amazon wishlist? It feels kinda weird to do so ü§î

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah you should

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

What do I even like hmmm

~~can't put all you guys on my amazon wishlist :V~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Cosplay items (worbla for example) 
Space stuff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Worbla isn't on Amazon

SPACE IS THO

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

That's so weird.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*





HMMMMMM I appreciate these comments but I also think H O W

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Maybe they just saying it cause you like Pyrrha?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Like I get what they're saying

Or trying to say

I just think it's funny cause Pyrrha has a pretty general face

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

The old models were not exactly detailed no.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Those butts didn't send me my thigh highs either !!!

Grrrr

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

A bolt is a big wrap of fabric

It big

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Is it all the same fabric

Are they full bolts or like skimpy half bolts <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Full bolts gosh dang

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

A madman

Yo I'm letting diamond city radio play in the background as I wrap Poppy's handle

It's so lit

**Bill** - *2018-05-13*

Fallout 3 had better radio.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-13*

~~they reused some of the tracks from 3 in 4 though~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-13*

Tru

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-13*

Girl do you have a grommet hole puncher. Makes life so much easier.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-13*



WHEW

Wow it's dark in here

Blurry as shit

Wish I had banana for scale

But it's a bit smaller than Manghild

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-13*

Ooooo
I thought it was chopstick sized
That scale changes things

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-13*

It was a 4 ft rod and I cut 18 cm off

I'm not doing that math xD

Over a meter

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-13*

Oh yea I got the grommet puncher.

It was suppa easy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-13*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-13*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-13*

So cryptic

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-13*

It's Marisa's handwriting

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-13*

OHH!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-13*

OwO

[mails out letters that just say OwO but they‚Äôre written in blood]

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-13*

ACCEPTABLE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-13*

Who's blood is it üò±

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-13*

So I just realized something

For all his complaints about how labinnak barely does anything and steals jakescribbles credit on the cosplay work

Because she only like paints it a lot of times

Ethan basically did the same thing 
For his entire business

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*



AAAAANY guess what the comment issssss?



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-14*

Yeeeeet

The costume company contacted me back and are sending replacements, though they said it could take a month

No clue if they'll.make a next, I'll have to make due

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

The thigh highs you can get yourself right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

What was wrong with the costume?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-14*

The left glove pinky was sewn in half, a bunch of fabric bunched up inside, and they didn't send the gold  over the  knee socks things with gold diamond plate things on the knees

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

atrocious

I really wanna cosplay Jaehee this weekend but it's probably not a good idea as literally no one will know who she is and I'll be wearing my work clothes. what if someone recognizes me. oops.

proper jaehee with the lanyard and a cat and stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

~~come coaplay with me and tom instead~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

yes pls
acosta tickets are on sale until wednesday come come <:lenny:395307171539189760>

I might do attack on titan instead if I can find a cheap wig.
would white leggings work instead of white pants.
what if I just put a pair of white leggings over black skinny jeans. bam. white jeans.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

i think white leggings would work

ooo if you do jaehee you have an excuse to drink coffee all day

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

I don't drink coffee some people consider it a drug <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

hot chocolate! in a coffee cup

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

*genius*

they have this stuff here called iced cocoa and I assumed it would be the grossest thing ever but it was the only thing on the karaoke menu that seemed palatable to me ~~no hot cocoa omg~~ so I ordered it and it was actually really good

karaoke places are super cheap but you have to buy a drink for like $5

I might stop by akihabara tomorrow and see if there's any good secondhand cosplay for sale but if not I'll attack the titans

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

My theory that friend group has shipping calls to me.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

What ya mean

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

That feels shippy. My ship senses are tingling.

And I've speculated before that between Danielle (I believe that was her real name), Brandon, Meg, Tyler, originally Lissy but less so now there's got to be some feels going around.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

Well she literally just broke up with her boyfriend like a week or so ago

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

opps

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

*i sense it*

Though, I barely know them so I ain't going to actively try and ship.

Delaware squad is for watching, BNE is for shipping.

so... anyone got a clue what's going on with Jaime?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Why she's in Ohio?

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

at an amusement park, with one guy judging by the tags on the pictures she posted?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

yea im pretty sure they are dating?

like i dont think they announced it yet but unless he's family

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Ye, that's the feeling I get. It is a new relationship right, I feel like I wouldn't have heard about it before now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

yea its new

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Spring has sprung, I can sense all dis romance going around.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

YEAH HAL AND I JUST TALKED ABOUT THAT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

Wut?

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Dunno. But Jake was clearly pissed.

I have so many headcanons for this guy man.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

Rightly so I bet 
For somebody to be "abusing" the server, they'd have to actually be one of the Mods or Admins

And all the Mod/Admins are like 
Jake and Casey's friends they know

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Where do you see abusing?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

I don't see the term abusing, but it's what the message is saying
But it's like 
If somebody messaged Bill 
And was like yeah that Tom guy is using Whoozica and Aurii to get money for Cons

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

Lol lmao

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

I use abuse in terms of not like harm 
 But taking somebody's trust and using it to manipulate them for their own benefit via lies etc

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

The reason I say the term specifically is because manipulation fits with a serious concern for someone with as much exposure as Casey. The story goes Casey is actually a quiet person and "OMGIMRUBY" is her stage persona. If that's the case, her being used by people is probably a big concern of hers and her friends, especially one as close as Jake. So it may hit very close to home for an actual concern. 

Of course, that's a good thing for *this* guy (cause tripping a fear of theirs is a good way to manipulate them into believing him), but Jake didn't take the bait and stood up for the other guy. Who knows whose right.

But, Jake stayed about gossipmongering and drama which is an excellent move.

Anyone could be *manipulating* though, mod abuse is much more limited. Hence why I wanted to be sure of the term.



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah 
I say mod abuse because for it to be somebody who is manipulating the chat and Casey 
It would have to be one of the mods-admins on the server 
They are super concerned about people using Casey
Like its tough to meet her outside events, even through her friends because they don't want to let people they're unsure about getting to her

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

*is it weird I'm not sure if the first parents are Georgia and Hal or his birth parents*

You can manipulate people without mod powers. Social engineering.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

no I know, the key term is using casey

even in her server, she doesn't pop up except for voice parties or streaming

and puts on her rwby persona

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Mhmm.

Supports the *instafame is not her personality* theory.

I meant to use quotes not italics.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Whoops.

Which I'm neutral on. Casey is Casey, whatever. The only interest I have in her is if she and Jake and are actually a thing cause I ship it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

#priorities

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I barely ship RWBY stuff, yet I ship irl people like it's going out of style.

What a weirdo.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

_you step away from my son_

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

<@!288513265661902858> Was there anything in your theatre training that was for helping people give directions reversed? IE stage right/stage left being different depending on how you look at it?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

Stage right stage left is based on if your on stage facing the audience

House right house left is for if your looking towards the stage

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

hmm. Nothing for getting in the habit, but the distinction before it is a good idea.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeahhh 
They are constants though, stage  right is always the same, it doesn't matter which way your looking
 so that's helpful

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

"Congrats"
"Congrats"
"Congrats"
"Congrats"
"You look like Shit"

*That's it; that's the ship!"*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

Bro calm down üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

I mean, it's just hilarious on it's own.

So you get any followers today Jess?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

2 I think?

One was some kid from your grade I haven't seen since HS

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-16*

So hang on one moment though, why is there so much drama in the cosplay community nowadays. Like damnnnn

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

Eh, it's not actually that bad. My circle stays drama free for the most part, and we've pulled Georgia and Hal into that. Our RWBY group Beacon Northeast is pretty much drama free. We just know where to look for drama.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-16*

place your bets now: will the dollar (100 yen) store have glue guns?

I bought a wig yesterday that I need for Sunday, but ponytail attachments were more expensive and they didn't have the exact color as the base wig. so I bought a super long wig and put it in a ponytail but it's really not the same. so tomorrow i'm gonna go buy brown felt, a hair clip, and some glue and make the ponytail attachment myself.
where would I even buy a glue gun if the dollar store doesn't have it hnng

*another dollar store*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

üò±

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-16*

they sell literally everything else so i'd hope so. you can buy enamel and resin there for accessories too.

GOOGLE SAYS THEY HAVE GLUE GUN GLUE IN RAINBOW COLORS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*



That's better!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

CUUUTE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

I'm trying to figure out how it stayed styled in the mail

Also best boi 9s came in

Now I'm conflicted for CPAC üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Nicu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

You might wanna be 2bee and 9ass?

**Dave** - *2018-05-17*

My cosplay doesn't fit me :(

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

_pics_

**Dave** - *2018-05-17*

Changed back, too late, only tom ~~and jess~~ got to see me

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

I came home to a strange car in front of my house and a man in a skirt in my house

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Going to be a short day for nier. Might be worth saving for a full con.

Party at the Garrity's eh. I see.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

~~lol short days are good for nier dem shoes are killer~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Won't have anywhere to sit as CPAC tho. Possibly. The venue is brand new, who knows what'll well be seeing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

I mean I always bring back up shoes for 2b

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

~~I wanna do a chill day for photos so don't do the one I'm going to take a hella lotta photos for~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

^^^^

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

Best boiiiii



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

Yeah that's why I'm gonna be comfy, to check out the new venue more so than cosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

~~ok but like I want photos for both~~ üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

Ooooh snazzy

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

So do the easier one now like planned, and at Next we can bang out edgy robots.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

He comes with a little baggg

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

~~or the edgy robots can bang, idk~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

Con bag!

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

~~and thus, Tomothy became the pack mule~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

<:lenny:395307171539189760> üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

I have references images for 707/unknown though

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

Forreal this cosplay is really nice

So dang cute

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

The stitching looks real clean

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

And we'll match so fucking good cuz it's the same material üôå

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

The Poppy in Tom want to bang the 9s in Tom.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

üòÆ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

Yea probably

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

The material is so stretchy it's so niceee

But still thick

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

But does it also come with a new found love of showing your butt?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

New?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

Ha!

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Pfft.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

And 9s doesn't show his butttt

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

Priorities: knowing how the booty looks in a cosplay

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

Ofccc

I choose to wear tight pants for a reason <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

The other half of JNPR got bumped Friday of next... you could swap in sad robots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

I don't think we're doing rwby at next

Sept pj/formal

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

That's what I was suggesting, one way or the other.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

YEEt

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

I mean, bleeeeeh, but it's gotta be more fun as a squad.

So I'm planning edgy teen robots for Next. Good deal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

Oh JNPR? Yea it's fun as a team it's also fun as renora though

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

~~but then photoshop Tom as Adam in to be all "I want 9s too bitch"~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

Yessss

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

All of Tom's cosplays want to bone all of his other cosplays.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

I could do 9s also and Tom can do Adam (not for next just in general)

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

~~Never before has a couple being the same build been so perfect~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

Hell yea it's awesome

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

_> Jess: Dominate me. 
> Tom: üëåüèª
> Jess, holding Adam Cosplay: Not like that, wearing this...
> Tom: brb.jpg
> Tom comes back, jess is in 9s
> Jess: choke me as a robot boy! 
> Tom: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è_

This is why I don't nap, I'm weird half asleep.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-17*

~~Tom can do Adam and Jess could do 9s and then Adam could do 9s!~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

~~still less weird then another cosplay pair we could do~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Which...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

Saeren and Seven lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

~~twin brothers~~

Ye

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Aaaaaaaah.

I'm going to need a squirt gun to hit y'all with when you get kiss in your token incest cosplays.

The fucks with that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

MUAHAH ITS NOT ME THIS TIME

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

*This time*

I'm judging you for *ever doing it*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-17*

üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

~~you know how many fangirls I could get with that~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

Rake em in girl.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

~~subscribe to my patereon for Choicest kissing~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-17*

... that's not even a joke, you guys could make dough of a patreon set for MM.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-17*

üòÇ

<@!245270932602486784>  who are you cosplaying to CPAC?

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Star I believe.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

yeeeeee comfies all around

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Exactly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

Whooo!

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Hey, maybe I'll bring the smaller old camera.

Cause light.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

Yea!

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Then again my definition of light is different than everyone else. üòè

See: Georgia "really heavy" suitcase.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

i mean i dont travel light to the hotel. i.e. me cross bodying 3 or more bags at katsu

in cosplay <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

abandon use of suitcases
use storage totes instead

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

i use like duffle bag things

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

i've used a couple of these a few times



**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

My duffel is baller, minus the fact my laptop only fits in the top pouch.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

youre such a pro cosplayer marisa

I use the floral duffle bag thingies

that was most of out katsu packing  4 "suitcases" plus i have a side bag thingy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

such tiny suitcases. you should bring more <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

I only use the storage bins for tricky costumes, like one skirt I had that couldn't bend so I had to pack it like a cone standing up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

üòÆ

all my cosplays are foldable so far  thank god

i ussually pack all my cosplays in one bag, and my toiletries and regular cloths in the other

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

why u bringing regular clothes to a con

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

good question

well Georgia had to borrow some at zenkai for the rave

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

~~so you don't end up like Georgia~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

and i dont sleep in cosplay ~~unless its PJ JNPR~~

i brought like 3 regular outfits to zenkai but all i used was my PJ pants and my mystic mess tshirt

OH no i used shorts too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

i'll bring regular clothes if I wear a cosplay on the drive down thursday, but if not my thursday clothes are my regular clothes <:lenny:395307171539189760>
that's a little gross but I've never needed to re-wear them. at zenkai we have staff polos too so there's that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

yea no that makes sense

im just an overpacker XD

but it comes in handy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

during the katsucon fire alarm I'm so hashtag blessed I was in the warmest cosplay I had. it was still freezing but at least I was fully covered, I felt so bad for girls in bikinis and stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

üò±

yea that sounds terrible. it was prob like 40 at katsu and me and tom went out to the pier to take pics and i was so cold

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

aaaaaaa it was below freezing
also some procession just went by my apartment. traditional flute-y sounds what is going on

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

üòÆ

guys which cosplay of toms should i put on mine and toms double business card?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Should be doing Leo pretty soon so...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

üëå Toms Leo is lit AF

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

i thought tom was virgo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

lmao

not that kinda leo

i wanna make us a card for CPAC ~~so we can reep the fangirl rewards together~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

reminds me of con bingo cards
one of my friends got bingo with "visibly uncomfortable celebrity"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

con bingo cards? üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Use that picture of Yoosung and Seven.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

LMAO NO

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

I mean, you want MM fangirls, that'll do it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

[slides card to the voice actors of 707 and yoosung while whispering "bingo"]

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

It's a good enough shot.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*



**Bill** - *2018-05-18*



Oh woops thats the one where you got all predator.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

THERE WAS A JESUS AT ZENKAI

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

There was a jesus at our high school too.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

ye he goes every year!! what a savior

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

i was seven so i was i was like "DAB FOR JESUS!" and he was like "thank you:"

cosplaying seven is addicting tbh

tom: "i dont even know if ill cosplay sunday of animenext"
me: "the return of budget yoosung?!"

OH WAIT <@!184437198865563648>  whos was the jesus at our school? ~~cuz it may have been my ex~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

wow i can't believe jesus is your ex

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

~~i cant believe jesus broke up with me~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

I have no idea what his name was, but he had Jesus hair.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

our grade?

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

~~So, yeah, I guess you were probably attracted to him~~

no idea.

I just saw him in the lunch room sometimes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

he was jesus to a school Halloween dance and they kicked him out

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

no one is free from sin

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

yea that was most likely my ex opps

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*



*can you not*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-18*

Hahaha temple plzzzz

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

Ahhh someone said my Pyrrha was sexy and beautiful

Sexy is such a weird compliment

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

Was it a guy or a girl
Little less creepy from a girl but still weird

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

A guy üò¶

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

To the list...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

Oh ho ho Ben messaged ME first this time asking if I wanted to shoot

Now I must be cool

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Didn‚Äôt he message you first before anyway?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

Uhmmmmm I feel like I planted the idea and then he messaged me

But he did ALL the effort this time

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Even for the hillsbourgh shoot?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

I mean I was like Pyrrha would be cool to shoot and he was like Ye and then later he hit me up to go to hills borough

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Aaaah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

I feel like every woman should have a pair of black biking shorts

Like the kind I have on Pyrrha

They were like 8 dollars but now I throw them on under my dresses and just to sleep in and they're so versatile

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

that's a unique though on a friday afternoon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

Oh I'm wearing them now under my dress for the wedding lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

i have 2 of those! they're great

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

~~they make the booty look good too~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

YEA

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

THEYRE SO VERSATILE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

i have a white pair and a black pair

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

I got mine for Pyrrha and I just adapted them to like everything else I wear

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

There's a character in ToAru who has shorts under her skirt as one of her things.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-18*

Like they hold up well too and I've definitely gotten my money's worth

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

>.>

Odds of Georgia doing a MC formal cosplay to join him. Very likely.

**Dave** - *2018-05-18*

Is that the same person that said your cosplay was sexy?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

na

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Do we know though?

I assume Dave was talking about the insta screencap.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*



**Dave** - *2018-05-18*

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

*am I about to be assaulted*

Also that gun seems to lack an orange tip and looks realistic, that's a no go unless you wanna get shot by the real police.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-19*

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-19*

It's a BB gun

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-19*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-19*



Anybody with that much alcohol:

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

Still.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-19*

What about $150 in fabric 
You could make a toga and that‚Äôs about all $150 will get you in fabric <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

I don‚Äôt need fabric, I don‚Äôt cosplay.

This guy wanted a kabedon because Hanji was his ex wife‚Äôs favorite character and he wanted to make her jealous or something

pros of japanese cosplay events: there are like 5 recurring foreign cosplayers tops, including me, and I'm the only one with glasses so people I've met can recognize me super easily even if I have no idea who they are <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-05-20*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

<@!301927856240459777> con story for you

so i showed up as MC today to surprise tom and jess as saeren and 707

and it got really warm later in the day so i was like ahhhhh and changed into star

BUT i was walking towards the door with them, and someone asks if they can get a picture of "you all" and gesture to me and tom and jess

and i was like "uhhh us three?" and she was like "yeah! youre rika right??"

_when i was in fact cosplaying star butterfly_

but i just went "i CAN be!" and hopped in the photo

it was hilarious

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

It was def the devil horns

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

but _the hearts on my face_?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

Well I think she saw you from behind at first

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

yeah but then i turned around and she still thought i was rika lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Ever have one of those indecisive moments where you're not sure whether to do another new cosplay, or just go with one you already have. That's me rn lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

thats me ALWAYS

i feel that

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

It's so bad lmao

Glad someone feels me tho üòÇ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

<@!245270932602486784>  do you have white boots that would go up to about the knees? i just realized lulu has boots not flats and i figured id check with you cuz we same size <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

I have some knee high black boots from when I wanted to cosplay black rock shooter forever ago LMAO if you can find out what type of paint to paint over vinyl to make them white, you can have them

Otherwise I just have my Weiss boots which are a blue to white gradient üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

üòÆ that could work! ill try to look up what i could paint with them, that would be really great, are you sure you dont want them?

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Black Rock Shooter eh.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeee I made the cannon and everything, and it was pretty sweet

I was like 15

I was too self conscious to unzip the cool jacket though LOL

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

AWWW üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

And yeah I don't want them, they're very cartoony looking in that they're perfect for a magical girl or Anime cosplay

But like..... I don't do those often

And when I do it's Yona with flats or regular school girl shoes lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

ok, if you need gold flats i got you, cuz thats what i bought for lulu before i realised XD

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

I can imagine BRS's outfit being an issue for you, yes.

*but dat cannon*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

did you actually make the whole outfit and everything? D:

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah! But then the kid I was friends with was storing it at his house. And we stopped talking so he destroyed it üòÖ

And I used the wig for something else and idk what eventually happened to it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

WHAT EVEN omg

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

And then someone bought the jacket off me??

So I just have the bikini top and the shoes left

And I lost the bikini top

And now I have just the shoes

The sole survivor of my once black rock shooter cosplay lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

<:rip:369476083248267274>

that cray

spray paint for plastic should work

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

OH WAIT JESS ALSO I know nothing about wood so maybe you could use your ‚ú®hammer expertise‚ú® and help me out in figuring out what wood I could use for Lux's staff?? I think if want it to be pretty durable so I'd like to use wood over worbla for the big parts

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

magnhild's handle is made from pine, its super light weight and p.durable, also cheap, although since luxes staff is round youd pro wanna start with a wooden dowel? <@!351785752197201920>  got one for poppy's hammer that was about 4ft, not sure what type of wood but its also pretty light. they have all differnt thicknesses in the wood asile at the home dept, and lowes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Okie so pine or whatever tom got, in a wooden dowel form, yeet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

yeet!

imma make lulus want from an old curtain rod XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

So do you have power tools to cut the wood? I know my dad has a thing to saw it but not really to cut out shapes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

my dad did it for me with his jigsaw at his house idk what power tools we have (all teh tools we have in our basement are my uncle's fathers üòÖ )

tom might know? but i dont think we have a jigsaw

you could do the shapes in foam and attach them to the ends

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

Wattt Black Rock shooter?! 

And ye I'd get a dowel from home Depot or lowe

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah cause I wanted to keep it pretty durable



So I wanted the blue parts (the most likely parts to get HIT) in wood

And the star and accessories in worbla

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

The wings I'll have to say good luck

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah it's like a thicc piece so I imagine that that shape can be cut out of wood?

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

oop Zeikani is doing boudoirish stuff now too.

Damn bandwagons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

The boudoir, _its spreading_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

I suppose it could and built on to

Just shape cutting is a pain

Unless you have access to a like.. band saw

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

nah band saw for big bois

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

Could do it with a  hand coping saw too

But your hand will die

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

i think jig saw id for cuttin shapes

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Basically making it from wood would be difficult.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

dis is apparently called a keyhole saw, could use that i guess

look like a gun

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

_it is in fact, also a gun_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

_sword gun_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

90% of the time:
When girl followers respond to my story: actual questions like "how did you do that? Where did you get those?"
Men boy followers respond: "nice"

Bottom line: "Never give images for free"

WHOOPS.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

OOPS

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Low key hate those tips for pricing stuff. I've always been of the mindset that making others happy through what you do makes it all worth while

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

especially if its not what you do for a living

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Exactly!!!

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

I mostly appreciate respect for the time I spent on photos. Both behind the camera, planning beforehand, and developing after.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*



I wonder what happened on zeikanis story

It doesn't sound like stealing to me if someone's distributing pics of themself for free?

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Is she supposed to be rephrasing the moana recording?

Needs more context.

That's hilarious.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

~~she's so cool I'm intimidated but she's so cool I wanna shoot with her~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

Why is black fire drinking literal poison?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

~~Same though~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

He also has the other iteration with the sun hat

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

ahhhh is icarus and the sun series is to good

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Whoop I'm pinning this for a photoshoot sometime.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

Oh yeee

All good stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

What even is my blush in this picture? I didn't wear blush that day wtf?

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

https://www.facebook.com/WatchVRV/videos/1085144044966938/ *they didn‚Äôt even do the scar though*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

It's cuz I'm so cute

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

~~probably~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

That much makeup is kinda doll like though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

i mean thats kinda the intent though i think

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

I suppose. Feel like it'd be unnerving irl.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

I always thought that eyeliner that people do to purposely not line up with their eye was kinda dumb

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

is too look more anime-rific

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

Yeah it's to get that animu

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Wait, so what's going on with Sakura? Mist I saw the stories, she shouldn't let dumbasses bother her but she's justified to be salty.

There's nothing for Sakura other than she's awol for personal reasons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

didn't see anything about sakura yet

ooo you mean georgias story

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

I don't follow sakura because post storms, but she's a nice enough person I care I'd like to know what's wrong.

Still appreciate how patient she was during GB JNPR at Katsu, given how dead I was.

and Morningmist is supposed to be nice?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

Oh she said she's gonna post it publicly later but I'll tell y'all because you can keep a secret

Sakura has to put her kitty down tomorrow for health reasons

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

OH NO üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

And she just moved to New York so she's in an unfamiliar place and dealing with that

So she's pretty bummed

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

That's terrible.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

Yeah so it's just a whole conglomeration of bad stuff going on for her

_so I saw my chance to spread positivity and took it_

Both women messaged me saying they appreciated the support too, so that's good

And the harassment especially is stupid as heckie

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

The harassment is just... petty. The high road is to not let it get to you sure, but I understand why Mist is salty.

None of her followers business anyway.

I thought Sakura was originally from NY though?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

uhhh who knows

even still shes lived in boston a while it sounds like

so its not like shes coming back to much if thats the case

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

for college.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

aside from like the jesses

ye

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Unless her boyfriend is still up there, I'd say it's probably a nice change. You miss your besties when you stay longer at school. I'd know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

i think he might be but idk

his profile says hes going to more boston-located cons

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

too real

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

*aw man*.

That came from Grey.

and if I actually knew her, I have the perfect pun.

"How very black and white of you, Grey."

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

Oh.man, ye def too real, even I get those

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

~~I don't~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

It's only cuz of commenting on nerd pages

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

tru.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

~~cool and funny tomukun cosplay gets them i never would have guessed~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

I'll snoop on some accounts, the worst is the ones with no real pictures what so ever.

That's like.

a red flag.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

super red flag

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Mangaloo copied you Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

wha

hue hue mimicry is the most sincere form of flattery

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Indeed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

mangoloo REALLY loves morningmist for some reason tho

its like super obvious

like mist is her token weiss i think

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-23*

They're really good friends

Also her token Weiss is Noju/Mist,

As far as I can tell

They tend to be her big Weiss cosplayer

Also noju straight up called the account out

christ what a dick thing to do to somebody 
-finally caught up on the mist probs-

also so looking at the BNE vent chat

but I've always heard it the opposite way around 
and not from mist

about the bullying thing

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

we all  know snow is touble.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-23*

i wasn't sure if it was a typo or a pun lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

If we trust David, which I do to a degree, more than snow anyway, Snow was talking shit to Mist about Georgia.

Not something you'd do with someone whose a bully.

Snow is a contradiction and therefore a liar.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-23*

yeahhh

yeah

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Whatever her problem is, idc, but she so long as she shits elsewhere I won't deal with it.

I also wouldn't trust her with anything, let alone knowledge or my opinions.

That vent channel is a drama trap as much as shitposting on someone.

Gives people like Snow/Ethan fuel.

(so y'all should mute the heck out of it too.)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

You're not my real dad!

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

*Thank god*

I had thought for so long...

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-23*

yeah im still super weary of her, and that didnt do much to help it

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-23*

i also just don't understand... why? she brought it up

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Attention whore.

And she stirs up drama.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

BOTTOM LEFT CORNER
CROSSDRESSING IDOLS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

I watched like 3 episodes of black Butler on our honeymoon but I never got into it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

it gets better over time
but it takes a loooot of time rip
the manga is better than the anime i think. at least the first season. book of circus and book of murder were alright, and book of the atlantic was pretty neat

book of circus has a neat intro

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dybNFrCDKvM

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

How many seasons are there even?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

hmmmm
season 1 with 24 episodes and an OVA
season 2 with 12 episodes and 6 OVAs
Book of Circus with 10 episodes
Book of Murder has 2 episodes but they're like an hour long each
Book of the Atlantic is a movie

then there's a live action movie
there have been 5 different musicals and maybe more plays but i'm not too knowledgeable about them

the second half of season 1 and all of season 2 is entirely different from the manga

season 2 doesn't even exist in the manga it's an alternate ending to the series

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

*starts watching Black Butler* "how long till jumin shows up?"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*





**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

OMG

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

OH YEAH sebastian is obsessed with cats too i forgot about that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

jaehee goes to get paperwork at the office
20 cats spill out of the supply cabinet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

Poor jaehee

~~omg I have to buy another story so bad~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

*why haven't you done so yet. jess.*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

Because I can't decide who's route to do first üò≠

I keep flip flopping like I wanna do Ray's really bad but I feel like if I do Ray's I won't wanna do Vs and I wanna do Vs too so then I'm just indesisive and don't do any

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

ooooo tru. V's came out first so do his! But it's super hard not doing ray's because he's so easy ~~I assume. His route hadn't been released yet when I did V's so if you went with him you'd just get a bad end~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

Yea everyone says Ray is EZ boi cuz he's like "yay mc you're here I'm so excited!" And V is like "oh but Rika" is that accurate?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

yuuuuup
V basically sticks with Rika until the end when he's like "you know what? nevermind rika."
Ray is like "HEY MC!" from day 1

ray has great music

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

YA everyone says that and I read searans journal thing where ray is like "I cannt wait for her to get here I hope she likes me!" so I'm allready like "what a perfect bean"

V y u glutton for punishment?

Uguuuu decisions üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

Plz no üò≠üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

Drinking?!?!

üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

ya u gotta stay hydrated at a con at least drink 1 bottle of water a day

but i usually use water fountains

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

I'm prob just gonna get some form of white slipons

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

**Dave** - *2018-05-24*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

o so it's a kinky boots situation

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*





INTERESTING

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

WAS THAT TO YOU?

AGHH SHES SO CONFUSING

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

IKR

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

*who invited snow in the first place*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

has there been drama in bne :3c

wow i just read the backlog. how did that turn to this. seems like a jump

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Snow is asking for trouble to start.

This is probably the same shit she said to Mist about you.

I'd like to be sympathetic, but I can't trust Snow.

I'd make it clear you have nothing to do with who gets added to the server.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

ye isn't the person with the green username the admin

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

~~Hal?~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

the ozpin from konkon who does the cute ruby cosplay?
oh is hal the admin?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Nah your thinking Rie I think

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

hallo

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Hal is owner, Reiley has some permissions.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Nah you haven't met this one

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

ooo

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Marisa met Reiley, not Snow yeah.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

She showed up just before katsu

She's sometimes in a wheelchair and sometimes not

Not sure why exactly

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

a mystery :0

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Yeah she just kinda said that there was a reason she sometimes needed it

She's def given me the *lies for drama* vibe since the beginning

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

It's v confusing

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

I'm the one who says BNE isn't actually close friends (friends, but not like this group), but it's still bothering me to have her toxicing the place up...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

I mean she def. confusing af. and has left a bad impression from the begining, but i wouldnt say she toxicing BNE up

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Yeah I was kinda almost flipping over to trusting her more as she hadn't really done anything in a long while aside from the *vibes* and Leanna obv trusts her but..

I can't say she's wrong are lying or anything I just have a bad feeling

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

agreed. You know I trust my gut.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Plus the thing with Georgia in the beginning is so odd. When has Georgia bullied anybody?

Like seriously?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

yea. ive delt with that type before

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

Yeahhhh that was weird

I felt like that was her trying to "claim" me over mist somehow doing so??? Idk

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

And now she's turned in the reverse.

Whole thing reeks.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

i get the impression that her and mist had beef years ago and they prob both said some shit but she saw herself as innocent so she twisting it to make herself look like the only victim or something but thats alot of speculation

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

^^^^^ that's a good theory at least

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

I believe it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

on time in  my freshman yr of highschool me and these girls had a huge fight on deviant art of all things and they deleted all of thier comments making it look like me and my best friend were the aggressors, when in reality i was trying to diffuse the situation for the most part. but i almost got kicked out <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

I'm at the point where I want to comment 'enough gossip mongering' to BNE as a whole. I don't have the phrasing down right to say it though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

that was probably the biggest drama of my life

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

Based on that giveaway I did people mostly like the photos of me alone but _I do not like to be alone_

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

awww.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

Like here's the top photos again





Only three of them am I posed with another person

Though me and msginnyliz is also one of my most liked photos now too

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

I knew I should've picked the homestuck one

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Ah yes, the charts I need to be more on.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

If you wanna see the numbers

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

i think that may have been partially due to the "post your favorite picture of me" part

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*



Hmmm that's possible too

The phrasing could be biased

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

like i purposely didnt pick any why other poeple cuz i thought it was for "pictures of YOU" specifically

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

stupid Ben and his stupid good photo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

Why ARE Bens photos well received?

The yellow leaves one I get but otherwise idk

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Good tones I'd guess.

Weiss feels very pale, Pyrrha has a brightness/fall to it.

I personally like to make sure the eyes are clear in a photo, but it apparently works for him.

And there's always the 'Composition/technique means nothing if it looks cool' factor, which I'm pretty bad at acknowledging.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*





Be is Ben, Bi is Bill, C is Claire, M and J are photographers I only ran into or hired once

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

<:dva_salt:365521119534645254>

I'll be best soon.jpg.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Bestboibillam

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

I thought I had the majority for some reason, but Ben has both top image and majority. =/

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

~~But Billy's not BI~~

<@!351785752197201920>  are you cosplaying sunday at next?

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-24*

Idk really

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

üò≠

<@!245270932602486784>  wat your line up?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

I thiiiink I wanna sneak in Yang Saturday morning just for the RWBY meet up cause her make up is basically the same as Lux besides the eyebrows

So Friday is Yona/Formal Pyrrha, Saturday is Yang/Lux, and Sunday is still up in the air a bit

I could do Yurippe or Ladybug or Star or even a casual Weiss or Pyrrha depending on fatigue

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

kinda wanna squeeze in some pj JNPR but i dont remeber when hal is leaving

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

It'd need to be thursday or friday night.

Ideally, last I checked he's expecting thursday friday nights at the con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

<@!288513265661902858>  what nights you think youll be at next?

we could do casual squad sunday i suppose ü§î

but no hal üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

what do you want to do?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

All üò≠üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Do a Marisa ‚Ñ¢ 9 costumes a weekend.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

RIP

i feel like im not gonna wanna be in lulu all day too

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Do Rwby in the morning and you can go to the shoot with Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

so amny boots though

oh <@!245270932602486784>  do those boots you mentioned have heels or nah?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-24*

I'll also be doing a noragami cosplay one of the days not sure when, but <@351471675843411978> don't you and Tom have a noragami cosplay, could always be an option to meet up or something

In terms of Sunday stuff

If you're still not sure

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

Oh, what from noragami?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-24*

Kofuku

So as of rn my options for the weekend are her, futaba, and Ann (panther version)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

OMGGGG

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-24*

They have smol 1 inch heel like normal boots

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-24*

But I'd even do kofuku more than once cause one of my friends is cosplaying for her first time and really wanted to group cosplay haha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

that would be cool! more decisons ü§î

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-24*

Yeah just thought I'd throw the option in there now that I definitely know it's happening

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

even if we dont at anext we gotta do a squad at some point üôè

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-24*

Definitely!

Maybe do food or something. Idk haha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

oh yea i mean like a noragami squad, well def meet up at the con either way cuz we wanna meet you!

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

yea you are a perfectionist

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-25*

I hope my damn gold stockings come in time

Maybe I should look online just in case tonight

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

BE A PERFECTIONIST it's the only way to be

~~until you drive yourself crazy trying to be accurate orz~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

until you end up stressing yourself out too much and not having any fun doing the thing you literately do FOR FUN

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

Which I've done. You did with Adam.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

HA

you didnt see him do Leo

i think rens guns he got p.stressed too

he allready stress'n about hammer

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

Stress sesh in Georgias backyard, hold your unfinished cosplay and scream

I get stressed to a point and then I'm like fuck it

Hmmm speaking of I could probably finish Luxs outfit today if I focus

There's a guy I follow on Insta that makes cosplay and replica space suits



He only has ~200 followers but managed to be a special guest at Momocon

He sent me the files for weiss' gem that my buddy printed

I'm just like good on you, follower count doesn't dictate success

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

what his name?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

I have NO clue lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

A lesson in spray paint: appliance epoxy works awesome for plastic, doesn't do shit for suede



The plastic heel immediately took to the paint but the suede wasn't havin it, meaning I'll have to use acrylic on the suede

(Acrylic which doesn't normally work on plastic, these two materials couldn't be any more different wowee)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

Can you even paint suede?

Ooo can you bring dem boots tomorrow

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

yeee i can

theres also the shoes you claimed that my mom was getting rid of lol

ill bring all

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

Whooo! Shoe haul

Thanky

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

and yeah suede takes pretty good to acryllic

i used it for the lining on my yang jacket (which i painted instead of sewed shhhh dont tell anyone)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

Oooo neat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

me: *squints* its just pyrrha all over again

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-26*

I'm inverted, I was motivated but it gone now, but I finally made the outline for the base of the hammer

True actually they are very similar

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

it is law, only one person at a time in aurii can be motivated

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-26*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-26*

for myself and another friend for cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

"apparently"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-26*

I can't remember who it was for

but the only people I could think of I'd be doing VKS for

/with

is Cherry Blossom

or Ryan

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-27*

Hey friends, does anyone have any tips on how to keep boot covers from falling down?

**Bill** - *2018-05-27*

Either Georgia or Marisa will I‚Äôm sure. Ones driving the others sleeping.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-27*

No worries

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-27*

There's a couple options

You could sew in a thicker fabric on the inside like duck canvas

And that'll help prop it up

Also usually if you wear tights, the fabrics will have a little adhesion and the tights would help keep it up

If you're really desperate you can put Velcro on the tights and on the inside of the boot cover and Velcro them up

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-27*

Thanks for the suggestions!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-27*

Oh no <@!351471675843411978> I forgot to hand you the shoes before I left!

Also I forgot to grab the bottle caps before leaving but that's a slightly lesser travesty

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-27*

I know üò≠üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-27*

Will I see you sometime before Anext?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-27*

Nah don't worry about it I'll find something

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-27*

Wow I've posted almost everything from Katsu which means I've moved most of my Insta content

**Bill** - *2018-05-27*

You were a hot mess kid.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-28*

Super strong fashion tape and or glue might work for boots if you don‚Äôt have socks
Or elastic around the top
I like to stuff foam inside my boot covers to keep them stiff but it depends on how tall they are before it just looks clunky

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-28*

i thiiiiink i wanna cosplay ladybug for sunday of anext

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-28*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

its so annoying that anext doesnt release its schedule tho like plz

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-28*

yeah they usually release it after they get everything back from the printers but like
why can't you release it at the same time you send it off to get printed

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

Next is run poorly, but that‚Äôs not news.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-28*

truuuuuu
but most anime cons don't release their schedule until the week before or the week of

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-28*

yee, i get the finalization thing, big organizations dont usually run these (cept like anime nyc) butt

makes it hard to plan if you actually wanna do events

AND shoots

cant really complain too much tho cuz i get it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-28*

Dammit they're GLOVES?

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-28*

If I cosplay her I have to wear gloves cries I hate gloves

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

play the game first.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-28*

there's a type of paint now i hear that you can use to paint on gloves so they're compatible with smart phones

or this

https://www.amazon.com/AnyGlove-TM-Synthetic-Touchscreen-Compatible/dp/B00AB3EVOW/ref=pd_sim_229_4?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00AB3EVOW&pd_rd_r=SAVBAMV585NH6XPXQR47&pd_rd_w=uJMAm&pd_rd_wg=0BtIG&psc=1&refRID=SAVBAMV585NH6XPXQR47

I used a paint for my nowi gloves that worked pretty decently but I can‚Äôt find it on amazon anymore <:rip:369476083248267274>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

Pretty sure all Nier characters have gloves

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-28*

You could say nierly all of them wear gloves

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

that was bad.

true, but bad.

That cosplayer did a great job on the plate lines on her skin.

Makeup is a little creepy though.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-28*

They DO all wear gloves

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-28*



Another day, another useless reaction

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

Why is everything from Zenkai so fincky and bad.

It‚Äôs supposed to be getting easier with time, not harder.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-28*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Painting luxs boots and tiara killed THREE different paints somehow

My white acrylic, my white appliance epoxy, and my metallic gold spray paint

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

what the boots made of? :0

this stuff is beautiful for painting shoes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Suede!

And a plastic heel

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

oh gosh rip

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

The appliance epoxy was for the heel and the lux tiara

And the acrylic for suede

And the metallic was for the star and the tip of the boots but it DIED

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

üôÄ

leather paint would work alright on suede! but plastic ugh that stuff is awful to paint. u have the patience of a saint

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

ye appliance epoxy works real well

its what they paint fridges with

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

have u painted a fridge

do you have a gold fridge

~~paints fridge for homestuck cosplay~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

nah my appliance epoxy is white



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

did you paint your fridge white <:lenny:395307171539189760>

KAWAII

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Here's the paper version of what I did tho

THANK the worbla version is drying

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

i like how it goes under the bangs that's adorable

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Then I guess I need more gold spray paint SIGHS

Ye that's what lux's does in the game, the little wings were annoying at first but they're growing on me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-30*

don't forget your ID when buying spray paint <:lenny:395307171539189760>

can't be using it for nefarious thing now, only magical girl

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-30*

its gonna be a TRIP to convince my mom i should not work any saturdays in august

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

yeaah, you told him you were good then.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

so did i

i voted for every date that worked for me too

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

doesn't affect me, but I am curious. I remember this being a sunday plan.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Yeaaah

I think Rebecca works Saturdays too now if I recall correctly

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Something like that.

He may have the date wrong, especially since I doubt Matt‚Äôs girlfriend planned an event on a Friday.

Your saved.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-30*

Ooooo that's my birthday üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

The concept of snow talking to anyone privately just sends a shiver down my spine.

<@!245270932602486784> if you phrase as you did, makes us sound like Beach Day. =/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

i mean its a public beach vs a privately booked part of campus

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Different, since we aren't trying to run a public event privately, but still.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

yeah we dont really WANT this to be a public event

we want it to be just a large scale hangout

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

I'm going to have to point out at some point I am *not* taking photos for every person, group, and team present.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

~~team NRTH priority? üòú ~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Between the backlog, the time investment at the event, and the general mood that'll put me in I'll feel like a cheap whore.

for lack of a better term.

down child. Rebecca and Jaime are photographers.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

ye i gotchu boi

maybe rebecca and-- yeah same train of thought lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

great minds and all that.

ha. You know?

I have like, 6 cameras now.

Digital, from Ron Chicken. They're older, and not as good as my primary, but imagine loaning them out for this.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

~~now to acquire 4 more hands~~

would be kinda cool üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

I'm saying you, Jess, ~~not snow~~, anyone could pick em up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

gasp and i do know what i like to see from photos

AND I CAN DO _THE TILT_

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

I need to remember *to* do that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

AYE AYE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-30*

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

oh billiam youd be a beautiful pyrrha :>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-30*

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*



Clearly I should do that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

Do it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

Hooooly shit Megs friend Mel makes more than 1,500 a month from patreon



_i would make so much stuff if I got an extra 1,778 a **year** much less a month_

THATS 21K A YEAR OMG

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

damn

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-01*

NICU

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

It's a duo account.

~~though her being in underwear is the primary draw I'm sure~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

Damn that's so much money what the fuuuck

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

welp

time to wear wigs in my undies

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

They do have to pay for all these prints they give out as tier rewards.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

and quit ma job

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

I KNOW LIKE _time to get nekkid_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

ok keep ma job

and wear wigs in my undies

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

True but also she got so much money she went to another whole con states away so

That's still pretty nuts

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

It's a lot of money for an 'amatuer' patreon, ye.

Wonder if they're a couple, otherwise they probably split the income.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

he makes props or?

<@!351785752197201920>  joint patreon when?

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

Prop maker, from the looks of it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

we could make lewd otp pics together

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

Yo, accentkisses feed looks terrible though. I dunno if all the photos are heavily filtered, but they look terrible.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-01*

Tbh lewds are what really sells no matter the quality from what I've seen

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

YEET

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

~~whoops I respect women~~

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-01*

Especially if you offer like lewd snap or skypes

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

*more like care about photo quality* üòÖ

And looking at the comments, it's because she's just trying to get people to hit up patreon.

I am unimpressed.

~~tbh she isn't even cute~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

omg i get creeped out on my regular account i couldn't imagine sending snaps and skypes

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

me either. Cause who actually uses skype, it's 2018.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

ok yea thats not the problem lmao

~~i rarely send lewd to my own husband~~ i couldn't image sending them to random dudes

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-01*

I feel ya with that

I don't have enough confidence for it either lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

I feel like patreon would feel like selling out for me

And would kinda be the point where cosplay isn't just a fun hobby anymore

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

Don't turn your hobby into a job, yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

_frustrating as fuck tho like damn I could be out here makin 2K just rolling around in my underwear_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-01*

Hahahaha

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

you aren't going to be broke forever~

I know that'a s foreign concept, but I thought the same thing a year ago.

~~also if you do a lewd patreon just for the money, isn't that effectively prostitution in a way?~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

i may not be broke but i could still be making 2K extra a month

LOL as if

maybe like $500

nah prob like 20 cents and an old eraser

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-01*

Lmao those are two different things

Exotic dancerdoesnotequal prostitute

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*



Yeah, so that‚Äôs like the same shot I did with Georgia and Gen. total copyright infringement, if it wasn‚Äôt also at Katsu.

~~I may have shot crappy at Katsu and I might be biased given it was Georgia and Gen, but I‚Äôd say mines a lot better~~

And this is from inoue, the one with the 185 dollar package.

180217 Katsu 2434.jpg

https://flic.kr/p/24F8Zr8

~~in hindsight they aren't that similar but point stands, her photo ain't worth 185 bucks~~

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-01*

She's charging $185 for that?!

Not worth at all lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

Yeah what the heck me and Gen did it way smoother

Dare I say our schneester interactions look more natural

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*



Is this like, a meme?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

ye it is

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Gotta double check my email but I don't think so

I think last I checked everything should be on the way

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

anyone else looking in BNE üëÄ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Yeee..

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

what the heck

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

I... Don't even know man

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

i wish i could hear about her from another source goddamn

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Exactly

Like aight... This girl bullying snow is clearly immature as hell

But the *why* snow is what's got me

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

me too!

and i did a photoshoot with that girl messaging her last year, she wasnt malignant or anything

and shes friends with people Meg is friends with, and i trust Megs judgement of friends

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Like why some *wheelchair girl* 

I think snow is leaving a lot of previous bad blood out

Like she probably really got into it at some point with morning mist and fought with her, then played the victim and did the woe is me thing

Then switched friend groups but morning mist is still mad

But I doubt snow is completely innocent

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

oh yeah so do i

theres no way shes 100% the victim

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

We've already caught her playing the victim AND lying, so its... Rough

*and the reason I don't think she needs a wheelchair and uses one to make people feel bad for her*

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

This is getting way too middle school for me though. I don't want to be involved on any side.

I get an off vibe from Mist too, after following her for awhile.

I don't particularly like either of them, and I trust my gut.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

i mean its possible she has a problem like weak ankles or something; she may need it for long distances. though it IS weird she didnt have one at all at zenkai

(then again it costs money to rent a wheelchair so she may be skimping on costs and forcing herself to power through, who knows)

yeah i dont really care for either of them but i know the value in playing nice

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Or she had a recent operation around Katsu and has recovered.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Yeah I can't say for certain anything

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

im just here to dress up and take pictures, thats it üò§

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Just that she *still* gives me... The **Vibes**

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Exactly, we do pleasantries with Snow, I don't plan on meeting Mist anytime soon, and stay the fuck out of their nonsense.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Mist was there after the katsu formal... WITH snow if I remember correctly

Unless she was just following her

Blehhh I don't like the whole thing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

yeah its messy

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Legit sounds like highschool like...

Like freshman level

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-02*

I'm lurking only today

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

yeah

_i dont like that my name was dropped_

_by either side_

if anyone messages me ill just say im not informed enough to be involved so i elect to stay out of it

though no one has messaged me directly

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

YEP I thought the same

*My new best friend georgia will beat you up*

When you aren't involved at all

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

oh ffs. I missed that part.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Ugghhhhh this whole thing is so immature, both sidesssss

Just fucking block her and don't talk to them, it's so simple

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

This is *going* to come to a head at RTX, not too late to baiiiil...

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

The name dropping is like.. kid stuff, like "I know this cool popular person so you can't tell me what to do"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

~~im cool?~~

~~yeah i guess if im running the rtx shoot i must be cool~~

but yeah its hella immature

which is SO WEIRD cause i literally took photos with that girl and she was nothing but nice

and shes mutual friends with people Meg is really good friends with

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

and mangaloo is nothing but nice.

in the sense her public persona isn't her whole person.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

from what rtx people said last year, mangaloo is nice, but very shy and quiet in actuality

i feel like she chooses to be friends with mist out of good judgement?

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

If Casey's ruby personality was her actual personality, I wouldn't follow her. I support the (apparent) quiet girl. Not ms insta famous.

I don't know, I don't know Casey and I don't know Mist. Which in a nutshell, means avoid this drama as fast as possible.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

true facts

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

The only reason I'm not going to forget about it entirely is you getting dragged in.

Dealing with ~~Ethan's~~ Snow's Drama: Electric Boogaloo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

ELECTRIC BOOGALOO

yeah im gonna be wary

hmmmm mist and mangaloo have been nothing but nice to me in the couple interactions with them

if anything id be more suspicious of snow tbh

cause right off the bat she sucked me into the drama

huh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Yeah...

:Elfriede_Sigh:

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

elfriede sigh is the perfect mood for such a situation lmao

~~actually i dont think elfriedes sighed in a while~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Oh yeah, I don‚Äôt think Snow is innocent. Nor will I claim Mist and Casey are instigators.

But since you don‚Äôt really know Mist and Casey, stay out of it until you‚Äôve got all the information verified with your own eyes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

_all i can trust at RTX is Hal_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

~~Elfriede sighed last post~~

~~Nah ya know what, I'll message both mist and and snow and just start bullying both of them~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Probably Gen and Chris too. Stick with them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

OH TRUE

speaking of gen, i havent seen her start pyrrha yet

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CPR904NdUgri07SxxUB8UdrAjihn_YSebvBo5F-yDcU/edit#gid=0

look at this color coordinated pack list

how KAWAII

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Oh yeah, she plans on doing it in like a month or two. I didn't have the heart to tell her she'll never manage it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Wtf why does shit always happen when I'm working

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

cause you work in prime Drama Time‚Ñ¢

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Ugh 
It's all so petty 
I personally trust mist over snow but god this is stupid af

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

Bae RTX is a warzone youre the only one i can trust

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Bae I can and will tell people to duck off just so you know

If problems arise at the shoot I will try to peacefully resolve them for you

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

dis why youre a good boi

also yes gen and chris are definitely trustworthy

most of the rtx room is actually?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Yeah they aren't drama mongers

Ugh

I feel like BNE is bashing and I don't like ittttt

I want to comment but my breaks ending and I really shouldnttt

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

leanna and erik took neutral approaches

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Yeah I know but Heather, Jamie, Monica aren't
And I feel like mark wants to deal with it papa style 
I'll see where this is at later and decide if I need to comment later

Ok, break over TTYL

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

bye bae ‚ù§

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

BNE is bashing, because Snow has turned herself into the group victim. I see no way to go about calling that out without more drama. This is going to start driving BNE apart too.

We‚Äôre not close to everyone in BNE, it‚Äôs not a close group of friends. We can‚Äôt treat it as such.

*whoop Jaime did a passive aggressive story post*

Gen is shooting with LTD on location noooo das sketchhhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

DAMN I WAS ABOUT TO MESSAGE THAT

hopefully shes taking someone with her

i feel like shes rational enough to do so

he wasnt a creepy dude just awkward so

also im glad she looks like shes breaking out nora again? and rob didnt ruin renora for her

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Yeah that sucks when people do couple cosplays only to never touch them again

Like Rebecca's holo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

_no one could ever ruin arkos for me_

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

I warned Gen about LTD at Zenkai.

Just that he gives me bad vibes.

She said she knew what she was doing, so.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

yeah i trust her

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Yeah Gen is smart

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

You don‚Äôt have to worry about anyone ruining Arkos, you already got it. XD

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

I feel like she'd stab a bitch if she had to

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

~~oh no i have to wife helium~~

oh gen totally would

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Tom you already got Jess to cos waifu CC, when you getting her to be Holo? <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

GOOD POINT

Although Holo isn't as high on my waifu list, I feel like she should be considering she had a way better personality

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

see posted a driving selfie, and wasn‚Äôt driving. Probably has Chris with her. Whew.

~~But do you need some many transit selfies~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

ye thats what i did for a couple lux things

theres always time to remake it later down the line

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-04*

Yeah I can always repaint it

I think the structural part is on the decent side it's mostly the paint

My foam cutting and dremeling skills could def use work tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

it ok its an acquired skill

moar cosplay will help you learn lmaoo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-04*

**just do it til you hate yourself**

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Question what does NPD stand for

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

in what context?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Never mind found out

In relation to snow

Apparently it stood for narcissistic personality disorder

@angryjigglypuff really went off on her wow

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

oh boy

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

what, in this chat for RTX?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

No go to her insta

Its one of her story highlights

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

So Snow admitted to be being behind some of the Mist bashing?

I didn't listen to any of the video segments.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

She admitted to helping the people start and use the accounts

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

If you are going to take a public, negative action against someone, you'd best be ready for people to give it right back to you.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Yeahhhhh
She claims she didn't have anything to do with the accounts after the fact 
But that stanks  of bullshit 
Also apparently somebody gave out mists  number 
And imma side with the jigglypuff cause that's not something just anybody would have

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Jigglypuff I assume, unless Casey is somehow involved. üòõ

I don't know, and I just want nothing to do with it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Yeah

Ugh

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

So long as Georgia doesn't get roped in, let them rip each others hair out.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

üëç

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

are either of them going to anext?

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Don't think so.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Jigglypuff definitely isn't

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

This is *going* to hit the fan at RTX.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Yeah

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

~~bail nowwwww~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

Smack a bitch with WORDS



Lux is DIS FAR

I just gotta do the gold on top of the socks, probably redo the Vest (but this is a back up just in case), and then bust out the staff

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Redo the best?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Why you gonna redo the bust?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

the material is pretty meh

(also dont worry theres no midriff out, theres a white shirt underneath)

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

As if midriff is unusual for you, Yang/Pyrrha.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

I wouldn't worry about it now though üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

~~I just want to know if best means vest or bust~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

vest lmao

and yeah but i know ill be miserable later

and i have to time and money to remake it

~~and i know itll bother me and ill just wanna change out of lux as soon as possible cause of the vest~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

It‚Äôs her Adam wig.

**Dave** - *2018-06-04*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

time to make a packing list finally

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

Yo I'm about to go out and get fuckin bullied, morningmist has gotten like 300 followers in the last week

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

wot
hacks
~~who's morningmist~~

2 more until 200 forever :3

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

:3c

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

tom we can bully each other to get more followers believe me its an excellent idea

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

elementary school says bullying is wrong
what if you get reported

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

ill shit talk on my story

tomukuns boobs are fake boom

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

omg that's social murder

the fanboys will go rabid

that would be a funny april fool's day thing.
"hey guys wezrez here i'm actually a dude"
photoshop some HUGE muscles and abs on yourself

do you still need new versions of pyrrha to cosplay because



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

Ah muscle fetishes,they sure are something

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Pity followers are not he good kind of followers we were talking about Georgia.

And Casey has taken a public stance of support for Mist. Wonderful, at RTX Mist will be bodyguarded by her and her entourage. If Mist is as innocent as she says she is, I dunno, but I know Jake does a lot of policing for Casey and Casey isn‚Äôt an idiot, so that speaks for something. 

I do not put it past Snow to want her Instagram famous friend wezrez to help her out, or throw you under the bus in some way as shit hits the fan. You‚Äôll be in an extremely political situation, I‚Äôm worried for you. Be careful with the lot of it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

What‚Äôs the deal with mist what‚Äôs the 411 what‚Äôs the skinny

New phone who are these people

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

I gotta leave for work, if someone else doesn‚Äôt get you the deets I‚Äôll share then.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

Apparently there was just this whole cycle of bullying between morningmist and crescentbladed

And all their friends seem to have gotten dragged into it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

Not surprising

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

Oh nooo

So why is that bad for you? Are they bullying you because if so I shall bully them

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôs going to get pulled in.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

ye its a big ol drama clusterfuck

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

Fight the power 
I would assume if she doesn‚Äôt say anything about it she won‚Äôt get pulled in. In an ideal world

I just walked past someone in Lolita
People who do Lolita coords are hardcore so if you get dragged into the fight get some Lolita coorders to back you up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

fight fight fight

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

Lolitas will absolutely wreck things up

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

~~nah thats me~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

üò≠

noooooo

~~i just like to draw pictures and drink~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

georgia if someone tries to mess with you send them this



**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Yes, send them a picture of Marisa.

None one's going to directly mess with Georgia though, it's more she's the shoot runner at RTX and the shoot at RTX is where Mist and Snow are most likely to duke it out.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

be sure to film it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

Ruby v Weiss: wrestle mania smackdown

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

do you think they actually physically fight?

girls fights are brutal

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

Nah there's no waaaay

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

And mess up their cosplays?!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

the strongest cosplays are battle functional

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

im not hip on the drama lingo. what is doxxing?

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

I had to google it.

releasing private information publicly without consent.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

ooo like phone numbers and addresses and shit?

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

In Mist's case it was her phone number, yeah.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

o yeah doxxing someone is basically
"hey guys xXxNoobxXx420's real name is Joe and he lives at 69 Meme Street in California and works at Sears"

does releasing a phone number count as doxxing too
i've only ever heard it used to refer to name/address/place of work

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

It's pretty fucked up.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

ughh i cant do drama

i just shut down

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

This is mean girls level of drama.

Not that I've seen that movie.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

it's such a classic though

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Pointing being, stay out of the disaster zone.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

i think it's on netflix

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

dont have to tell me XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

this is it this is instagram drama
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVN7TJRRskQ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

too true

"if someone says something bad about you, you'd wanna know right?"
"no"

ME

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-05*

Idea for everyone: just get rid of all the toxic people in your life and live a drama free life~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

im too old for that shit. I try my best to stay 9000 miles away from it

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Snow's just part of a group we're all in, we can't cut her out of that. Beyond the group no one cares for her.

Mist lives in Atlanta, we're just following the insta shit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

it's really easy to impulse buy costumes here I've already bought 2 this week please stop me

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

UNDERSTANDABLE

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-05*

Ah gotcha. Just like a piece of advice I've been living by lately

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

But thyey cheaper right?

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

They're like, what, 10 bucks?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

bring me back to the US where we pay for cosplay in blood

ye

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

That's like saying buying a soda from a vending machine is an impulse buy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

i bought saber's school uniform and kuriyama mirai since i've cosplayed from both of those series before. was gonna get a love live (yume no tobira dress) but decided against it because that song is meh. they were $20 apiece. saber could've been cheaper but i figured i was already there

there's a suzaku costume i want for $15 (knight of rounds uniform) but it's an XL so it might be too big
~~maybe i should buy it anyway and just take it in~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

hell, ship it to Tomu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

TOM U WANNA BE SUZAKU

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

~~code geass squad when~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

not that he could wear an XL either.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

it's missing a piece, i think the inner shirt but that's easy peasy, and it doesn't have the cape but capes are easy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

tom is stilla  small/medium even in asian sizing

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

i have no idea how sizes work here
sometimes medium fits me but I usually go for large and those fit

code geass squad when

who's gonna cosplay what

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

You three are the only ones whove seen it I think?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

have you not seen code geass

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

I have, I just don't cosplay. :V

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

that's a staple. a classic. i've seen it 5 times

be orange

i want to cosplay CC as Zero but that mask would be a pain so maybe. not.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

~~one day i will be tom's ultimate waifu~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

*Tom bleeds out via nosebleed*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

actually thats just my excuse to eat pizza hut all day

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

*Tom starts bleeding from ears*

*"My wife... is my waifu...? My waifu... my wife?"*

*Tom's head explodes*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

I have everything for this version now:

cut thats like super basic

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

Âúü„ÅÑÔΩî

Oops

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

~~Or maybe she already has for Tom~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

could do it this weekend if i reaaaally wanted to but ill prob save for colossal since thats naked con

no actually lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

look at these prices hhhhhh

it's a shame all the ones i want are costumes i already have

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

i wanna do this outfit http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0808/7195/products/Commission_Request_Code_Geass_C.C_Cosplay_Costume_CP178678_1_grande.png?v=1484297107

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

YEAH that a cool outfit

i wanna do this one but there was a girl at katsu who absolutely nailed it a few years back

there was a little incident at the code geass shoot but overall it was ok

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

üòÆ

bonus: if i cosplay CC i have another use for my expensive yellow contacts <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

~~The ones you can't see out of?~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

a younger girl (obviously teen or pre-teen) was dressed as CC I think and one of the Lelouch's went too far posing with her. I can't remember if she just felt uncomfortable posing or if he kissed/nearly kissed her but she wound up in tears. the lelouch wasn't trying to be malicious and was super apologetic, I want to say he even asked for permission first although i can't recall 100%

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

i can see just not as well as normal contacts

AHHH üò≠

das sad üò¶

i can only cosplay yellow eyed, green eyed, or light blue eyed characters accurately cuz contacts are expensive as hell for me <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

ye it's the girl on the left (that lelouch next to her isn't the one who made her uncomfortable it was an emperor lulu)

forgo contacts
utilize photoshop <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

hmm i wonder how old she was

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

the katsu code geass shoots are awesome

i want to say like maybe 12 or 13 or so

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

oh wow

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

but she wasn't with anyone she was by herself

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

Couldn't tag Snow in the RWBY pic I posted



Looks like she deleted

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

she left BNE.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

Oh boy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

oH I didn't see THAT one

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

Lmao WTF

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Man, I hope she isn't going dark on Leanna. That'd be a bitch move.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

I.. wouldn't doubt it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

Leanna said in her story that she is taking a short hiates unstil after the weekend ( her being Leanna)

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

After the angry jigglypuff expose Snow can't spin innocence.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

Never looked at Jigglypuff story

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

It really rips into Snow not gonna lie

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

I only read the DMs, but... yeah.

How old is Snow?

And her Facebook is gone too.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-05*

She's at least 21

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Worried about Leanna now... Particularly that Snow dropped her like a sack of bricks. I think my asking would come off nosy but maybe asking Erik to check on her...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

id let it go for now

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-05*

Idk the extent of the drama, but I would suggest not getting too involved with it unless it directly affects you. I would hate to see any of you be stuck in the drama too

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Drama girl is the one who ghosted out. She just got together with Leanna though. I‚Äôm only concerned Leanna got hurt.

As a side effect.

But you are right Jess. We‚Äôll see her at Next.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

well fitting clothes are nice.

Story time for this Mist/Snow stuff, for anyone whose not caught up:
```
Pre Mist:

* Snow was invited to BNE (cosplay group Georgia, Hal, Marisa, Jess, Tom, and I are part of, RWBY cosplayers) by Erik before Katsu. Her actual name is Jenna, she goes by Snow with everyone though. Instagram was crescentbladed.

* Our friend David from the con circuit messaged Hal that Snow was telling MorningMist Georgia was a bitchy person, stuff like that. Turned myself and others here off to Snow. Georgia sent a nice message to Mist and resolved any effects of the rumor mongering. 

* At Katsu, Snow used a wheelchair. The wheelchair (which was supposed to be a need) has never been seen since. This has been noticed and the theory is passed around that she had the wheelchair for sympathy.

* After Katsu Snow was a member of BNE, which was fairly quiet. Out of sight out of mind.

* At Zenkaikon last month Snow and Leanna got together officially, Leanna being another member of BNE. 
```

``` Mist stuff:

* Morningmist had numerous accounts credits that were image after image saying "Morningmist is a bully". Dms were also sent to her from throwaway accounts. Mist received support from various people in the instagram world, and fans of hers reported the accounts attacking her. 

* Snow expressed during this that mist was actually a bully; Mist bullied her in the past. No details came out on what occurred between them, though I believe the phrase 'it takes two to tango' applies.

* Mist continued to get this accounts for awhile. 

* Snow received DMs from a friend (angryjigglypuff) of Mist's accusing her of being involved in the character attacks. The details of which are now on angryjigglypuff's instagram. Snow panicked to BNE, who supported Snow. 

* The DMs eventually reveal Snow was involved, but 'not the ringleader'. Snow brought Georgia up when jigglypuff told Snow not to come to Georgia's RWBY RTX shoot. Snow said Georgia was her friend and implied Georgia wouldn't support kicking Snow out of the shoot as Jigglypuff suggested. 

* Snow deleted all social media today asides from a tumblr with a suicide note. She left Leanna in the lurch, who called the police who confirmed Snow is fine. 

* Currently BNE supports Snow, believing Snow in that Mist is the real bully. 

* Various figures in the cosplay community (Mangaloo for one) support Mist, not directly against Snow but in that Mist is a good person. 
```

Mainly for Marisa, or anyone else who wants to enjoy the shit show. If I'm missing details let me know.

I personally think, based on what I know of the two, they're both problems. Mist strikes me as manipulative and/or catty, Snow bitchy and a drama whore. I've never met Mist, and I avoid Snow when I can, but I trust my gut.

or just really want none of this shit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

David likes Mist so thats always a plus

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

I'm a salt machine and more bitter than would have thought, but drama is beyond me.

That's true.

Additional information:
I had been informed about snow bullying Morningmist from David before katsucon, I also got some nonspecific info about the bullying from morningmist at katsu over dinner with her David and another girl I can't remember

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

finally! lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-11*

WE OBEY

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-11*

new role for jess in BNE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

oh no XD

"and thats how i accidentally started a cult when i was just trying to make a reference"

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Ah, so roles in BNE Hal. I can't do this but it needs to be done, I realized it when Ginny invited her Erik in. Every single role has permissions, so everyone can do invite links. We don't need the drama of a scenario where Ginny invites her friend TJ, who is Gen's ex she actively avoids. What you need to do is remove permissions from every role that only exists for the color. The only roles that should give permissions are `everyone`, and Reiley/mine/Georgia's roles because we are intended to have them. Every other role should give no permissions at all, they'll inherit permissions from `everyone`.

Georgia and I fixed Ginny's roles to not have instant invite to avoid the specific example, but it should be done for everyone.

God forbid more trouble in BNE.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-11*

I'll go through it all in a bit

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I love how Jake and Casey do those little cell phone shoots when they go to day cons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072XJNJ34/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

this brand i used for both my thigh highs all weekend

they were nice and thick and didnt fall down too much, i only pulled them up like once or twice during the whole day

this has been a PSA

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

now toms gonna order me 14 pairs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

hap birth here are 28 socks

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

he would though

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-11*

I would tho

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

He did tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

<:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

AaaaAAAALLLLLright.

I got a notification before Zekani posted to the colossal east group looking for a room.

I got a DM before I got on the subway from her with a lead in to that.

‚ÄúAre you going‚Äù and I can infer.

Uh?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

yea i saw that post

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I‚Äôve had two 5 minute conversations with her, and a handful of Instagram exchanges. My inclination is nope if it does go the way I expect.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

its your room brah, up to you. we have alot of space still right?

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I mean, right?

Yeah we do.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

ok, i told justin and rayna wed have space if they manage to get off

you dont know her v. well so

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

For now. Ashley and Dan was discussed, as is Brandon and Lizi.

( <@!279360609416642561> you guys wanna come to colossal east?)

No I don‚Äôt.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

yea i mean obvi it would not be open forever

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

People I don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt ~~acknowledge~~ ask me for anything, and I can‚Äôt imagine rooming with effective strangers personally. So I‚Äôm just confirming my reasoning here.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

oh yea i wouldnt either if i were you. ned to know someone a lil better or at least have them be friend of a close friend

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Exactly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

whats happenin

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Read.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

zeikani needs a room for colossal east?

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

ehhhh

yeah i dont know them well enough

i dont think i do at least

tho we are mutuals so im not uncomfortable rooming with them id just rather not

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I turned her down, someone clued her in to a group of people looking for roommates so that should help her.

Mutuals on instagram is not friendship, certainly not trusting someone to sleep in the same room as you imo.

#virgo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

Omg

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Fuck real photos, I should spend all my time making memes.

*"I am an abused sad boi"*

*"But it's what gets me laid!"*

Can you stop memeing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

OMFG

i love these

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Got another, but has spoiler caption.

That one goes to DM, since you going to play right?

Did not make it all the way through Friday. Close.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

i cant use a song in my vlog cause itll only be the soundtrack for sunday and its too good for that

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Sunday was lit tho. Much more so than the typical Sunday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

Omg these are great

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

was just talking to Mom, saying how I take alot of pictures but I took half as many as I did last year at Next. 4000 last year, 2000 this year.

I want to compare though, I think it's more like I only need half as many photos to get the good ones, rather than I'm getting less good ones.

Gotta finish the collection set.

<@!141729881779077121> Ryouma has some *BALLER* shots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

memes always win

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-12*

does it hurt worse? it should fade over time but if it starts feeling worse i'd get it checked up

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

~~but then you have to explain to a doctor why you were doing it in the first place~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

like the same i guess

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

irony maybe?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

what process should we suggest for nominating people to the BNE august shoot?

cause id love to invite kirsten, but only to the event not really the discord

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

_i have the power?_

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

You always did. So does everyone else. I told everyone this.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

im still doing my research on PO boxes

theres one in wickatunk (which is like an old town that got absorbed into my town, marlboro) for 15 for 3 months

or i could get one by rutgers for 39 for 3 months

i like having it in highland park (by rutgers, but not in new brunswick itself) cause its VERY anonymous as to where i actually live

but still at college, so while i take summer classes, its close enough to visit

(though when summer classes end july 20th ill have to go out of my way to go there)

wickatunk is 9 mins from my house but idk im lowkey paranoid about people seeing that its in that town and deducing that i live in marlboro

am i being needlessly paranoid?

i suppose i could also go like three towns over to matawan or something

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

Either that or Rutgers. How often are you really going to visit the thing anyway.

~~or don‚Äôt~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

maybe once every two weeks or so

I MEAN i def wanna get one

at least to try out for 3 months

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

Well, to add to paranoia they‚Äôd know you go to Rutgers. You live there 9 months of the year.

But hell, don‚Äôt ask me. I don‚Äôt like it personally. I‚Äôm biased.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

I _could_ get one by my work

which no one would know i work near there cause i dont mention work and dont intend to

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

That‚Äôs not a bad thought.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-13*

go for a really convoluted path. get a PO box in, like, north dakota but set up automatic forwarding to another PO box in Florida which will forward your mail to a PO box in New Jersey that you have to pick up

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-13*

yeah by work would prob be the best for anonymity

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

why am i looking at plans for lotor cosplays? someone tell me this is bad idea

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

it's terrible idea.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

is it? or are you just saying that

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

I dunno, do you want to go into a bathtub of purple dye to get your skin the right color?

Then go to work the next day still looking a tad off color?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

its only the face

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-13*

Dressed up as Drizzt then go to the Voltron shoot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

ü§î

YES

hmmmm whos armor would be harder?

drizzt i can prob take some creative liberty with

as long as i have black body and green cape with fur trim

wouldnt have to be AS dark for lotor though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

Body paint isn't THAT bad

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

i could reduce lotor down to a body suit if i wanted to go easy way out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

How much skin he show

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

just face

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

Oh yeah that's not bad at all then

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

yea its less than full raven would be

~~which i should probably do before anything else~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

If I use my new lens for portraits, it'd look like that.

(I didn't get it for that)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

WOO BLURRED BACKROUND

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

*did you notice how her head is egg shaped?*

**Dave** - *2018-06-13*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

Oh I thought that was just her head

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

me too lmao

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

ye, 500mm is too much, it compresses unnaturally.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*



Aw das a cute header

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

wait, is she in that?

I see I didn't need to @ you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

üëçüòéüëç

And no she's not in that pic which I thought a little funny

It IS such a cute pic tho

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

you like it cause you in it. üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

ITS ALSO CUTE

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

~~because your JNPR is in it~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

YEEEE

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

finally honest.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-14*

I'm pretty sure she might be that nora

Maybe

But yeah that us üòé

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

IH YEAH SHE MIGHT BE THE NORA

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-14*

I remember seeing her I think she is

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

<@!351471675843411978> does chill pickle still message you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

not recently ü§î

you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

S I G H still messaging me

And I try to dodge the convo with really lame responses

But he keeps asking questions to purposely further the convo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

oh man i was hoping he had given up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

And I'm like ahhhh ~~I don't wanna befriend you ho~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

stop replying.

it's not rocket science.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

But that's rude

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

he hasn't taken the hint. isn't that rude? Also better he go find something productive to do.

for his own sake.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

I guess he spends his whole day messaging Instagram people like wtf

Too many people are like "hi can we be friends" and it's like UGH

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

you've got a kiss shot somewhere with Hal, go post that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

They ain't even tryna fuk but I don't wanna be their friends either

Like no offense to them but no thanks

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

Then *don't reply after the first few exchanges*.

more replies == the person thinking you actually want to respond.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

I literally take days to respond like three words and they don't care

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

yea i get where you are coming from cuz it does feel rude

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

sorry, I just don't get it. I'd rather get no reply.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Cause you're rational Bill

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

for me its more like "what are they going to do if i dont answer"

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

*who cares*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

creepy guys can get over zealous very fast

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

Then there's a block button? It's just a waste of time, for all parties involved.

I'd rather Grey have snubbed my friend request whenever the fuck that was, because I wouldn't have had to bother.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

im just paranoid about running into them at a con or someshit idk

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

You don't travel alone at cons anyway.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

ü§∑

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Ya but it's still awkward

Like "why did you block me"

What does one even say, like, "your attempts at friendship annoyed me"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

Yea and that doesn't exactly feel right

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

ALSO HES SO TWO FACED CAUSE HE JUST WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND

like he said he hates how busy he is and I was like idk I like to be busy and he was like me too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

What üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

He‚Äôs trying to get with you kappa

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Eugh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

Yooooo

He unfollowed me üòÇ

What did I doo?! Lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Omg did you stop answering?

He changed his name to nerf_lucio I think

Which, other than his username being completely false and dumb, I don't really care and still call him pickle

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

Ohhhh nvm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

_cursed pickle_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

Yea he still follows me I didn't realize he changed his name

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Zeikani messaged me to tell me that my cheekbones are awesome

Sweet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

üëå

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

Nani the heck.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

pickle does not follow me üëå females only, Obey Lady Whoozica

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

<@!351785752197201920>  did you see this sona last year at CCE? https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/35299182_10156368433929854_3786179577420709888_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=648e8c8ba6bdf5cef947aa1a8e92c3f2&oe=5BACE7B4

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

<@!184437198865563648> confirmed that it was steamdumpling at Anext



**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Mhmm.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

I can't figure out what skin that is in the back right

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

how she make a keyboard pool float?

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

might have bought it.

I can imagine some site made those.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-15*

is it a real pool float? :0 hard to tell 100%

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

i think so? cut it bubble at the top

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-15*

tru. that can be done with plastic too. there's an odd seam at the side but now that i look at it again it's likely the wire that holds it up when posing

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Fuck.

New Problem: The jpaden photo is good.

Too good.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

That's not a problem Billiam

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

~~it is for me~~

wait no the white balance is funky, and it's technically oversharpened even if it's passiable.

Eyes just look really good.

crisis averted.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

That's like me saying " oh that 2b cosplay is so good that's a problem"

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

It's not a problem THAT photographer took a better shot than I could. It's a problem that I haven't taken a better shot than THAT yet.

no ill will to the other guy.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

I think it's the same thing üòÇ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

Ye!

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I find motivation to improve, rather than feel the other guy has wronged me by being better.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

^^^ that makes sense

I think the eyes are edited tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

**Bill** - *2018-06-16*

ah okay, yeah, that cringe.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-16*

What does that even mean heusbvdkkfhsgvfjdbhf

**Bill** - *2018-06-16*

probably supposed to be 'in response' to her 'are you ready for murderous ice cream'.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-16*

Ughgggghhghh

Poor Gen

**Bill** - *2018-06-16*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-17*

**Bill** - *2018-06-17*

Similar shit, sexualizing Gen.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-18*

She can file a report or a copyright claim. It worked when someone reposted my pictures

It looks like he isn‚Äôt even getting them off her insta but a third party instagram-searching site

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-18*



this was on a thumbnail for a suggested youtube video for me

thats actually a really cool idea for a cover up for Colossal East??

**Bill** - *2018-06-18*

Yeah.

I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôd do a Weiss/Pyrrha one.

Rather than play Rwby bingo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-18*

yeah no ruby for me lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-18*

That‚Äôd be a cute look tho.

I'd say there are better Mojojoj designs to do tho. Uniforms are easy I guess tho.



Good photo sure, buttttt low key steamdumpling doesn‚Äôt have legs.

(The Yang)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-19*

Omg true



Can't walk around RTX in horrible heels like last year, so I'm gonna make some new ones with a chunkier heel

The small heel ones are canon but I CANNOT deal with cons in such tiny heels anymore

Plus I doubt anyone will notice

thank

o so fin isn't the one being called out ok. i was trying to think like "what would she be called out for" but she's just involved in it

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Ye, Finn is the one of the harassees.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

what even

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

It's not a really well put together call out tho. Usually the evidence is well presented.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

i wanna read the rest of the messages from her, but like it seems that hes butthurt she doesnt wanna be friends

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Yeah, he's a dick but like, lots of people are dicks.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

seems to your average alpha male bs

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

to take him down you must defeat him in hand to hand combat

i can't wait to see cosplays of this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

YAS omg

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

why are all my fave characters that i wanna cosplay from obscure manga no one knows of

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

cuz you read so many mangos

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

i have narrowed it down...... to 4 that i will start with once i get regular use of a sewing machine........ but if i don't find another before these 4 are done i'mma start doing characters no one knows

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

are you going to get a sewing machine for your apartment or is this for when you get home?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

when i get home. sewing machines here are super expensive and we literally have like 50 of them at home.
bojo asked if she should send me a little hand machine that looks like a stapler and sews, we have a few of those but then I'd spend too much money on fabric and waste too much time

~~which can wait until i'm back in the US~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

yeeee

Come home.

I don't even know the middle two.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

lizzie and raphtalia
raphtalia is from an anime whose trailer came out last year but there haven't been any updates since ü§î

also it's in english for some reason hehe
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjezREyZI2U

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

black butler!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

did you and tomu watch any yona last night

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

YE 2 eipsodes

they got blue boi

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

blu: obtained

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

hes adorable

now they gonna go get green boi

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

I thought black bulter was about guys.

I meant gays, but yes.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*



pure boy. now they're going after sin boy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

OOO

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

kuroshitsuji is messed up it's about a lot of things.

lots of murder and genocide involved

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

and here i thought it was about some whinny kid and a butler

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

it also has a ton of female nudity like even though 12 year olds like it it's definitely not for kids

sebastian sleeps with beast when infiltrating the circus so the anime has a very naughty scene of that

beast is a chick

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

~~not male nudity?~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

not really.

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

I'm confused.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

oh the wolf guy is nude a lot but he dies quickly. meanwhile there are like 3 or 4 girls regularly shown being assaulted or just not wearing clothes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

üò±

jeez i was way off

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

This show had fangirls like crazy, what. I thought it was guy abs and that's why they all wanted to be the little boy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

~~sounds like they'd rather be that beast girl~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

it's dark <:lenny:395307171539189760> girls love murder and dark stuff
there are shounen-ai undertones at parts? but nothing concrete. ciel (main chara boy) has a fiance, sebastian (butler) sleeps around to get intel a few times.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

you right

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*



Did someone say *wata flowa*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

oooooooo

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Whoops I buzzkilled the horse idea.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-20*

I was thinking the same thou

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

But you leave me to say it and be the smarmy bastard? <=P

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

Smarmy?

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Kinda like snarky.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

i uhhh dont know what to say to that

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

I still lean no right now, assuming none of my concerns become an issue. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll suggest Rebecca for it. If you guys go for RNJR I‚Äôd go with you and shoot from the side lines, but. I have to think it through when I get back home.

(Unrelated: I realize I totally feel like a senpai to Rebecca and Jaime, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs actually right. Right?)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

yea i wouldn't feel like that you just feel like that cuz they are also cosplayers at the same time

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Also that I'm kinda the default shooter for the majority of BNE.

But yeah.

I'm just a senpai at heart.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

If gen doesn't make the leg armor out of worbla, I'm gonna say it now, she's screwed

Cause that shit takes a beating after walking and crouching all day

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Did you tell her to?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

Yeee

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

yup, vent again.

maybe I should unmute that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

Me and Ginny were doing a learn lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

Vent has been cured of the edgy nature it was born with.

Civil war meme:
Ginny: Foam
Georgia: Worbla
Civil War

~~also that neck piece is comfortable???~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

wow armor sounds terrible

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

are you guys nah on horse shoot?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

i dont know

we didn't talk about it

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

hasn't been brought up properly before today I thought. The RNJR part.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

i dont see the point in commiting until shes got got nailed down

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

~~it's that guy who was "talking" to us outside cosplay repair <@!228287793099440128> <@!245270932602486784>~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

oo thats the guy who through the blanket on justin

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

Oooo hmmm yeah didn't like him

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

yea he was super creappy

**Dave** - *2018-06-20*

Yep

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-20*

VIVA LA FOAM

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

~~Worbla makes for more accurate armor that stands out in an image~~

Though if I'm picking a side, I'm going with the ~~hobbits~~ 3d printing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-20*

Foam is far cheaper, and if you know what your doing looks just as good, and tends to chafe far less

Most crazy armors do not use worbla, but thick foam as a base 
Like halo armor

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

~~so you can feel like yourself~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-20*

Like your true self yes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

Pyrrha leg armor tho, if you kneel, you'll crush that knee piece in regular foam

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

I uh. Think Sarah is live streaming a boudoir shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

O lovely

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

She‚Äôs mostly out of the phone frame, just can see photographer and that Sarah‚Äôs on a bed.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-20*

Animenext films their entire masq and posts it on YouTube every year

Is the horse shoot in the other group a nucklavee shoot?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

ye

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

WOAH

If help is needed photoshopping the horse at all that sounds like fun

I‚Äôve always wanted to do a nagiasu cosplay and I found one today for $5. It even comes with manaka‚Äôs fins. 
Fish leg Manaka here I come

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*



H y p e

I was worried it wouldn‚Äôt fit because it‚Äôs an M and it says it runs small but it‚Äôs actually a perfect fit, could even be a bit smaller. <:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>  my back up plan for this was to cosplay lewd chisaki if it didn‚Äôt fit but manaka is a success

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

When was chisaki lewd?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*



Trying on her elementary uniform as a college student

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Ooooh right.

Chisaki was best girl. But the shipping in that show was an exercise of masochism.

Tldr fuck you PA works.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

But they have nice random slow mo shots <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Might do chisaki in the US because I have a wig that‚Äôd work and I always feel weird cosplaying elementary schoolers

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Nothing actually happened in 26 episodes.

I‚Äôm as salty as the fish people.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

They were oppressed and slept a lot

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Oh wait epilogue was good for Chisaki Tsumugu.

~~Maybe it‚Äôs just the art the wiki chose, but kinda looks the same despite the time skip through puberty.~~





**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

Given time shenanigans I think that‚Äôs the only viable ship

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

True. Was best ship.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

~~her chest is bigger thus she‚Äôs older duh~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

^^^^

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

*~~That and her hair is the only difference, why does the fourteen year old have the body of a 19 year old~~*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-21*

y she got tit at all

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Sinners.

Chisaki was the ‚Äúmature older girl‚Äù trope, but still.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

Literally in that everyone stayed a kid except her <:lenny:395307171539189760>

she was the fanservice that's why they aged her <:rip:369476083248267274>

the show was pretty tho

i always assumed manaka's fins were real.... but..... are they earrings? ü§î 
looking back at the OP they act like earrings and the accessories i got are earring-esque (japan has earrings that clamp around your ear because very few people have pierced ears)

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Well, the *Isupposethere'snobetterword* plot for her aging made sense.

Like, Nagi was the only PA works show I liked. I'd never watch another PA works, or even Nagi again though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

i hear hibike euphomium is decent i've been meaning to watch it. they continue with the random slowmo

didn't you like angel beats

they worked with key on that

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Angel Beats predates PA work's obession with drama series.

I believe, when did Hanasaku Iroha come out?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

2011-2013

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

AB was in the middle of that, so the theory half stands.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

wait they didn't do hibike. who did that then. hm.

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Kyoto.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

OH duh yeah

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

It has all of Kyoto's things, 
> cute girls
> no men
> Yuri undertones
> high school
> only doing cute things
> everyone plays an instrument

~~throwback to when Kyoto animation did things that weren't crap~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

oo does someone play flute i could do that

gotem



that'd be a cool thursday cosplay. i could play flute in line for badges assuming they don't kick me out

i also have to do a kotomi clannad cosplay with my violin

can just reuse fuko's outfit

swap the patch

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Mawisa.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

*i need*

it's like air to me

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Given you had access to your closet at home.

How many days could you wear a school uniform in a row, without rewearing an outfit and without doing laundry?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

want me to check

only unique school uniforms that are official to a show?

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Sure.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

1.) Boku no Hero Academia (either Tsuyu or Ochako)
2.) Little Witch Academia (Akko)
3.) MouTele (Ayako)
4.) Magus Bride (Chise)
5.) Clannad (fuko)
6.) Brother's Conflict (Emi)
7.) Noragami (Hiyori)
8.) Evangelion (Mari) (I wanna get the regular uniform too though my friend and I might do Rei/Asuka)
9.) Lucky Star (Miyuki)
10.) Dangan Ronpa (Sonia)
11.) Fate/Stay night (Saber)
12.) Shakugan no Shana (Shana)
13.) Nagi no Asukara
14.?) Wolf Children (Yuki) (If that counts as a uniform?)

OH 15.) Beyond the Boundary (mirai)

so 2 weeks

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

Yeah. That's a thing.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-21*

I've noticed that as well, ~~is passed puberty but boobies get bigger anyways if they become a full adult~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

it's how anime girls age

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-21*

Hinata is a prime example

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

hinata's hair got longer too owo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-21*

COINCIDENCE?!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-21*

they have really nice violet evergarden costumes for sale but they're $160 used so nah

**Bill** - *2018-06-21*

violet got a cool as heck outfit, but 160.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

Do we know this person oops I feel bad I‚Äôve been ignoring their messages but I didn‚Äôt realize they existed until right now



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

who are the only ones going to RTX here.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

i saw it in georgia's story but maybe it was just an advertisement

bunny suits suck to make

but it was fun when meg worked at a sewing supply store and when i bought boning online she'd write notes and put them in the package

it kind of scared me the first time i thought meg was trapped in a sewing supply store

bunny voltron cosplay when

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-22*

Oh no üò± poor meg

I'd pay to see bunny pidge lmao

Something about that just doesn't sit right

**Bill** - *2018-06-22*

Jess rn: üëÄ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

? y tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

it'd be weirdest for the only girl in the entire group to wear a bunny outfit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

i feel like pidge would be the most out of place in a bunny suit XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*





**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-22*

thats beautiful

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-22*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

kaltenecker too

Hi welcome to lazy town



My Mirai wig needs more layers and it‚Äôs too pink but maybe that can be hidden with styling

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-22*

Not that pinkk

It's pretty close

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

might be the lighting, this is more suited for a luka wig and looks much pinker in light. if i had some talcum powder that would take care of the color problem ü§î

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-22*

Ohhh that pink yee, ehh that's not sooo bad

Just a little desaturation needed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-22*

moves down the desaturation of life <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-22*

Oh God, if you had control of the saturation of life everything would be blobs of cmyk and rgb

That's awesome thought looks like you were super busy with it

Was it expensive?

It was free! One of the cosplay events we attended before had a coupon for 1 free day (10.5 hours) at one of three studios <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> otherwise it would‚Äôve cost around $40 because Sunday. It would only be around $25 for a full day, we‚Äôll probably go again and just do an hour or two in the evening when it‚Äôs not so crowded. The morning was pretty popular and everyone took turns in the different areas

**Bill** - *2018-06-24*

40 isn't even that much.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-24*

I did pay $5 for really bad batteries that died in under an hour because I forgot to pack extras and didn‚Äôt think the ones they sold would suck so much <:lenny:395307171539189760> but for the experience it‚Äôs not bad at all

Ye especially for that long. Free lockers too which was really nice.

**Bill** - *2018-06-24*

That'd be great if you could get it here.

~~just now realizes Mawisa took a picture of handcuffs and cat ears~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-24*

Also they played really good music. The kyoukai no Kanata theme played when I dressed as Mirai and they played Problem Children music

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

Was gonna post this on Instagram in a few days
What am I, a maid? Pssh



New idea we open a cosplay studio and get rich
Anime expo does it. They put a school and a bedroom in their dealers hall for cosplayers

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-24*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§

I'mma check em out in a moment, I'm kinda hype for this shoot cuz all the previews look great

**Bill** - *2018-06-24*

~~get ready to be disappointed~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

What ooo like alot of em! Good shit üëå üëå

**Bill** - *2018-06-24*

I expect more.

Especially since Georgia's ~~been woo'd by the sword~~ going to play Nier and maybeh be A2.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

I'd love to make the sword but wood workkkkk

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-24*

>w>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

Guess I could technically do it with foam but it's so long

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-24*

Next paycheck should be nicu so I'll probably get it then

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

Maybe if I do beastlord

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-24*

Yeah pink insulation foam is usually what people use

Justin made a big sword like that once

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

yeahh kinda wanna check it out

~~but also kinda wanna make rens dagger first~~

You better beat neir before cosplaying it young lady <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Or at least play it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-06-24*

because you know, Jess has played lots of League.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-24*

OFC i wouldnt cosplay without seeing what the origins of said cosplay were first duh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-24*

I mean I've played it before

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

You don't haaaave to but Nier is too good to pass up

**Bill** - *2018-06-24*

it is.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-24*

Yo I'm so Photoshopping that one picture with he hacking particles

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-24*

Since Marisa isn't in that one <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Why not actually? Cuz not caught up on rwby?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

marisa why do you hide from rwby

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-25*

Wot
Wot I miss

Is that the hidden aurii chat for the Cool Kids

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

We started it to post RWBY spoilers.

Been dead mostly.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-25*

I‚Äôm caught up on rwby

Invite me I can meme it up <:lenny:395307171539189760>

If Georgia yeets strong enough I will be transported across space and time

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

I‚Äôll add you in the morning then.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

ill begin collecting my yeet energy then

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-25*

Biru needs time to erase the lewd and cleanse the chat

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

üòè

~~oops~~ Well there is that Pyrrha Daki....

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-25*

There it is. Georgia‚Äôs next cosplay. 
Rip arm holes and a head hole in the daki

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*



These are all apparently RWBYs from New Jersey

And I only vaguely know the Yang

~~how does someone escape my mad networking skills~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-25*

capture them immediately

o i've seen the weiss before, she cosplays watamote and was in that big sailor waitress group

the others must be assimilated

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

So, to minimize my chance of death at RTX, I'm gonna swap out jeans for jean shorts at RTX

so I ordered some orange socks to match Jaune's orange arm guard things



These are some bright as orange socks

And I'm wondering if it's just a too overwhelming orange, or if the idea of the socks is just stupid to begin with

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

yea thats a good idea

na i like the socks

the match his arm bandies? like same shade?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

They're like pretty close to his canon orange arm guards ~~I just don't wanna be a living traffic cone if they look ugly~~

Yeee they match

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

na it good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*



They're a little brighter

But also I'm doing a genderbend so I have a flexible range

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

NA YOU GOOD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

THANK JESS

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

Nah, that‚Äôs awesome.

Do it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Yeeee it'd keep me cooler AND it separates my fem jaune design from reg jaune

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

Ye, there's a lot of value in making it your own design. Jaune is pretty basic, so spicing it up makes it yours. Plus, adds a bit of femininity to really nail the genderbend feel.

I didn't hit send before whoops

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Yeah and it's stil "jaune"

Its not out of character for jaune to have knee highs

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

Yup. Gotta take a couple liberties, especially with Jaune.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

his outfit is so gender neutral you need to mix it up a bit to get the real genderbend feel.

Jake is preaching again and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do something stupid‚Äù.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

Oh so

Ethan and Casey went to six flags and a ride they we're on broke down for 7 hours üò±

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

That sucks

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

~~i saw that~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

Lol

I initially felt that way

But then I remembered casey and some rando were there too and had to suffer

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

That was Casey‚Äôs brother I believe.

In Casey‚Äôs story.

~~I knew I saw a Ha~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

ah that'd make sense

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

~~it‚Äôs what I was going to say too tho~~

Tom and Jess do need a couple name, if only for cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

i thought it was "Actually Married"

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Need a catchier one?

like something smooth enough you could Hashtag it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

Wasn‚Äôt it Canon

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Not obvious enough it's about them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Yeah I guess that's kinda funny that their ship name is actually married

Whoozikun is pretty cool

Though I'm a big fan of smashing names together so I may be biased

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

neeeeever would have guessed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

WHOOZIKUN SOUNDS AWESOME THO lets be real

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

It's like one too many syllables but yes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

tomica

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Three syllables isn't a loooot

Ooooo that sounds like a precious metal

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

it is most precious

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Or Tom as girl.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

RIP

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Update, I was thinking of Formica and that's a type of granite

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

like, Angelica, Tomica.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

formica's actually a brand of laminate which is plastic, while granite is stone

both are used for countertop tho

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

kamistry posted basically his dick again!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Damn

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

See image in NSFW.

All things that breath must appreciate his abs.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

You met him when he was cosplaying 9s???

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

ye.

Last CCE.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I don't imagine 9s as shredded

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

yeee nah hed make a better eve

but he said he really likes 9s and i cant blame him

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I'd take them abs tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

üå∂

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

yeeee.

We gotta run a nier shoot for CCE. Or the least, attempt to get last years group together again.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

OH so my friend is taking me to her gym tomorrow and if I like it I might get a membership too so we can go together regularly

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Nora gains.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

DO IT BILL

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I CAN GO WITHOUT BEING A POSER NOW

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Oh, the *Nier shoot*, okay, I thought you meant the gym.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

YE Nier

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

~~If you do A2 you're still a poser until you find her in game~~

oh wait, did you enjoy the sand surfing?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

How far in is she

I DID

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

~~ye i think she just glazed over the gym part~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Cause I will never get over that being a fantastic game mechanic, *despite the fact 2B is doing that in heels*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

O no I support the gym too

I just saw Nier and I was like OWO

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Which friend tho Jess, don't Gabi and Jenn live a distance away?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I'd be more hype for gym if Jess was my buddy üòèüòèüòèüòè

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

you work out more than the rest of us so...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

its Gabby, she lives kinda far but she crosses past rockaway on the way to and from work in morristown

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

yeee, okay. Makes sense.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

I work out 3 times a week

just at home so its not that good of a workout

with a partner/at a gym id workout more often and more intensly

~~georgia come be my gym buddy~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

*Nora* intensely?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

nora can bench like 8 times her weight bro

so no

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Did you mean to say: "Goals?"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

no lmao

im not trying to gete swole

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Georgia and Hal on the same machine next to each other, Georgia lifting 4 times Hal's weights
Tom doing yoga with free weights cause why not
Dave saying double it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

YES

omg

i cant lift for shit but yea

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

heh.

Jess goes up behind some norm lifting.

Watches him do two reps.

walks out of frame.

comes back with hammer.

lifts hammer like it's nothing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

i can lift the hammer!

~~not the weights though~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Tom doing push ups with Jess on his back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

cuteeeee omg

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Georgia doing a slow cool down walk, Hal panting along on the treadmill next to her.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

lmao you severely overestimate us

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

~~do you really think I expect a photoshoot in a gym to happen?~~

or a video, as this may be.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

idk man you get some wild ideas

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

~~yes?~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

We'd need a gym. Those have normies.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Or a home gymmm

Hotel gyms too

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Jess can't yell at a random people to exercise harder in an empty gym.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

thats what dave is for

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Dave is *every* extra?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

ü§î

we can recruit a few more

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

look at all of that... Ren.

hotel gyms would lack weight equipment.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Nooo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-26*

Lmao wtfff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

https://www.kalahariresorts.com/pennsylvania/things-to-do/pamper-yourself/fitness-and-training/

kalahari has weights

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

okay, Kalahari is different ye.

I was thinking normal hotel.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Kirsten asked me if she can invite other friends to the BNE event

I said if she needs a +1 just let me know and I'll "okay" it

Anyone else I said for her to send me their names and I'll see what BNE says

It's a conservative answer just in case

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Yeah, though I hate to feel like Sarah.

But Snow shot that in the foot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

The difference is that BNE is a hangout first

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Though, the event isn‚Äôt BNE. BNE can be conservative, the event doesn‚Äôt really need to be.

Unless someone tries to invite Mist/Jake.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I mean just to be safe I figured she just send me the names first

There's people we would probably just prefer not to see possibly

For the same reason we took away invite privileges to the discord

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

We just don‚Äôt need accidental drama. That‚Äôs more an issue with the server tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Yeah

She was just asking about it cause she wanted to invite Zach? I think his name was

Male ladybug

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

Zach was it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-28*

Cosplay at Jess‚Äôs work lets do it

I have the double sided trident I‚Äôd just have to stick a pink gem on it. And I have the horns and the cape

100 likes isnt famous üòÆ

its ok cuz 707 is todays posting plan which means ill get like 60 cuz no tit

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Between Zenkai Team RWBY, Schnee Shoot, and Grey Towers Weiss, I think I have enough Weiss pics to last me a while üòÇ

Stocking up on dem pics before school hits yeeeet

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I've got some bad news for your color palette though.

A2 is a white and black shtick.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Yeah the white will be just like Weiss but I think the black will break it up

Not to mention, buying an A2 outfit would be that stretch latex shit which reflects light

But using the stretch suede should absorb it more

Making the black more black

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Ye, you making it right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

I think so

Someone else I saw their progress and really liked it



That's a black stretch suede more likely than not

And as much as A2 has the _sexy midriff_ id probably cut a little lower

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

going to make the torso separate from the top, like in canon?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Yup

And if swimsuit Nier is happening for CCE and I hop in on that, I would probably do a bikini top and then black swimsuit shorts

Not board shorts tho, shorter than those

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Hot pants, basically.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

And maybe I can get the black of the legs on a pair of tights?

Or maybe a one piece bathing suit Idk

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Pretty sure the black on her legs is tattered leggings.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Yeah

Probably

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I thought I had artbook scans...

hmm.

nah.

A2's base is still skin tone though, she just has the lines to make it look like plates placed on her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Yeah

Which I'd wanna do

Ideally, for swimsuit A2, id wanna get a swimsuit like this



Or



And have the full body dance tights on, with the plate lines painted on the tights

(So I can still swim and not worry about make up coming off

And have the plate lines showing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

:Oc

No open sides tho

I mean I guess that is sorta ambitious

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

You could edit it

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

lol, gotta have some midriff apparently.

just not *sex* midriff.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

ITS A SWIMSUIT it different

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Or a tankini with hot pants and add her details on the bottom

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

The only problem is that tights have a seam up the middle

So id wanna hide that

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

You could still do the destroyed leggings part of the main outfit for the swimsuit right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Be careful with that the floors in the water park are grippy cement they tear tights apart

The same floors are in all the pools and hot tubs

Basically whatever you wear will be one time use

Unless it's really durable like if you put the shoe bottom thingy in like you have for ladybug

But regualt tights or leggings are gonna get destroyed

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

cut the feet off maybeh?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Could

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Get some sexy water shoes? üòÇ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

<:rip:369476083248267274>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-28*

oof

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

snrk.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Honestly a suit like the one I posted, but cut the bottom off and trim to mach hers, put her design on it, then hot pants and your good leggings optional

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I get wanting to do the plate lines though. They really define A2.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Oof swimsuit material is the only thing I haven't fucked with yet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

It's a swimsuit version your allowed to take creative liberty

Gloves would be cool, maybe I should I think about that

I'mma have to step up my 2b

Gotta get Nora done first though

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

what is the lineup plan for you and tom?

Cause I was serious, lets see about getting Nier's together.

* again

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

At least neir and RWBY

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

:3c

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I more mean days, cause I'm guessing RWBY saturday cause shoot.

So Nier friday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

I'll probably chunk mine Nier/Ladybug Friday (which works cause late night swim), Pyrrha Saturday, Yona Sunday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Georgia we should do some swimsuit material ntesting together üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

If we're doing a gathering we need a time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

WE COULD

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

swim Yona or Yona Yona?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

I'm probably going to alter an allready made bathing suits but it would still be good to know what would work and what wouldn't

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Probably Yona Yona

I'll pack a swimsuit tho

It's not that hard to wear a swimsuit under Yonas bathrobe lookin thing

Yaaaas I already have dark brown bottoms for Pyrrha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Yea that's an easy one

I mean honestly swimsuit cosplay can be as easier or as hard as you wanna make it

Unless the thing has a canon swimsuit, it's free game

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Yeah swimsuits is gonna drive me insane tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-28*

üò±

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Cause I'll still want to be recognized

So I'll probably throw in a lot of components of Pyrrha and A2

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Carve a noodle into the shape of Pyrrha's weapons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

Pyrrha is reconized by just her head piece and hair

A red bathing suit would suffice

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Oh no fuck the headpiece if I get a sunburn in that I'll cry

_and I always burn_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

I know you won't do that but a person could do that

Last year the outside pools weren't even open

It is in September

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

True, CCE isn't about stress.

And yup, we didn't go outside much. It was cold.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

I ain't stresssssin, I'm being thorough

REALLY

Interesting it was hot as balls at Rutgers lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

And A2 you'll be with me and probably Tom as 9s? Maybe there's not way you won't be recognized

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Yeah I mean I'm not sweating A2

I have a decent idea of how to do everything

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Pyrrha ain't worth sweating either.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

I ain't sweating y'all

Just figuring out where to procure my boobie holders

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Not yet maybe üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Are u gonna make a suit from scratch?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Heck nah

I'll use half what I already have and half whatever I buy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Me too fam

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

I only have 3 swimsuits and my mom said she would pay for more so :3c

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Nicu ~~im coming too~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

<:rated_lewd:391242351198339093>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

üò±

To buy swimsuits!!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

Swimsuit shopping when üôè

We doing the classic animu swimsuit shopping episode

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Ooooooh I take it back Pyrrha looks naked without the tiara

_if only I owned Nike flip flops instead of Adidas what a fool I am_

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Yup.

Pyrrha must always Tiara.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Just but some plain red ones silly butt

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

ARE WE STILL GETTIN SICK TEMP TATS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Hell ye

I think that's a really good idea

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

That'll be so cute üíï

Ok so Pyrrha needs a red top

And then she done

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

So Nier Friday afternoon?

for a getting everyone together.

like 2, same time as rwby group shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Is there a rwby swimsuit shoot?

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Just rwby regular.

People will be in swimsuits though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Like me!

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Ye, don't stress needing regular cosplay.

Worst probably would be being cold outside.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

That's ok I wore 2b in February outside near the water

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

No shame == warm apparently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

No

I was not warm

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

I'mma say Nier shoot should meet in lobby, if the group is small we can do water park shoot otherwise abort to larger location.

For Nier I actually would love the outside pool area.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Yea but who knows big it'll be open

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

they opened it last year for photos.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Bill you submitting for it now!

?*

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

pretty much.

Well, is this like "Nier group shoot" or do we just put it on blast ourselves to keep it small?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Nah make it THE Nier shoot

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Like 2B^2 part 2?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

The more the merrier

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Yea big shoot

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Omg we're gonna find out who the faker gamer bois are

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Someone comes up to jess like "hey I love your 2B your butt looks amazing" and Jess grabs me and goes "oh yeah, if you've played Nier WHO IS THIS"

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Yes, submitting it now Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

YEEET when you make da event invite me

Because

Facebook Events are half my ability to organize

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

I feel like Adam would be less recognized

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*



the fuck is that?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Well that's weird

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

I don't think CCE staff gives a fuck about those request forms anyway.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

That's odd

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Maybe but it may also get put in the guidebook

I doubt anyone else is making a Nier shoot Friday tbh if we just wanna make a Facebook event and say fuck it

Also side note if I really don't wanna be in cosplay Saturday for the RWBY shoot imma just put my Pyrrha shirt on

Casual JNPR shirts come so handy I tell ya

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Why wouldn't you want to be in cosplay?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

WHOOPS I mean swimsuit

If I don't wanna take group pics in a swimsuit

Cause Idk self conscious or cold or some shit

I'm doubting even bringing full Pyrrha tbh

It doesn't sound like the kind of con for it

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Don't bother.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

That's what I figured lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Yeah, t shirt is a good idea then. Or a Jaune hoodie. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

üòè

Actually by then I'll have my own cause I need one for fem jaune

Can't borrow hals cause he may be sweatin in his

Love dat boi, not sure I wanna share sweat

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Ya'll were stripping a few hours into last years.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

its a cool suit anyway

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

YEAH I wonder how much titty support there is

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

that it a good question

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Dat nice.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

ok so i cant find a high neck white bikini top that look decent anywhere üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Team RWBY is now the most liked picture I've posted.

I give all the credit to Georgia and Leanna being in it.

~~None to Snow~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

O wow it just barely beat shirtless ryan and electromagnetism tho

Juuuust barely

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

I should really sew those black buttons onto Adams sleeve to top off the Cosplay

But first I gotta replace 9s lost choker TwT

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Does anyone else think Chris is much better as Qrow than the idea of him as Jaune or Ren?

I like his Qrow, I think he‚Äôs better suited to the adult characters than the students.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

yo tom i actually found some like suede/velvet thats similar to that fabric you and jess have

i could just bring some of it to bills partay so you dont have to buy a new one

i was thinking the fabric would be good for A2 but it has no stretch

and yeah i dont see chris as qrow either

jaune maybe

ren no

~~tom and jess are the true ren and nora~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Eeeeh. His Qrow is his best cosplay. He likes being Qrow and it makes a world of difference.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

people cosplay what they wanna, but you make a valid point, some cosplays just dont work for some people

like i could never cosplay cinder

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Yeah, it‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt do it, it‚Äôs that he‚Äôs more comfortable being Qrow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

THO PRAISE GEN FOR GETTING HIM A WIG

idk my hopes arent too high for their pyrrha and jaune

they got like a month to build

which is about the same time i built my pyrrha but i also wasnt working a full time job or in school

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

chris's qrow is good

rens a hard character for average to large built men

but people can do what they want ofcourse

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

I was thinking I was gonna use my faux leather for the choker

But idk maybe the material you have is better

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

~~We‚Äôre all friends, we all know we support cosplaying whoever you want we don‚Äôt need to reinforce it~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

ill bring it just in case, worst case scenario you decide yours is better lmao

I KNOW BUT I JUST FEEL BAD

like ethan i can make fun of his ren cause i dont like him

chris is a nice dude tho so i feel like i gotta soften the blow

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

doesn't hurt to reiterate

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

I think he‚Äôs doing these for Gen too, which doesn‚Äôt help. I wanna know what he *wants* to cosplay.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

Mmtay! Thanks üëå üôè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

thats true

im glad her break up with rob didnt ruin renora or snowbirds for her

it was kinda uncanny how rob was a good qrow AND ren

AND roman

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

He was better Qrow than Ren.

Tom is truly best Ren.

No bias, he nails it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

aesthetically idk rob is a pretty good ren

toms got the whole enchilada tho

AND the guns

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

she wants him to do akane x kogami too

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

SOON THE DAGGER

THANKS THO ‚ù§

Rob is a good ren

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Rob is good, just saying he is my headcanon Qrow still.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

oh ye tru

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

His qrow and Roman are super good tho

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

None can touch it.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

Although Rob is a beautiful man so

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

ive never seen his ren in person but in pics its v. good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

rob is a beautiful man

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Roman was really good too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

o wait rob had the guns too i forgot that whoops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

yea rob is good looking

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

Lmao

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

*roman

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

I wonder if everyone was able to pick birth bodies.. what would be the most popular gender after trying both

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

i feel like itd still be sorta even split

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

That‚Äôs a tough one.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

Might be dude heavy just cuz periods suck

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

whoa thats some next level shit

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

And correct, guy becomes girl, guy grabs tit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

yea periods and childbirth

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Anime has taught us well.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

ooooh you got me with the childbirth

i was gonna say periods arent too bad

i dont have many qualms with being a girl

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

~~that depends on who you are thou~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

Yeah some periods are heckin bad ‚ú® 
Im sure it Depends on the person

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

touche

i used to be iron deficient and that would make me really woozy when i got periods

cause ya heckin losing blood boi

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

switch bodies with a man on my whiles im on my period 
"have fun being up all night moaning in pain in fetal position foo"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

my biggest complain is probably getting sexualized or hit on

cause some people are mad weird about doing it

side note, alriiiight one new pyrrha shoe down one to go

these have a bigger heel and also have velcro so the cuffs stop spinning around throughout the course of the day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

YEA thats too

AND YAY

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

i also hate when button up shirts do _the boob thing_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

UGHH YES

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Being a guy is definitely the easier.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

im actually wearing one that doesnt do that today what magic is this but the trade off is its too big in the tummy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

^^^^^

it only gets worse with bigger boobs

i dont even close my flannels anymore

i have an undershirt

its a nice style but dammit sometimes i wanna wear my clothes lol

also idk, culturally men are expected to do stuff and i dont like that pressure

like ASK A GIRL TO MARRY ME? oof pressure

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

NAH you just gotta be like 99% sure the answer is yes

like holy shit what if tom propsed to me and i said no he would have been like WTFFFFFFFFFFFFF

also it would have made 0 sense cuz i was litterally like LETS DO THE THING everyday

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

I woulda been bamboozles

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

"alright ill try again tomorrow"

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Boob thing?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Boob thing?

Ah, I see. Context made sense too, just was driving.

~~I get the in the gut I understand~~

Women do get more options in clothing, particularly dress clothes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

oh yea dat tru

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Guys it‚Äôs a suit, just removing pieces as needed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

ive feel for my coworker when its like really hot out and if the ac isnt working cuz ill wear a skirt

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm jealous of the option (without Georgia Shorts ‚Ñ¢ I dunno how you could wear a skirt) but it‚Äôs definitely a perk to some people.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

longer skirts i have no problem not wearing shorts under

~~wait why does georgia get the crdeit for that?~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

cause without them i think id have more panty shots

this ho doesnt close her legs for pics WHOOPS

Exhibit A



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

She‚Äôs just the one who makes a point of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing shorts‚Äù.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Earliest source I know of for it is Misaka Mikoto in To Aru.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

Fourth of July photoshoot, lets go.

Put all that american apparel to work.

<@!245270932602486784> If Kirsten is going to do the PJ party saturday she's not saying overnight saturday, so she'd want you to help. (I think she'd want help either way, but.)

she's going to message you herself.

well, help, "take the reins".

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

I'd do it lmao

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Well you can tell her. Didn‚Äôt know if you‚Äôd rather be responsibility free.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Does she want me to take it over or actually cohost?

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

She said she‚Äôd message you. I think take it over, I think she‚Äôs leaving early Saturday.

Not late enough for pj party.

But then again, she won‚Äôt be there for it?

Wasn‚Äôt that the reason to start it?

I‚Äôm not sure.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

~~jk I'm gay for JNPR hahaaaaaa~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

yeah true

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Fair.

I had looked earlier tho, actually haven‚Äôt shoot Pyrrha solo since you had the original pieces. Like, all of them. Corset, wig, leg armor...

See what you get from Ben tho, time for other ideas is more valuable I‚Äôd say.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

ben today was mostly a test run for the shoes

which btw are 100 times better and im never going back, even if the original ones are more canonical

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

good good üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

so now begins the journey of pyrrha 3.0, the final pyrrha

which is basically just perfecting the leg armor and then im 100% happy

curse these perfectionist tendencies

oh yeah bill ben brought a +1 btw

her name is ebony and shes really nice

so we had like two photographers going at once, it was really interesting

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

wezrez best of the West and the east and the waterfront who shimmers like a breaching dolphin and smiles like a dentist commercial

It‚Äôs still a wip

A good dentist commercial. The after version of a dentist commercial.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

Oof ben sent me preview pics from the shoot yesterday

Idk which to post





**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Ooo neeto!

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Yo hate how good those look. üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Howed he get that angle on that ground one with rei?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

he stood on tippy toes and lifted the camera above his head

which i learned cameras are heavy so

im glad i didnt know that beforehand or i wouldve thought he would drop the camera on mah face

like shooting at anext, bills camera was kinda heavy

ben had a mammoth lens on his though and idk that camera was THICC

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

OOF

Still that's cool üëå üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

ye and having reiley there was awesome too

i dont like shooting alone orz

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Yeah I was just saying that to Jess last night how I'm glad reiley went with you

Cuz I'd want a Friend there as well

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

yeah reiley never has plans ever so if i go "hey come with me" theyre just like "ok"

i mean im not worried about being creeped on, ive shot with ben a few times

i just hate shooting alone as a rule of thumb lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

You talking about different reasons for being alone at shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

OH PRINCESS VIRGO FOUND ME TOO

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

You still shoot alone for some of it tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

like solo shots?

yeah i mean pyrrha and weiss can only work so many ways

and my solo shots always do better on insta

and its easier to capture the details of the cosplay

but also its just kinda lonely to shoot solo

thats less prominent with you bill because were friends first so i can derp around with you lol

but with claire or ben, the other peeps i usually shoot with, its a little more formal

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Well you hung out with Ben after right?

Maybe you‚Äôre getting a little more informal?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

ye i invited him and his apprentice to chilis

she was really nice

she talked to rei a lot

i think thats cause she also gay, tryna find more gays

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Rei can definitely help with that lol.

What‚Äôs Bens day job? He isn‚Äôt a full time photographer is he?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

he was doing a lot of stuff for his dads construction company last i heard

now hes working for a car show company, taking photos of cars, which is like his dream job

he wants to start up some side projects of doing his own outside photography (he shot for a wedding last month) but that hasnt really taken off

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

So is a full time photographer, pretty much. Makes me feel better, that down shot is *good shit*.

I don‚Äôt know how he kept his own shadow from showing up.

Maybe with flashes?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

oh well that was just the way the sun was probably

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Did he use flash?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

we were in a courtyard

nah no flash

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

There's def some shopping on those pics those

With the shadows

Which is fine

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

he shopped his feet out of the pyrrha/weiss one LOL

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Just don't go trying to compare yourself to shopping billiam

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Ye, particularly the colored shadow on the edges.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Unless you wanna pic up shopping but

That's time consuming

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

yeah hes hardcore with photoshop

i watched him edit a little bit on call once

it was nuts

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Speaking of which! I gotta shop that one 9s piccc aggggg

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Ye not what I‚Äôm comparing on. The base shot is a *hard* pose.

Cause shadows and height. I‚Äôm jealous of that.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

Oh yeah for that lmao

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

We‚Äôve tried it.

It bombed hard for ota JNPR.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

yeahhhh

~~i suggested the pose oops~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

We made it work by shooting against the wall, but the down stuff didn‚Äôt work.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

~~sometimes edgy poses come out so good~~

yeah

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

It‚Äôs an awesome photo, I just haven‚Äôt figured out how to *do it*.

Man, sometimes I wish I could spend all my time doing photography. Like, as my work work.

I could never deal with the business side of it, (ie getting any) and photographer definitely doesn‚Äôt pay like my field.

But I wish I had the time to dive and improve more.

~~Georgia move closer so I have a on call model~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

his "apprentice" person was really cool too

she had a lot to say about the photography side

she said that doing a cosplay shoot seems really up her alley, cause when she shot with actual models they would be rude and sassy, or legtimately would be like "what do i do"

which i was surprised by

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Indellient added a policy where after 3 years you can take a 3 month unpaid sabbatical. If I‚Äôm still with indellient then, I‚Äôd take it to do photos the whole time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

conveniently take it during summer and boom on call model

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Models are apparently bitches. I‚Äôve heard it before.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

assuming im not interning for like the 10th time

REALLY

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Unless you already in NASA.

~~join meme office~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

i got grad school boiiii

i cant join nasa for permanent until thats squared away

man i wanna do skits like the jesses do

that looks so fun

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-30*

Ah yes princess vigro followed me also

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

_where did they come from_

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Multiple internships at NASA kid. It happens.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-30*

From the virgoland

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

o well ya

and theres stem meme team as back up üòô

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-30*

*where did they go*

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

For all you know, NASA will like you enough to sponsor grad school at a local to them university.

You work part time at nasa and get your degree while you do.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

theres no where local to maryland thats huge in astrophysics that i know of ü§î

the supreme goal would be like, princeton

but thats for really smart people ~~but also that means i could shoot there so much easier wowee~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

I know someone who was student government president there.

Made papers during his term for his work.

I can hit him up to help you out. üòé

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

(/-w-)/ connections

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

But a lot of places will do that if you impress them as an intern.

~~Then you‚Äôll move to Maryland and we‚Äôll never see you again~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

/invents a teleporter

"ma'am what inspired you" "i missed my friends and still wanted to do cosplay shoots in princeton so i made a teleporter :D"

whats the pyrrha and weiss ship name?

im seeing "white gold" but idk if thats it

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Check the r/RWBY chart.

It‚Äôs linked in the side bar.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

ah yeah north pole and schneekos sound way more familiar

ben just posted about charging to do shoots, im glad hes putting more elbow grease into building a clientbase

i still wonder if he should be charging me for the shoots weve and is just too afraid to ask thoü§î

i always thought the same with you bill but now i get that photos and hanging out tend to go hand in hand for us, at least in situations like grey towers

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

Future shoots from him offer, past shoots are already done. You can‚Äôt backcharge people.

If I had to choose, I‚Äôd rather be your friend and never shoot you again rather than the opposite yes. Plus I have no want for money for shooting. My time is the most valuable thing to me, and time from you is similarly so.

Time spent together, both for the shoot and when we get together elsewhere, is all I‚Äôd want.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-01*

found a super adorable weiss today who didn't know how to pose (i think this is her first cosplay) so cardcaptor sakura had to show her how it's done

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-02*

Ooof

**Bill** - *2018-07-02*



I‚Äôm glad she realized it, and more importantly understands it‚Äôs okay not to finish it. It‚Äôs not worth trying to crunch to the last minute.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-02*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-02*

I‚Äôm too awake to sleep but too tired to do anything else this is awful

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-04*



Mmmmmmmmm

New goals

**Bill** - *2018-07-04*

Swim suit first ay.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-04*

Mmmmmm nicuuu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-04*

Is that a bodysuit that's been painted

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-04*

Looks like they did the homestuck arm sock thing but put gloves over it

costumes have been tried on (except for alibaba because i don't want to unravel the giant midriff piece now and i'm still not sure if i want to cosplay him or stick with morg and give the costume to a third person for our cosplay group)

maki is really comfortable and there's a really nifty bit of fabric that hides the buttons on the front i'm gonna learn to sew and steal for future costumes. i'm probably gonna do a maki day at a future con where i just cosplay different versions of her all day.

i still don't understand how sizing works because miku's small skirt and mephisto's large pants both fit the same (wearable but tight). i need to find out what they did to mephisto's collar to make it stick up like it does because it's awesome and no amount of pelon and stiffening spray achieved that effect with nowi's collar. 

sheryl and remilia's zippers are a little finicky but they can be replaced if it becomes a big problem. i was only stuck in remilia for like 10 minutes so it's probably fine.

mephisto's parts will also provide a nice base for Ray. it'll be a lot easier to make a pattern for all the under-tux pieces.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-04*

OHHHHHH  yooo that's nice

I need this site in america

Oof

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-04*

YEAH they need this site in the US.
it'd be also cool if there was a cosplay-specific dry cleaners.

they have so many costumes that i spent like $200 making and they're selling them for $10-20
i'm like <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-04*

SO JELLLLY

I'd spend all the muney

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-04*

Yea I'd spend mad cash üí∞except not really apparently

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-04*

i'm curious how they price stuff because some things are like, $2
and other things are $90 like this
http://www.mitubado.com/56_130494.html

they have some love live outfits for $20 that i know you can buy new for $15 on aliexpress so their pricing is a mystery

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-04*

Loooolll that's should not be $90

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-04*

Hindsight being 20/20 it was nuts

I was in high school tho so I had nothing but free time

Usually I was Nepeta or Terezi

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-04*

i memorized so many fish puns for feferi

**Bill** - *2018-07-04*

Good picture, saw that one before on the tumblers.

The one from before with you being sexy troll.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-04*

Oh no that's not troll Jesus but that's one of his descendants

There's like three "iterations" of trolls but they're all in different timelines essentially

Making the trolls all the same troll

But also descendants

**Bill** - *2018-07-04*

,...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-04*

So troll Jesus was related to red sweater who was related to karkat who I ALSO cosplayed.

**Bill** - *2018-07-04*

Don‚Äôt shoot the messenger.

Y‚Äôall know I‚Äôm a a sucker for personality theory.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-04*

~~you can't just blame stuff in your sign~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-04*

Whose blaming anything, I‚Äôll own up to it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-04*

the leo zodiac requires at least (1) JNPR shoot a month to function

dont blame me, blame the stars

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-04*

üôè

**Bill** - *2018-07-04*

You right, guess it just is the way it is.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-04*

tom what foam were you using? tnt cosplay, any particular type?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-04*

tnt eva foam, nothing in paricular

its just nice clean foam

not that badly priced either, just need to wait the week an a half shipping time

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-04*

ye i took a look, i think its cheaper per square inch than the eva foam i used to order

not sure tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-04*

ooo maybe!
its (mainly) what the poppy hammer is made out of too, since dave ordered it first

YO THEY HAVE EVA DOWELS

Shit i wish i saw that before thats dope

i only bought the 38

not the 50 but i've heard that high density is super nice

i just ordered 1 of every size too, just to have it

ALOT of weapon making videos from pros seem to use high density, but 38 is just a bit softer, depends what you are making i suppose

guns is prob good to use high density or things with small parts

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*



HA!

Confirmed it‚Äôs a theoretical double date scenario. *The ship can sail Captain*

You just get your cultists to fight Georgia for you. Don‚Äôt worry, she can spawn RWBY cosplayers for defense.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

"If you're insecure about your butt cheeks hanging out, this is not for you"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

since apparently not even he is on my side

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I‚Äôm out getting lunch. And why wouldn‚Äôt he be on your side?

~~Also why is he playing Tekken what~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

he went home

got bored of being alone so he took a half day

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Big mood

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

hmmm wait if i get a high hip suit then im going to have a visable  tan line ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Nakie tanning?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

üòÆ how do that? i mostly tan in publis like when im swiming and stuff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Like a private tanning place!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

ooooo that spence

unless get black card for planet fitness but meh idk

will weigh pros and cons of high hip bathing suit later

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Wouldn‚Äôt you just need to tan in that bathing suit?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

yea but i dont wanna wear that suit all summer D:

the stuggle is real

ill just wear spf 100 and re apply it every 2 hours and get no tan at all üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Lather on sunscreen to stay pale lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

YE

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I can only think of two people here... One, 2017 me was right, two... Poor Leanna.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

WHAT WHO?

what does 2017 you know that i do not?

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I said way back when Erik had a crush it was Leanna. This would be going the other way, but it's believable.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

The other... well, Ethan and Casey are at it again, so... I guess the disaster isn't happening.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

oooohhhh spiccycycyccyy

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*casually asks if Erik is up to anything this weekend*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

HMMMMMMM

ü§î ü§î ü§î ü§î ü§î

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

he in her profile pic oooooooo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

Ya know

i think thats semi likely

MAYBE THATS WHY LEANNA HUNG OUT WITH ETHAN

just put up with him

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

!!!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

for the Eric booty

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*He cosplays Blake*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

*shit*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

OMG tru

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

i think its actually likely

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*As we know from Georgia, cosplayers cannot date someone who does not cosplay their ship partner*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

hmmmm

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

and tie lol rip

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

~~Doesn't stop Georgia and Hal~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

exactly

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

My only reservation is the 'meeting her friends' thing. If we're assuming her other core friends are cosplayers, he's likely met them...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

~~that's why I hung out with Ethan~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

to get to erik?

jk jk

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

Yes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

i dont blame you

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

I wanted a big spoon for once

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

yaaaaaaas

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

They're really hard to find

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

im asuming you meant you hung out with ethan to hang out with georgia

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

LMAO

NO ERIC FAM

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

yea, I mean, say your cute thing too bud.

*But I reeally want to know who Leanna asked outtttt*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-05*

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Also the only male 9S.

Unless Kamistry comes outta the woodwork.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

You could get hate kisses :V

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

~~More like hate choking~~

*I'm not kink shaming, it's just what happened last year!*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

>->

I'm patterning out A2's tattoos in the car

This is gonna be INTERESTING

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

Hard mode

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

I think I got a way to do it

I'm just gonna have to wear essentially a full body pair of tights

And have someone with a really steady hand paint them on

Or I'll sucker a sister into wearing them while I do it lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

Yea that's what I was thinking

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

I'm just trying to pattern out the lines for stuff now

~~do y'all got any A2 nekkid fanart cause I need to honestly see how the lines continue up her body for a swimsuit~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Nope.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Dats just a nice A2.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

i feel like most nude fanart of a2 has her just with skin so it doesnt help

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

It does, commented that in bobbies.

**Dave** - *2018-07-05*

thought i was going to be emil

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Nah, but bucket robot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Idk for me I just look at the cosplays I already have and the list of cosplays I wanna do and work from there

Red and blonde

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

problem is i dont have alot of female charcters that stand on their own

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

And white.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

One white, soon to be two, yes

Whites a type of blonde I guess?

And that's the struggle ain't it üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Nahhh just

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

OH YOU MEAN LILITH

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

well raven is technically grey

but alot of people do her white i i guess i could to that

but yea lilith is out cuz body paint

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

What else is on your list of what you wanna cosplay?

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*What thing have you gotten into late recently?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

uhh CC, kinda sorta zelda but i feel liek they both need da boi

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Wuts tom doin

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Zelda... ugh, you right, but I wish she was standalone.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

ren, 9s.adam and leo i think?

but not on sunday i don think

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Zelda you can do solo for sure

There's a lot of Zelda lovers out there

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

nah, not swimsuit

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

I guess it depends on which outfit-theme you use to inspire you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

honestly it doesnt feel right since i nver even finished botw

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

The head piece from a few of the games would be recognizable with the ears.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

The ears and hair are pretty trademark tho

Touch√©

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Oh right yeah, BOTW wouldn‚Äôt be recognizable.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

You'd wanna cosplay any other RWBY girls?

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Unless you drew on MEGA eyebrows.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

nah not swimsuit at least

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

~~suffer as Pyrrha~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

it wouldnt be suffereing if it was swimsuit silly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

O rly I thought Blake would be right up your alley tbh

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I didn‚Äôt say swimsuit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

With that KAWAII ASS BOW

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Oooh, that would be neat for Jess.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

yea blake was my og fav

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*Youd have to bat Leanna off with a stick*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

but im not really keen on 2 cosplays from same series in one weekend

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Me, cosplays RWBY three days straight: I feel that

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

But Blake‚Äôs v4 outfit is just asking for swimsuit cosplay.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

You wanna be seven? üòÇ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

im too picky üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

That top is perfect for a bikini.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

nah i aint even attempting that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

What other media you like? Any videogames or animus in particular?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i havent gotten into anything lately really

liek theres things i like but no female characters i wanna cosplay

ill figure out something

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Yo that's also a mood

That's part of why I haven't watched Voltron I think üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ooooo yea like that!

like i like voltron but i wanna cosplayficken lotor the most XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Yeee

Like Pidge sounds cool but I don't like the outfit

And ~~Afina~~ Allura has a nice outfit but ehhh idk not for me

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ye me neither, like i love pdge but

ye and then the rest are boys RIP

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

R I P

and the fandom is kinda immature in some senses with their... I don't even know how to explain it other than it reminds me of Homestuck

Like at Zenkai a lot of the Voltron peeps were 14 y/os there that wanted the "hot yaois"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

NICE

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

And then there's normal people like you and Gen who watch lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-06*

yeah

they are all just young mainly

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

It's a fad fandom.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

all fandoms are fads to an extent

if they keep making seasons itll stick

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-06*

i get what you mean though with the fandom feels immature

you almost feel to old for it

but only cuz of the fandom

if you had your own group of older peeps it wouldnt be as bad

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Jess let's just get shutter shades and wizard beards and be hot party wizards in bikinis

That's an idea

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

OH YEA i forgot about tahjt

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Could do either group back there, JNPR or Nier.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Mm.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

that would be my only temptation to bring full cospalys

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

You could still do swimsuits back there, it's water lol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

A thought: color coordinated towels for JNPR?



**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

They have towel service there.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

These peoples did it and it looks cute

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Well Tom has a pink one for towel Ren

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

~~its more for aesthetic than purpose~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

But then do I take Tom's pink towel and he gets a green one? üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

And it's up to y'all Jess

I'd get red for sure, maybe put a P on it maybe not

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

I mean if tom has the pink towel do you also have pink?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

I don't know üòÆüòÆüòÆ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Jackass?

I mean that's not gonna happen but

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

so like, can we do stereotypical 'sexy swimsuit' poses for Nier, but with üòê faces cause emotions are prohibited?

So it's like super awkward?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

_red dress girl?_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-06*

I'm down fam <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Just picture it though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

*takes off flip flop* am I sexy now

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Like, *look at these abs* pose (so Kamistry breathing), but you're just like üòë

Making it super awkward, looking right into the camera.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Oh yeah I guess you need pose lists rather than shipping shots

Cause this is a fandom that's actually not massively overwhelming to shoot

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I mean, I don't have one of those yet. I'm making a normal call list.

Namely to have a medium of order to the ship calls.

~~None of which have cool names~~

I was thinking we might need some themed shots tho.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

A2 and 2B

Oh nvm

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Gotcha.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

I mean I wouldn't go to crazy I doubt alot of these are gonna show up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

~~do you mean electromagnetism~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

That's basically it.

Or rather, that is it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Oh boy now to finish route C and figure out how to pose with tom and Jess yeehaw

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

You finished B?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

I feel like, if emotions weren't prohibited, 2B and A2 got some sexual tension

That, I also have to finish that

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Start with that.

*And make sure you are at a minimum live chatting C*

It's kinda just to have in case, The ships are the ones that *should* happen no matter what if the characters are present, the crack ships can get requested.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

2b and a2 don't really interact that much thou?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Oh no don't say that üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

They have one important interaction for sure.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-06*

It's more a2 and 9s

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

OH NO THAT SOUNDS WORSE üò≠üò≠üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Yea one lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Obviously Glory to Mankind.

That's a face of like "fuck yeah" not anger

üò° that's anger

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i thought it was like "hmpf!" sassy anger

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Mmmm touch√©

There's no sigh emoji and that is the truest travesty

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-06*

I mean the emoji is named triumph

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

looks sassy angry to me

~~ye~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

~~Tom is Dan's waifu yes~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

wait then how would you say that?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

~~he likes crazy? But Jess is so kind and normal :O~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

just switch the pronouns. She is just waifu trash for him.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

yea idk ü§∑

well anyway

shes a trash waifu

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I MEAAAAAN according to *that one blake cosplayer at colossal east* Jess is *pretty wild...*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

FUCK YOUUUUUUUU

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

***cease these lies***

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

God I wish I knew a blake cosplayer you don't so I could get them to play the part.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

why is @ table-1 sitll a thing but no other tables?

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

they all should be.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i wouldnt believe you anymore

tom and georgia dont have it

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I wouldn't be the one saying it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i wouldn't believe them either

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Table 2 isn't a command now?

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Oh, I had removed that from everyone I thought.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Yeah I thought they all werent

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

lol everyoe sept me

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I removed individual tables from everyone's name, because they weren't accurate anymore.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

SEPT ME

now it gon

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

I mean nevermind the fact that table two was just two people for a while there

A command was almost moot point

Though I guess it's shorter than typing two @s

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

wow lol Chameleonkid posted Yang.

That's like, the third time ever.

*Wow in fucking March instagram, why are you telling me now?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

maybe she just tagged you in it

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

or edited it yeah.

idc. Didn't like her.

Okay is work over now?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

seriously

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I'm pleasantly surprised this did so well.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

WHEEEE

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

like, Renora levels:

Just under Meme level:

Just under solo Georgia:

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

THE GAYS RULE

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

you can just say you have a favorite. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

the public says they rule

i said nothing :X

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

suuuUUUUUuuuure.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

I bought heart shaped sunglasses for Nora cuz I'm extra

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

DAWWWW

where'd you get them, Amazon?

Or were they in the store and just CALLING to you?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Nah Amazon

They're pink to orange gradient I had too

**Dave** - *2018-07-07*

Q
Who needs a spare purple wig?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-07*

What shade of purple and how long is it :3c
Gotta out them deets. Or is this a rhetorical question

**Dave** - *2018-07-07*

EmaxDesign Wigs 28 Inch Cosplay Wig... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Y832TFO?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf

Not used

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-07*

A freshly harvested wig

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

You have 2?

I'm trying to think who I could use it for üòÇ

**Dave** - *2018-07-07*

Only one

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

You not gonna syndra again?

**Dave** - *2018-07-07*

I ordered the Amazon wig as a backup in case the mic costumes did not come in time

**Bill** - *2018-07-07*

<@!351471675843411978> you could probably use hiyori wig to be D.Va.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

I have considered this

**Bill** - *2018-07-07*

Dreamed that. As a side note to a dream about the colossal east rooms being like, kid friendly or something, which Kalahari doesn't even have.

~~I still might call Kalahari anyway~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

They have rooms for kids, lol with jungle themed bunk beds and stuff

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-07*

Yeah they totes do

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-07*

I'm so curious what labinnaks cosplay is for RTX

damn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

Guess you better support her on patreon

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-07-07*

Been working on my "My Hero Academia" cosplay these past few days

S I G H S

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Oh he's a girl too?

BRO like I don't think you work out, I do t think he sews and he's not a blonde girl

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

*only girls have aesthetics?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

No silly

Oh NVM I thought the button said girl on it too

Still tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Spoke to chatterbox, owner wasn't there but the manager there said people have done photos there before (a wedding apparently? I guess? nani the fuck?) so the owner should likely be okay with it. He or his daughter will be in tomorrow morning so I'll talk to them then about maybe shooting Sunday morning there. It will have to be morning too, gotta do it off business hours.  <@!245270932602486784>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

~~can I come too~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

_he aint blonde tho_

YE JESS YOU FREE SUNDAY!

?*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

I think so?

I do t ahve fallout stuff tho, but maybe I could trow together something else time periody?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Georgia has a dress that's old timer she showed me awhile back, could do pre and post war.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

I have a blue and white polkadots dot one that kinda vintage but I could probably order something else

If I had more warning I would have liked to do a vault suit or other fallout outfit

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

15th was going to be for glitter apocalypse, but we never got started on it so now we're filling the slot.

Especially given Georgia busy as fuck.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Ah, I know you originally mentioned end of summer so

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

what, for Chatterbox?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Yea or maybe that's just what I assumed

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

I'll ask when exactly they're closing up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

OH JESS WAIT I have a black and red polka dot dress

We could do like a coordinated thing fo sho

I know we had suggested 50s Ladybug Bill but I'm totally cool just being 50s Georgia lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

I didn't think we were ever talking Bug.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-08*

yo thats like so soon

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Oh okay then good keep thinking that lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

I thought you were doing vault suit

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Bill pointed out that I could change and do both to optimize chatterbox time

I mean, it's the same hair and make up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Oh yeah

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

So it's just a matter of swapping clothes in the bathroom

I can do both

You could prob borrow my suit too, if you wanna id be game to share

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

that feels like cheating tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

We similar size ladies and it's breathable spandex anyways

Naaaah it's still dressing up to have fun so it's still cosplay

If you don't really like the idea of borrowing tho I gotcha, all good, it's not for everyone üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Nah I mean I wanted to try making my own eventually I just didn't realize that there would be shoot opportunity so soon

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

I can ask about late summer too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Up to you

**Dave** - *2018-07-08*

50's nier wit tom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

I don't know if I'd even have it done so I wouldn't want you switch it for that

**Dave** - *2018-07-08*

Make him wear a fidora

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Could still ride along for a pre war shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

[insert picture of small child saying why not both]

COULD GET CUTE ~~early~~ ANNIVERSARY PICS WITH TOM???

_share a milkshake like the 1950s_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

But then he'd need cloths too lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Tuck shirt into pants, boom 1950s man

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Greaser style is easy, ya'll have leather jackets.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

And maybe suspenders

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

yup.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Depends if you want nerd tom or edgy tom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Tru and if he even wants to do that

We'd have to bring our own milkshakes since before opening

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Yup.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

BYOM

Bring Your Own Milkshakes

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Your hair looks good for 50s too with the bleach blonde too. Georgia, you're going to do the fallout!Georgia wig right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

I'd have to style it tho üò¨

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Uhhh good question

I'd love to get my own hair redone and try to use that but that looks unlikely

Idk I sorta wanna try my own hair but I'm not sure I could do it üòê

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

I'd behind you on that one. It's an OC character, do whatever hairstyle your comfortable with.

But don't have time to hit the salon this week?

I have no idea what the light quality is there...

**Dave** - *2018-07-08*

Just have to make a trip there, *for science*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

You'd have to go morning of unless you don't wash it

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Which is not possible, timewise.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Exactly

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Oh I mean I'd be gone thurs-fri, and working Saturday, and to do it by Wednesday would be too short notice

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Well, you never know. Might be able to get an appointment.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Considering I've always scheduled like two weeks in advance? Doubtful. I should schedule so that I have my nice blonde back in time for my bday though

Also I threw it out on the RTX genderbend group about doing a private shoot of everyone, and I'm not sure anyone's gonna bite except Erik and maybe Meg

The cosplay climate is so different at RTX...

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

You'd be surprised what people can do if you ask. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I mean, you knew that going in.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Yeah

People are less into private shoots there, it's so weird

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

industry con.

said it before, better off treating RTX as a vacation with Hal.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

_damn industry con_

Its weird, but. I guess I get it

People pay for industry con, they wanna see the famous people, not hang with other fandom peeps

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

more time seems to be the thing for chatterbox, why don't I ask about late august? 19th?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

All my August weekends are shot so if that's the case I would ask them garritys

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

In that case 15th is the primary.

~~Good thing I didn't an attempt to do something for my birthday~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

RTX, North Carolina, Work, and the BNE shoot round off my August for Saturday's and Sunday's orz

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

mmmmhm.

should still see about that meteor shower tho... hmm.

<@!351471675843411978> so white balance is two sliders, cold to warm and green to purple tint. Do you know why that is?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

I won't be able to do anything on a weekday. And no

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

who said a weekday?

15th is this coming weekend.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Oh I thought you meant August

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Nope.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

K

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

I'll see if he'd be open to a second time (if he's open to the first) in August too if you want.

But there's also the diner in ledgewood and your brother's farm for Fallout themed shoots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Nah it's fine don't worry about it if I can throw something together quick enough I'll come along, if not then you guys can just go

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Coming anyway is helpful, if the lighting is bad may need assistants to make it work.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

Might be too early in the morning for me anyways,well see

Can we do this same pose but as JNPR? With Hal and Tom sticking their butts out? üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

OMG YES

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

That would be amazing

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

Ha hahaha

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

yeee....

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

I'm really bad at sewing machines

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

hahahhaha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

It's.... Not terrible? I think üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

It‚Äôs good!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

It is.... Ok üòÇ could have been better, could have been worse

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

at least you closed the edges honestly so many noras have fraying fabric

and im like oh noes your hearts gonna unravel

~~wow thats really poetic i should save that line for play by post~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

Oh yea lol that wouldn't work for a bathing suit I cleaned it up a little and now I'm fray checking it? Considering going around the edges with fabric glue?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

both couldnt hurt

itll harden the fabric so it may be a little scritchy

if you care about that kinda thing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

nah, my regular nora shirt has it too, so  just did that and ill let it dry over night. Its not very pretty close up but i think itll be fine from a distance

o also the black isn't there, thats just my bra i didnt feel like taking off

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Sometimes I'm like "yo I look the same in every cosplay picture" but then I realize that's because I recognize my own darn face

Cause looking between Weiss and Pyrrha, my expressions are VERY different

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

Yup, thats still me

not different enough

*not enough gray skin*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-07-09*



Done my Eraserhead goggles

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

NICE

EVA foam?

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-07-09*

2 layers of craft foam for each piece

There are pins at the joints for extra stability

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

oo that's smart

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-07-09*

Now the only thing I need to make is his long scarf, then to trim my hair a little bit and dye it black

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-07-09*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Could do Pink and then you have a 50's Nora dress.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

lol is that a thing?

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I dunno <@!245270932602486784> , is 50's!JNPR a thing?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I wanna stop thinking!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

what the plan for cce 2019

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

we go... swim... drink.

boom.

Same plan we have every year.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

don't drink the pool water

i'd like to do a swimsuit cosplay for a katsucon but then i remember when the whole place was evacuated and that one poor girl in a bikini with wings so she couldn't wear a jacket. sad.

katsu's pool is usually deserted isn't it

except for people jumping in in kigurumi

here it is my future cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

!ban Marisa

Oh I know dropped the ban hammer somewhere around here...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

this could be us

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i didnt even realise katsu had a pool till sunday

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

did u go in

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

nah it was too late by then

also i couldn't figure out how you got to it?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

it's outdoors i think right? like not an outdoor pool but i know there's an entrance outside. it probably connects indoors somehow too but that's a mystery.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

yea thats what i couldnt figure out, i also didnt have a suit

should I attempt to do 2b's cutouts on my bathing suit top?

i did the heart for nora and its ok, but i sewed to fast and that was my downfall

i have a hard time controlling the speed üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

need me one of those full body tights for A2 oh boy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

omg the girl cosplaying discord-chan's boyfriend is cosplaying wumpus

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

just spend 3 hours tattooing yourself, like the homestuck you are.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

none of ya'll answered my question üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

homestuck pool cosplay confirmed

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Do you want to?

Do it Jess.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

my only experience with nier is watching brownman play it on youtube

aji wo [k]utta

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i want to but am scare

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

yolo do it

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I'd say something more motivational than that, but I don't have the positivity.

tldr yolo do it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

swimsuits scare me but BE CONFIDENT

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

she's scared of the sewing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

ye

i am not good at the sewing machine

yet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

do you guys like evangelion. i have an evangelion swimsuit and they're pretty cheap. someday we could do a rei/asuka/mari group

these things

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i only saw the first movie i think

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

:0
what jams? the needle or the bobbin?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

the bobbin i think

its my own fault cuz im a mess

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

might be the tension

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i end up with like 4 threads at the bottom üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

yeah!! do you ever get a birds nest i get them all the time because my tension gets messed up

"great thanks"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

YEA that!!

its terrible

and then i never know how to tell weather the bobbin is threaded or not so i end up sewing nothing alot üòÖ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

usually that means tension is too loose, there's a knob on the side of the machine that chanGEYEAH THE SEWING NOTHING I HATE THAT

OR WHEN IT RUNS OUT

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I'mma keep deleting messages where you insult yourself Jess, ok, oky.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

you start fine and sew a huge part all carefully only to find out that the first 3 stitches made it and everything else was nothing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

YEA I HATE THAT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

and if it's a sensitive fabric then you have *holes*

that's why satin is satan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

YEA omg its teriable

the first this i ever sewed was satin RIP

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

horror story

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

have you ever sewed a bathing suit?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

yeah but i've never taken it into water. i've sewed a leotard that could probably work as a bathing suit, and nowi's top was a bathing suit that i modified but i never went into the water with it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

oooo ok neat

i was going to rip out the stitches and try again but i dont think its a good idea with that material

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

mmm yeah maybe not best unless you do it super carefully

what kind of stitch do you use for your bathing suit fabric?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

yea i think ill just go with what i got.

üòÆ

i dun know! the regular kind? üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

use a zigzag! zigzag stitches are best for stretchy fabric!
I dunno about cut-outs though, i've never tried it. for the seams definitely use zigzag if you can, but if the cutouts don't stretch then a straight stitch could work

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

It looks like this, well I cleaned it up a little more but yea that stichings a mess üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

oooo is nice!!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i also fabric glued around the edge after that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

lemme check my eva swimsuit and see what stitches that uses

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

thank! i went in blind so i guess its not too bad for first try

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

oh it's serged

ye!! did you machine stitch or hand?

machine?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

machine XD

i went to fast alot of the time

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

gotta go fast
nyooom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i think from a distance itll look fine tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

ye it looks fine

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

ill prob try on the whole thing tonight to get a better idea

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

do you have a serger because those things are beautiful

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i dun think so

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

BoJo usually has a ton of sergers i'll see how many spares she has. they're ancient though.
they're super helpful for hems. only thing is they cut as they sew, which can be both helpful and a pain

they look leik dis

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

oh no i def dont have that

i have just dis: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VWXZKG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

**heavy duty**

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i dont even know how to use most of the features, tom knows alot more than me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

the machine i use has a ton of fun stitches i want to use
i think i used flower stitches for bunny lucina but they're inside so you can't see them rip

tom the sewing guy

ooo tension knob's on the top there

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

he knows machines i know patterns, with our powers combined we can sew something

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

*that's it that's your magical girl power*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

ooo ok ill have to look at that

does the serger put in like 4 stitches at a time? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

yeah!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

whoa

i should be able to manage at least her booby cutout at the bottom, unsure about the rest https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NieR-Automata-600x338.jpg

the cutouts are pretty in depth

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

If you only go for the boob window, you could move it up a bit too. Given 2B's is a *tad* low.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

trueeee

thanks for coming to my cosplay rant <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

10/10 would purchase tickets for again

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

That wasn't a rant.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

^

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

brainstorm?

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

sure, rants are angsty ~~and probably really annoying~~.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

also before i sleep, biru, Nobel is making actual shirts of the shark shirt that nakano wears

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Pfft.

Get it.

Mousou shoot the sequel.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

I'm sure the bunny RWBY Sunday of RTX is a good social outing, but I nor Pyrrha is honesty bunny material??

It's a shame I'll lose out on socializing with all those people cause of it tho

Like I'd still love to know the real Casey

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

why wouldnt she be? i mean dont stress yourself you arent interested in it but i dont see a reason why she couldnt be

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

I mean I get that the idea is fun

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

You aren't comfortable in that type of outfit. That's all there is to it.

Go hang out to support her if you want to do that, but don't feel pressured into trying to do the outfit.

I dunno if you'll ever know real Casey tho. I feel like that's a very well guarded secret.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

I mean bunnies are kinda just arm candy aren't they?

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Bunny girl is a fetish outfit.

like french maids.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i mean under that asumption none of the RWBY girls fit the bill

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-09*

Bunny girl by definition doesn't go with rwby

except for literal bunny girl velvet

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Bunny girls itself came from Playboy bunnies, and this shoot comes from Mojojoj.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

yeet

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Mojojo provided all the concept art, which makes it easy for people to coordinate and do. Casey already did it for Easter, which is probably why she ran with it.

And of course, fanboys will love it so more followers for all the instagram famous people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Cursed sex sells

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

*any* sex sells.

You ain't about that and that's fine.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

yea like i dont think any of the rwby girls fit bunnies, but pyrrha doesn't fit any less then the others

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Go, be supportive, but you can stick to the clothes you're comfortable in.

~~if you had to run around in a fetish outfit, you'd somehow manage to hate RTX even more~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

just stick some bunny ears one and be like "there i did it"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Lmao yeah that!

Idk I feel like I'm no fun cause everyone else seems to really like the idea

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

dont do it if you arnt passionate about it you'd probably still be able to go to the meetup

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

It's a sexy type outfit. You aren't for sexy, you like powerful.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

you know me so well billiam, thats so true üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Different tastes for different people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

~~powerful woman are my type of sexy already~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

^

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

~~still not mutually exclusive <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> ~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I mean, the cross would be Panther from Persona and she already said she doesn't want to be ~~a dominatrix catgirl~~ cat woman.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

_dominatrix catgirl_ omg

yeah idk i feel like im limiting myself by not cosplaying on the "sexier" spectrum

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

You aren't.

Period.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

you cosplay what you want

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

Like,you can if you want to but you cosplay who you want

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

You will *hate* being uncomfortable on the floor because you aren't happy in the outfit. Cosplay what you want and what you like.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

Speaking of which your giant inflatable hammer came in

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

now if you find that you want to cosplay that is "sexy" and you feel comfortable, then dont limit yourself becuase its not a things youve done before

WHOO

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Georgia likes being her badass ~~redheads~~ girls with weapons and strong personalities, particularly with her squad behind her. That's what you should do. Don't think you have to be sexy cause everyone else.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

yeah i guess. im always back and forth on it because i dont WANNA do sexier type cosplays, but i wonder if im limiting myself and thereby missing out on possible fun

like i refuse to do panther, but that could be fun?

or the bunnies?

like i wonder sometimes if its a comfort zone worth breaking

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

only do them if you want too, you'll have more fun being confident in yourself anyway

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

~~I don't think panther looks good personally~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

~~she doesn't~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

you could try to break out of it if its something you feel the need to do

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

And if you want to, don't announce it or anything. Make it, wear it yourself, and if you feel confident, then say you're bringing out a new outfit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i mean 2b was way outside my comfort zone at the time

or dont even make it, just borro w something to test it out

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

~~You just like being sexy Jess~~ <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

i didnt know that though, until i tried it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

^^^^ thats what im wondering if i should be doing

but i also dont wanna be sitting around the con center with da tit and da booty feeling miserable

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Bottom line, do not feel like you have to do a sexy outfit cause other instagram people are. If you're doing it, do it for yourself and your own confidence.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

MEH thats solid advice that i really cant argue with, damn u bill

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

well if you want to test it the thats fine but dont feel pressured too

a2 is p. sexy so theres that

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

True, depending on how you make A2.

You haven't done much swimsuit cosplay right?

CCE can kinda be a test for you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

yeah A2 may be pushing the envelope in a way, but im comfortable with that cause shes gonna be fun to wear

yeah the more i think about it A2 may be a good way to test the waters in a way

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Like, if you wore the bikini to the rwby shoot and like it, you might enjoy getting some more sexy outfits in.

It's not like you won't be among friends there if you change your mind.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

tru

alright yeah i feel better now

A2 is a good test of what im comfortable showing

cause i could be canon accurate with ROBO THONG or adopt it to be a little more conservative

and either way, A2 will look awesome

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Most people make Nier more conservative tbh.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-09*

~~makes a bunny suit oz so we have an excuse to be there~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

DO IT HAL omg amazing

i mean?? alot of people make 2b more lewd then she is

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

theres probably both sides of the spectrum

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

like the shorten that skirt so much

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

ive seen A2s with basically a sports bra and some with an Ilya-type outfit

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Yup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

yea true

i wouldnt say it more one way then the other, people just do what they want

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

~~the ones who shorten the skirt are the ones with patreons~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

which is what you should do

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

There was a TwoB walking around katsu with no skirt so

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

fine, *I have seen* people make Nier more conservative.

Happy?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

self destruct cosplay lmao

if she wasnt limping she wasnt REAL

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

She only.limp for.like 10 seconds

Then she fine for some reason

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

walked it off, its all good

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

Self repair or whatever.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

I was the ONLY person to do Casey's share for share so ethan can SUCK A BUTT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

oh no I hope evie is putting darts in her neck piece or that might be really uncomfortable to wear üò±

Or is that not a neck piece

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

I think that's what it is

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

it is indeed a neckpiece

~~wait mine doesnt have darts lol oops~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

Whaaa really? What‚Äôs it made out of?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

foam and worbla

but i REALLY contoured it to be neck

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

Ooo it sits high on the neck I see I gotcha üëâ

Nia‚Äôs neckpiece wouldn‚Äôt even work unless it had darts but it was way way lower (like a necklace almost) so I assumed Pyrrhas was also low my bad

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

Pyrrhas is dumb, its like under her jawbone and down

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

The most practical place ahh yes

It helps give good posture

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

pyrrhas is stupid because it stretches with her neck in the show lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

AU where Pyrrha has those neck rings that some African societies use



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

YES

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

has anyone ever made a hoop skirt out of a garden hose
weighing my options of buying one vs making one and a tutorial suggested using hoses instead of boning
but..... what. ü§î

also i have this pink pancake fabric that i bought for bows but there's a lot of it and it might be cool for something casually nora if jess wants to use  it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

or BOW JNPR

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-10*

BOW JNPR

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-10*

That's cute üò±

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

I was thinking of posting a Konkon photo for Christmas in July what you guys think?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

YE gotta put "christmas in July" somewhere in the description tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

oh yea def

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*



What does this MEAN

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

Yes

**Bill** - *2018-07-10*



What the fuck man.

That‚Äôs Leanna‚Äôs furry friend Take_it_shu.

Fuck you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

HUH

Well that's awfully ROOD

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

üòÆ

What the????

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-10*

/forces self to hit the check out button with 86 dollars worth of worbla in the cart

ok no i chickened out and got only 60 dollars worth

it was a compromise

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-10*

That's not bad for worbla tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

Ye and it's the second largest sheet

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

Should have got the big one, you‚Äôll use it.

Lux breastplate, lux weapon(?), etc.

I had something else to yell at that emo fuck for.

Hmm.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-11*

Have u tried wonderflex

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

Dad made a joke involving the acronym PVC earlier and he was like ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt even know what PVC is‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúexcuse me, I know cosplayers, it‚Äôs PVC pipe‚Äù.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

Yeet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-11*

If worbla is too pricey, wonderflex is almost the same thing (one side has mesh on it but can be primed smooth) and the big rolls about $20 cheaper than worbla

and for super tiny stuff, instamorph. It‚Äôs like $10 for a big container and you can make all sorts of things like staffs or wands or nails or teeth

Or shoes. I made a heel for a high heel out of it once and it holds up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

Mawisa know all the secrets

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-11*

Mawisa,master of saving money

So that said money can be spent on weeb stuff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*



Why are people asking me relationship advice

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-11*

Life hack: if you cry while making cosplay then collect the tears and refine it into salt and sell the salt for more cosplay money

Georgia you‚Äôre in a relationship you‚Äôre the expert

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-11*

i disagree

I'm in a relationship with her

and neither of us know anything about what we're doing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

People ask me how to flirt with girls

I'm just like idk my boyfriend accidentally flirted with me so I'm not the expert

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-11*

Wise words from experts wow

Give us more of your wondrous experienced knowledge

Senpai

Georgia start charging a consultation fee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

Omg no

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

Cuz people are like "ooo goals" and then they think you know everything

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

Nope! Hal was just being friendly and said I looked cute and that's when I went "target acquired"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

Yea üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

I shoooould work on cosplay while I'm stuck at home but I'm so lazy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

what u workin on

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

while i wait for worbla to get here, i need to sew pyrrhas ammo bags (after a year of just not doing it lol)

and jaunes orange arm sleeve thingies

and then when pyrrha and fem jaune are done its A2 TIME WOO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

WHOO

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

Update, one hour later: I did none of those things and instead put a magnet in the back of my corset so I could attach my shield there and not have to carry it

BUT ITS OKAY CAUSE IT LOOKS REALLY COOL



Ignoring how bleh I look, my sunburned thighs, and disinterested sister, ITS REALLY COOL I SWEAR

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

that so cool!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

THANK

I get tired of carrying it on my shield so

_i fix_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

now how can i do that with the hammer

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-11*

Ooo yeah I like that üëå nice job fam

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

THANK

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

Yeet.

Now make it part backpack.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

Lmao yeah that's the ticket



I just finished my ammo bag (which is actually just to hold my phone oops)

I still like carrying my little con bag so I don't need another ammo bag for my wallet or anything

But I DO like keeping my phone readily accessible

So voila

**Dave** - *2018-07-11*

üëç x2

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

Neat.

Of note, if you have your shield on your back can use the backpack?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

I mean I can put the shield on the bracer then

Or maybe Hal will be a sweetie and combine our con bags ;3c

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

That'd work.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

I'm in jo Anns cause i had to drop lily off at college

And I got fabric for my jaune arm socks

And I was trying to think of what else I might need

And it's _nothing_

Cause I either have the fabric already, or it's only online, or I'm not sewing that part of the cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

Neat.

~~Lily is in college?~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

Oh no a summer class at brookdale lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

<@!351471675843411978> <@!245270932602486784> I haven‚Äôt heard from the chatterbox guy. You probably need to order the dress tomorrow to get it in time Jess, I dunno if you want to do it anyway or skip it. If I don‚Äôt hear anything tomorrow morning I‚Äôll try calling over there.

Georgia we‚Äôll have to explore back up plan tomorrow.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

Yea I'm still kind of unsure ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Time to play 'how many followers does Andrew get from a plug by *me, instagram... existing tlt_wm?*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

i think people gaining followers from a plug is a myth

andru count for science

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

~~he's at 54 right now I checked~~

It's not if your InStAGrAM FaMoUS WeZrEZ COsPLaY.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

:>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

my net total this week is -5 followers but i think it's the random car companies and stuff
unless car companies just really like cosplayers
also some guy in a V cosplay but the icon cracks me up each time i see it so i hope they stay

would anyone ever be interested in doing a masquerade skit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

~~what's their pic?~~

that sounds neet but id be terrified

surprisingly alot or my rwby followers also like mm and vise versa so that good

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

it's 100% normal so i don't know why it's funny
they have a lot of cute mm pics on their thing



ye maybe because all my costumes are vastly different, i don't stick with one fandom

come jess we can masquerade isshou ni

we can do a rwby/mm skit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

~~shine dance when~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

I KNOW IT WE CAN DO THE SHINE DANCE I LEARNED IT WHEN I COSPLAYED PYRRHA ~~i can do ruby in the background~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

omg that would cool, but id prob mess up and die

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

you prerecord audio.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

nah rwby can shine too

mess up the dance silly

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

yeah all audio is pre-recorded and there's a rehearsal 
it's ok i've horribly messed up on stage before at otakon people just cringe and move on

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Marisa: a better Pyrrha because she knows Shine? More at 11.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

i will be background character

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

~~Nora doesn't do background~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

~~I hate hearing audio of my voice with a passion~~

BUT JESS DOES

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

If it's a musical skit, you'd probably use the source material.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

you can also edit your voice in a software

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

YEA

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

*Hack your voice*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

depending on what the audio is you can't use it, like you can't use audio from an official dub or from the actual show

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

*hackerman*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

but music is usually ok

we could do a 707/unknown/ray/rika skit
or 707/unknown/rika/mc
707/unknown/ray/mc
endless combinations owo

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Ray/MC/Rika: *Just an orgy on stage*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

D:

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

that's not allowed stop that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

na thats V/Rika/MC

and Ray outside like "omg are you girls ok?!"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

whatever we do it's gotta involve an on-stage outfit change
on-stage outfit changes are cool

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

üò±

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

~~god she'd be an amazing cosplayer~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-12*

zenkai had one like that a few years ago that was the voltron cast crying and going "we miss our space dad pls help us find him"

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-14*

I look like I was about to laugh at something in the first but it's all a blur

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

katsu itself exists as a blur

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-14*

Yeahhhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-14*

Lmaoo yeah..

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

nah mostly cleaning out friends but i got caught up in the _nostalgia_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-14*

Oooh that spicy *nostalgia*

It'll getcha every time

**Bill** - *2018-07-14*

I should be unnerved that everyone in both of the classes I attended were kinda creepy looking 50+ year old men.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

nooo billiammm thats playing into stereotypes

**Bill** - *2018-07-14*

I‚Äôm actually a creepy 50 year old man guys.

Archery has a bunch of old people doing it too, or teen Koreans.

I should probably get a hobby I do with people in their 20s.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

~~drink? is drinking a hobby?~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-14*

As we found out yesterday, none of us can quite do a real party atmosphere.

As for non party atmosphere, you guessed it, 50+ year old men drinking bourbon. (They‚Äôre cool tho.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

cosplaying is a 20-something hobby isnt it?

by photographing cosplayers, does that count?

**Bill** - *2018-07-14*

Kinda ye.

Still be cool to meet some cute photographer girl at a class like that tho.

Maybe I should see what county has for photography classes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

are there any 20-something girls in that class?

~~are there any _girls_ in that class?~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-14*

Fuck no.

50+ year old kinda creepy dudes remember?

I wonder if the county college photography courses might be different though.

Not like it matters, I went to learn stuff which I did.

It‚Äôs like having friends/SOs into cosplay for you guys tho, people into what you are is cool.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-14*

oooo I wanna make my own flower crown

Must do research

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

But I'll try that too

fawn cosplay when

now i'm considering getting an airbrush for cosplay. hmm.
does anyone own one. i've been used as a test subject for one once before but never actually used it myself

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

I have one at my parents? technically its my brothers though. I needed it for commercial art in high school as a requirement. Ive used it but im not good at it. it takes a lot of practice. Ive never used it on people, just paintings

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-16*

let the people be your canvas

are regular airbrushes the same as makeup airbrushes?
if so we had one in shop class in high school to brush sawdust off and it was POWERFUL

üí™

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

ummm im not sure? probably, just wouldn't mix the airbrush you use fro painting with the one for makeup  there are.  ones for cake decorating too

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-16*

YE FAWN COSPLAY WOO

Deuce? He staffs at a ton of cons and has a huge web of connections. Everyone knows him.

Is this guy trying to role play with me



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

wtfff

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

It‚Äôs too early for that

I lost my room key once in a really embarrassing cosplay and the hotel was like a 15 minute walk from the con center (Otakon) so it was super awkward trying to get a new key and I can‚Äôt remember what I was wearing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

OH it was Sinon. I remember because cops on bikes kept stopping me for the huge sniper rifle I was carrying.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

OMG

thats scary

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

Pro tip don‚Äôt lose your room key

That day I went to the series meet up early because the hosts said they might not show up and I volunteered to be a replacement host and there were two asuna cosplayers. I was like ‚Äúhey! You here for the photoshoot?‚Äù And they were like ‚Äú...yeah?‚Äù And gave me a weird look. 
When the shoot started I didn‚Äôt see them but like halfway through they came back and when it ended they said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so sorry we had a private shoot and didn‚Äôt realize there was a group meetup. We thought you were trying to butt into our private shoot somehow‚Äù hehehe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

ooooo opps lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

They were super nice I didn‚Äôt even think anything of it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

casey is weraing ethans t-shirt in her story. it pains me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

ew why would someone cosplay ethan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

LMAO

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

Just think. It means she was probably out of her shirt with him at some point.

i'm cronching numbers now and it would be a tight squeeze, but i would be able to pull a (haphazard) vol 4 ruby together by katsu if it's needed at all. i can make it in a day or two but my main source of agony would be the corset-like top (to save time i was gonna make it different from how the concept art is - a sleeveless red top instead of the white button-up underneath and a pre-made black corset over that), and also stopping the stockings from unraveling after tearing holes in them. it would be better to make a v4 ruby for a later con but if y'all absolutely need one for katsu i can do it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

also is there a costume i can make out of this fabric because

holy fudge there was an Emma Frost cosplayer at katsucon and she didn't have a top. how was that allowed in the convention. maybe she only had it on for an outdoor shoot?? i saw it in a video but dang staff would've tossed her out in a heartbeat

did any of you see her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-18*

üòÆ noooo but now im curious

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-18*

i just found her in another vid omg i'll post in nsfw

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

I should post sappy for RWBY 5 year cause I‚Äôve got lots of sap for it, but eh.

Meg cosplayed Blake once too.

You know, it feels like no one sticks with Blake.

Sakura doesn‚Äôt, meg doesn‚Äôt, Georgia...

I don‚Äôt really know anyone whose like ‚ÄúBlake is my main RWBY cosplay‚Äù.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-18*

Blake is a depressed or rather sad character

Therefore people won't stick with her

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

She's getting better.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

O is today rwbys anniversary

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

Georgia what brand of eyelashes did u use for ladybug swing dress because they on fleek

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

Leanna mentioned in her story the other day she's wanted to dress 50s-y for a long time but is nervous she can't pull it off

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

Just use lots of hairspray

Eat some jello people loved jello

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

She‚Äôs got a final this morning Mawisa, ping her when you wake up.

I vaguely recall that. If we do a second chatterbox day for you and Tom should let her know too.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

Pinging is scary it‚Äôs such a powerful thing to do

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

I mean, I know admins on servers who‚Äôll ban you for pinging them sure, but that‚Äôs not the case here.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

I‚Äôm looking at a video of someone playing mystic messengers theme song on a violin so I can remember her hand movements and attempt to recreate it when I cosplay ray

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

BoJo teaches sewing lessons and we have a family friend who runs a fabric store, their powers have combined and now twice a week there‚Äôs a sewing class in the fabric store. 
BoJo wants me to help out with the condition being that I can sew my costumes in the store when I‚Äôm not needed. So tempting.

When I get back

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

:O! that mean ample workspace yes?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

OH I DIDNT THINK OF THAT
IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE NOT TO CUT FABRIC ON HALF A COUCH

That‚Äôs probably the best reason to do it there because home has literally no space we don‚Äôt have any tables
Jess u a genius

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Are you helping or getting paid?

Sounds like a great part time job.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

My pay would be space to work <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
Also Sam always gives us huge discounts on his fabric so maybe if I need fabric when I‚Äôm there he‚Äôd give it for free or like super mega cheap. 
Like, fabric that I‚Äôve budgeted over $150 for he sold me for like $30

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

id say do it, at least until you find a job and maybe after that if it fits in your schedule

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

This is the guy who wants cosplay photos for advertisements I think I brought it up before but biru if you‚Äôre interested in having your photography work as an advertisement (like probably just a PC printed sheet of paper in a window) lemme know. Also if anyone wants to be models. Probably not a big payment though this is like a tiny family fabric shop

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Yeah, you mentioned it. It'd probably do that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

dude gives good back massages he can give u a back rub

no homo

he's like 60

i should offer to help out with their social media ü§î
i went to find their facebook and it's a little lacking. their website is lookin' nice though, if a little unfinished at parts.
they've been having some trouble because all of their customers are regulars, very few non-regulars visit the mart and it's one of many shops in a huge outdated marketplace (the fabric store has been there since the 50s it has an illegal bathroom in it)
https://www.samsfabrics.com/

did you ever visit the berlin mart when u were at rowan

or andru

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

nope.

<@!141729881779077121>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

whoa they gots lotsa fabric

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

But do they have *galaxy print*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

it's rrrrrrrrrreally hit or miss. there used to be a sweet arcade but i can't remember if it's still there.
one store sells super cheap snacks (like, while packs of oreas for $0.90 and stuff) but they're all on or past the expiration date shh. i don't trust the food sellers too much. especially when the meat ones have big sales.

but ye the fabric store is nice! if you ever need upholstery foam they sell trash bags of scrap foam, filled to the brim for $5. lots of different print fabrics

ya of course theyd have galaxy üåÉ

but sometimes it's weirdly hard to find solid color stuff in a particular shade

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

I got the impression from Georgia that's an uncommon pattern.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

its not

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

there was also a card store that had those old card-specific gumball machines outside and you could get first generation pokemon and yu gi oh cards for a quarter

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

*to buy in a roll

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

nice galaxy is hard to find because a lot is just generic stars but u can find galaxy-esque stuff in every fabric store. maybe not on a roll because that's for thicker fabric but on a bolt

u could ask 'em to roll the bolt onto a roll ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

i dont think biru know difference between bolt and roll

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

dis a roll

dis a bolt

remember this because it'll be on the test

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Nope. I just made a suggestion Georgia should do galaxy print the photoshoot and we had talked about getting fabric to make galaxy print clothes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

you can find it online, prob harder to find in store

depens on what type of fabric you want too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

jo-anns always has like a whole shelf of galaxy doesn't it
in cotton or poly or something

maybe 1/2 shelf

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

yea i saw some the other day

actualy it was really hard for my to find just plain light purple cotton at joanns and i was like wtf

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

but a lot of it sucks, it looks like the floor of a roller rink rather than something classy

~~purple for lotor??~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

nooo hiyori

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

OH YEAH!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

i could only find broadcloth

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

"hello i'd like space fabric"
2/3 of it will look like this

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Oh that‚Äôs DISGUSTING.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

shh it can hear you

apologize

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

No.

It should apologize to my eyes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

yea actual galaxy print is prob easier to get online

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

it won't apologize for art

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Tis what Georgia said.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

i've started patterning and adding items i'll need for katarina. i know literally no one is gonna recognize her but i love her too much i gotta cosplay her.

moutele wasn't recognized and that's one of the most popular non-mainstream manga. ain't no one gonna recognize bakarina-sama

would anybody need a long, thin, diamond-shaped mold for anything because i can't find the right shape online and i don't want to go through the trouble of making a silicone mold for a single pair of earrings

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

You were barely in Moutele lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

yEAH BUT STILL

wasn't that the only costume from thursday
it was at least for an hour that's so much time at a con

that's like a whole hour

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

you cray girl, so many costume changed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

when our beyond the boundary group met up, we still had like 20 minutes until the scheduled photoshoot time with the photographer. there was a code geass photoshoot starting at the fountain (otakon indoor fountain). our hiroomi believed he could leave, walk to the hotel, change out of hiroomi, change into a code geass cosplay, join in the photoshoot, leave, change back into hiroomi, and be back in time for photoshoot within 20 minutes.

our mirai was already fed up with him because his pants had a non-canonical stripe on them and he didn't have a sleeveless shirt and she was like "yeah no"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

"our mirai was already fed up with him because his pants had a non-canonical stripe" damn cosplay is wild

but yea there would not have been enough time wtf

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

Would be a neet job even if it's just for space and materials

Prob good to just do once you get back for.sure

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

~~how can a person be a neet and have a job~~ ;3c

ya i think the mirai and the mitsuki offered to make his pants and shirt and he said nah he could take care of it, but waited until the last moment and bought the closest thing from walmart

here the canon and here's his stripe. so scandalous.





**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

Most likely

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-22*

she raised over $2700 at the charity auction i am v proud
I think in total zenkai raised like $3500 for their charity this year. it was in the notes i looked over, and that doesn't include the percentage of badge earnings that was also donated.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-22*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Cause Nathan messaged me about how Erik was fretting over something he wanted to give the girl he liked

And I gave nathan advice about it, and I'm pretty sure he just turned around and gave Erik the same advice

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-23*

Or maybe Nathan is doing the old 'asking for a friend' and is really talking about asking out Meg.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

He like Meg? üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Nathan? Ye.

She isn't into him.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

RIP

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Oh no its definitely Erik and his lady love if my guess is right
And yeah meg is wayyyyy not interested in Nathan

The whole conversation started with him wanting to smack erik

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

üòÆ wuuuuut

y tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

I'd say it's a shame, after all the Mist stuff he seems like a good guy, but I can hear the Ethan in the back of mind saying 'nice guys always finish last Bill'.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

If I were to wager a few reason Shes not interested because hes messaging her to much, and lives to far away

The physical aspect might have some part as well

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Plenty of good reasons. Guy's a little heavy handed, he bought her RTX plane ticket or something?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Yep

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

I just mean could do worse. Like Ethan!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

And that was like right after they met in person for the first time

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Yeeeee noooooo.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Yeeee

Also in response to nice guys finish last 
Ethan definitely finished below nathan so it's not true lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

mmm tru.

I just like lampshading that he unironically said the phrase.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

is nathan the one with the blue hair?

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

think so. myrealmaincharacter.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

ye

y he wanna hit erik?

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Erik likely being wishy washy.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

Oh for being stupid about what I ended up giving him advice about

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

oooo so not actually wanna hit him

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-23*

Somehow working on cosplay I burned my elbow

Most people burn their hands but me? Nope

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-23*

sounds like typical cosplay work

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-23*

It hurts way more than my hands ever could oof

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-23*

oof on what OoO

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-23*

The hot glue gun

I elbowed into it and boom burn

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-23*

OOOF

i burned my hands so many damn times making that flower crown and that shit HURTS

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-23*

My hands have gotten used to it by now lmaoooo

My elbow tho? Never been burned

UNTIL TODAY

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-23*

gotta build up those **ELBOW CALLUSES**

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

Huh. We have a thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

Your mom's?

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

I suppose.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

someone asked to commission a full pyrrha cosplay from me whoa

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

omg are u gonna do it

that would be so expensive

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

IT WOULD

im making a price sheet

like wow, its hard to really understand how much i spent on pyrrha

the answer is, A LOT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

i'd imagine you have to charge at least like $750-1000

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

oh not THAT much

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Hx9q3aGKIuAieoF10jB3ZCm60bdsG_BkvjUzCfOye0/edit#gid=0

heres what my price sheet looks like

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

:0

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

if someone commissions me for most of pyrrha, minus the leg armor and wig, its 400

thats crazy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

THAT'S SO CHEAP

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

_thats minus leg armor and wig tho_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

ooooo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

with leg armor, assuming i could do it, itd prob be +200 and wig is +45

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

are you paying yourself minimum wage for this costume

ooooooooooooooooooooooooo ye that ups the price

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

if i charge 400, 190 of it is pocketed by me

which is for labor

plus i keep any leftover materials

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

who is anonymous ifrit and what's an ifrit

that's pretty decent

how long do you expect it would take to make?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

depends on the piece

i could bust out a lot of this on one saturday

corsets are NOTHING to me now

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

Oof damn, commission

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

~~don't forget to charge for the time it took to make this spreadsheet~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

honestly i could afford to up the corset price a bit cause i forgot paying for rivets

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

Would be a nice lil extra cash but it'd be **work**

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeeee at least its work doing things i like

im not sure this guy wants to pay 400 for his girlfriends pyrrha cosplay goddamn

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

Yeah exactly

People don't understand sometimes

The amount of time it takes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

that's a steal yo
but yeah people don't understand üò≠

if he doesn't want quality they can buy one off ebay for under $200

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah like ive easily put 400 dollars into all my remakes of pyrrha

EASILY

messages the guy back with the link to this spreadsheet and the caption "how much exactly do you love your girlfriend"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

there was a guy at nycc a while ago who commissioned this armor for like $1800 or something and threw a fit when he didn't win a cosplay contest. it's great that they even let him enter without making it.
another time this woman paid like $1000 each for gowns for her two daughters for a formal ball, before zenkaikon had a formal. when she asked when the ball was and we said we didn't have one she flipped out, like "do you know how much i spent on gowns for my daughters?" lady pls calm down i think you far overestimated a cosplay ball

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

true lmao

gosh i feel so bad sending this guy these prices

but like, theyre legit?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah don't feel bad!!!! tbh your prices could be way higher. this is a good estimate.

you even provided a breakdown

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah i calculated labor at 10 dollars an hour, and rounded up my values for cost of materials

cause id rather charge more for materials to be safe rather than sorry

GOSH 480 IS SO MUCH I FEEL SO BAD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

IT'S REASONABLE

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

if this guy actually commissions me for all $480 worth of cosplay i will cry

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

LOOK AT THIS THIS GIRL IS CHARGING LIKE $200 FOR JUST THE CORSET (i think. it's showing me in yen not dollars.)
https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/501939430/pyrrha-nikos-rwby-leather-corset

you're charging half that for a corset so if he complains just link that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

/falls to ground

the guy asking for a commission is 16

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

wHAT

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

theres no way he has 480

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

WHAT

"hey mom and dad can i have $500 to make my girlfriend a cartoon"

this poor child don't know what he's doin

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

i think ill suggest to him that i do like the circlet, bracer, corset

thats like the core pyrrha stuff

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

was his age on his profile or is he trying to use that as leverage

like "pls lower the price im 16"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

nah its in his profile

he was really mature in messaging me tho

some people are like that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

that's good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

hes also really handy with foam whoa he made a whole halo suit

maybe he would be open to trade üëÄ 1 corset for 1 halo helmet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

that's a good idea!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

@grantsarmory if you wanna stalk him too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

he'd probably be able to make the leg armor then too

:3c thank u for username

OH IS THAT WHAT LEVEL MEANS

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

_whats the fun in talking about someone if you cant look at their instagram_

ye!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

the girlfriend already has a pyrrha cosplay :0
could really use a wig update and the corset would be nice to improve but it's not too bad

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah and for leg armor im gonna send him to meg

@megtheredhead

cause shes figured it out better than i have, i still have to update mine lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

business partners <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

OOOH maybe i could make the corset if he makes me a fallout power armor helmet

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613dU0a9KoL._UX562_.jpg

like dat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

kind of looks like davey jones crossed with a stormtrooper

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

its cool shit

thats all that matters

oof i feel so bad sending the link to a 16 y/o

but i did it

and i made a note about possibly doing a commission trade too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

you're giving him different options which is good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah! im thinking he may bite on the corset

which thankfully his GF is 5'6 and 130 almost exactly like me

so i can test fit a commission corset on myself lol

oof ive only been commissioned once before and it was for a pidge hoodie

it came out really nice tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

ooo do you have pics?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

on my old laptop :c

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

wezrez commission business 10/10 stars

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

Don‚Äôt forget that you need time to do the commission. Time is valuable as well.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah he said he had no specific date

and time depends on which articles he wants

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

Ah, kk. Cause you have some RTX crunch then A2 stuff to do, you should come first.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeah i let this guy know that i wouldnt be able to START working on it til late august

thankfully all the remakes of pyrrha have made me good at everything except the leg armor lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

Don‚Äôt undervalue time spent is all.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

yeee

You don't have a choice Marisa

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

i'm quite worried are her eyes ok
is this what they want me to do



they look very photoshopped

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

Nahhh I've seen her alot

That's just how she is

But like, she emphasizes it with the dakr makeup

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

ooo ok
i know some companies edit pictures beyond recognition and it scary

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

If you look at her other cosplays she doesn't look like that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

oh shes the nora that nathaniel got for a rwby photoshoot at RTX!

Oops she follows.me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

time to sue

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

me, posing with her at RTX: _internally_ this is not the real ren and nora my life is a sham

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

And I had no clue who half of them were lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

I‚Äôll wave when I pass where ever Hal is on the way to Lissy.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-24*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

You say that like that‚Äôs the only reason to visit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-24*

The cosplayers lol cause it's all rwby

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

~~wow unknown popular rwby charcacters how is this possible~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-24*

i find myself to be a minorly compelling reason for anybody to visit when I'm not actively doing anything

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

I mean once I get down there imma pretty much take an Uber to Lissy and then back, because I expect boozing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-24*

you could save money we'll drop you off and pick you up

assuming we don't also show up at some point maybe

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

so ive been reading a synopsis of all ravens comic appearances since this morning and now i wanna get working on that cosplay agin whoops

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

**do it**

cosplayer appreciation after looking at old photos
these guys were so kyoot



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-24*

Oof ye they cute

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

idk how to be a guy yet but it was still funny when half our katsucon room was cosplaying the main cast of this series without knowing others were cosplaying the other characters

tomorrow i have half a day off i have some spare eyeshadow i'm gonna work on guy makeup

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

i tried to do guy makeup but it look scary and i already got a stong jawline so i just leave it now

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-24*

but ur 707

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

ye when i first decided to cosplay him i tried to do the guy makeup but it was terrifying

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

Owari no seraph eh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

who?

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

That‚Äôs the series.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

oooo that was off my screen

**Bill** - *2018-07-24*

It involves vampires and magic high school, so I didn't watch it but it got lots of cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-24*

i wanna watch it

just havent gotten to it yet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-25*

don't forget its christmas y'all

oh yeah japan has a lot of pose books. they're meant for artists to use as drawing references ~~and people with fetishes i guess~~ but they could also be good for cosplay pose ideas. all the pages just look like this



**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

Definitely the fetish‚Äôs thing.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-25*

Ooo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-25*

Might be useful for ideas if y‚Äôall ever need any. Lots of books have free previews. You can find a ton by searching for „Éù„Éº„Ç∫Êú¨ or such but careful because many of them are nude üò≠

„Éù„Éº„Ç∫ÈõÜ too for online resources. Looks more drawing oriented.



~~Nora ideas maybe~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

üòÆ what is dat

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

<@!245270932602486784> Small world, Sarah Reiger works with Andrew. He was talking about cosplay and she‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI know that photographer he knows Georgia‚Äù.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

whoaaaaaaa

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-25*

Whaooooaaa

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

What so Sarah said she knows you cause you know me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-25*

If Sarah knows biru and biru knows you then who knows Sarah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

everyone

na jk i dont actually know her i just see her at things

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

I know Sarah!

She's Justin's friend

But she likes to big sister people and I'm occasionally one of her targeted little sisters at cons

She warns me a lot about nearby creepers at cons

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

She knows us.

I‚Äôm usually with you when I see her so that‚Äôs probably it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

Indeed.



Kinda neat to see Mangolooloo isn‚Äôt only interested in big accounts.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

Yea! She likes my stuff quite often

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

She follows you doesn‚Äôt she?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

Ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

So that guy that was asking about commissioning Pyrrha, and I quoted him $480 for stuff, he was like THIS close to ordering the whole thing today

Except he wasn't able to confirm it because his girlfriend (who he's ordering for) wasn't able to see him today and therefore confirm for herself

So he's gotta wait until he sees her next to get her measurements and ask which parts she wants

*finger snap* almost made 200 buckeroos

**Dave** - *2018-07-26*

keep it up my dude

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-26*

Eyy yee looks good

**Bill** - *2018-07-26*

*I wanna steal that idea*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-27*

Question <@301927856240459777> theoretically if someone were to bring a bow to a con and wear it around thier body, how would you get away with that?

Cuz it's technically a weapon with moving parts right?

Unless maybe you replace the string withregular string but you'll still be stopped most likely hmmmmmm

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-27*

yee, depends on the con. whatcha thinking?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-27*

Some cons say you can't have a bow with a string on it

At all period

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-27*

usually the rule is the bow either can't be strung, or can't be strung with any tension (so it can have a string but it's gotta be super limp)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-27*

Yeah I figured as much üò≠

It would just be so inconvenient to have to carry it

Guess you could back mount it but I was thinking of the classic string around the torso thing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-27*

I can't believe tom wants to cosplay Yona

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-27*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-27*

You might be able to do that? Depends on the con tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-27*

zenkaikon allows stringed bows as long as the tension is lax, and katsucon you can get away with it as long as it can't actually shoot anything

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-27*

I'll have to read into specifics of cons I suppose

Or at least make the string removable in case I get yelled at

Me and Jess we're tossing around ideas for Ashitaka ,but I feel like you need the bow

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-27*

ooooooo. ~~you also need the horse antelope thing~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-27*

i has a san cosplay but jess would be a better san i can be a forest spirit bobble head

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-27*

I love the forest spirits <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Nevermind scrap everything we're all gonna do forest spirits

And stare at plants rattling our heads

He was destroyed

Although he needs to get E but he hasn't yet aghhhh

**Bill** - *2018-07-27*

**Bill** - *2018-07-27*

It's not that hard Jess. Everything past E can be gotten by doing thing X at point Y in the game, and you have scene select post C/D.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-27*

seems like a pain tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-27*

All things considered, it'll be painful.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-28*

Yeah won't be that bad, bt still putting off Eeeeee

E is the best

I remade one thigh piece and hoo boy does it look better

I have yet to paint it but from the test fit it's goin good so far



I glued Velcro in to make a makeshift kinda garter too so I'm just gonna run around the house now to see if it falls

**Bill** - *2018-07-30*

Huh. Wonder if anyone every tried using actual garters for armor like that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-30*

I think that's what Meg says she does

But she also has to yank them up repeatedly throughout the day

So I did a combo of makeshift garters and also Velcro that attaches to my sock

And the socks sewn to my tights so the socks can't fall meaning the thighs can't fall

It's very intricate I must say lol

Update, I walked around with one old thigh piece on, and one new one. The old one fell down to my ankles in like 5 minutes and the new one hasn't really budged <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-30*

NICU

**Bill** - *2018-07-30*

So like, Velcro strong garters.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-30*

Technically the Velcro is at the front of the thigh piece and the garter is IN it on top

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-30*

oo neet idea

did it fall?

**Bill** - *2018-07-30*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-31*

NOPE it didnt even budge

so this strategy is super good

plus the armor piece itself is proportioned better for my thighs

AND its completely sealed in the back

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-31*

Oo nicuüëå üëå

Ye sounds better overall

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

why are the simple cosplays the hardest
i can buy full and elaborate costumes for $5, i know 5 different wig stores i can get to in less than 15 minutes in case i need a last-minute wig (one of which is open 24/7), there are entire shops dedicated just for cosplay makeup or cosplay props, and yet i can't find a blue headband and some kid's craft foam. I can find a huge roll of cosplay-specific prop foam but i literally just need like 3 inches.

suffering

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

Speaking of your cosplays, we (I) bragged about you at Georgia‚Äôs birthday, what with your 9 new cosplays every Con.

*24/7 last minute wig store*

Why Japan.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

who would want to hear about my grossness
dont exaggerate i usually cap myself at 4 new costumes for a con at max
~~i may have required that 24/7 wig store once. they also sell maid and schoolgirl uniforms.~~

unless i can buy most of the costume then there might be more than 4.

i just updated my list it made it to 3 pages

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

D:

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

now color coded to show how bad my addiction is.

i might give alibaba to paula if it fits her because then we'll have all the main characters of magi for comiket yay

i did a photoshoot for cassie's group once and they had every magi side character i wonder if they'd let us join them and form a mega magi group ü§î

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

single spaced too DAMN

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

the fact that you still have access to like 90% of these outfits is insane.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

you're amazing

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

~~Also why have you only cosplayed the fetish outfit sabers~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

~~how is school uniform bad~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

cuz they easier?

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

ssh, that's the reason but I'm teasing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

isnt saber like all armor?

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

Nah, not entirely.

But enough it's effort to make.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

i didn't want to make saber's armor hhh that's a pain. i do the easy versions

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

~~but the whole point of the white dress was to play up Saber as a sacrificed virgin or some shit~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

but look how fun she look

it was just a simple thursday cosplay to wear in line

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

she gettin married?

one day ill wear my wedding dress for cosplay

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

naw she gettin' sacrificed

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

you can try and join Audrey's idol group.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

what idols they doin?

i think every idol series has a wedding costume version

BoJo bought me a photography backdrop for my birthday, like a portable green screen but with a generic white background for photography. i can set that up and take saber selfies <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

Edgy.

Ron gave me 3 of those, but they‚Äôre colored for like, school portrait backgrounds.

They came with all the spare dslr so I said please and thank tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

OMG we should take school portraits

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

they have to be purposefully horrible too just like reality

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

i think it would be great XD

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

Whenever Georgia and I do shoots we spend 3 hours and still don‚Äôt finish the outfit we shooting. So spending all day works.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

"please take off your glasses"
"but no one will know who i am"
"please take off your glasses anyway"

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-31*

discrimination

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-31*

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-31*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

Well fuck

**Bill** - *2018-08-03*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

**Bill** - *2018-08-03*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

"hi I just wanna come to your meet up and talk about mm ok?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

I literally wanna punt some of these nerds

Like _take a fucking shower_

We got out of the RWBY panel and my patience was getting THIN

I've never been happier to escape to a Starbucks

UGH A CHILL PICKLE FOUND ME

**Bill** - *2018-08-03*

Please survive. If weebs need to be cut so be it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

OH NO

In Starbucks?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

Nah after the panel

These damn fanboys

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

How awkward on a scale of 1-10?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

100

They get all tongue tied and nervous but simultaneously also seem to assume we're friends cause they follow my content

It makes me wanna pull my hair out

A LOT of people here are just really awkward

And that's fine but it feels like I'm hand holding people through a lot of conversations

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

Yeaaaaaa I'd imagine

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

And people are like "plz hang out with me" and it's omg duck off

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

Ughhh really? üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

YEAH

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

Like nah fam I'm here to have a gud time

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

and there's people I actually wanna say hi to? Like I met Sam, Megs ex boyf, and he's really cool

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

Oh yea of course!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

Here also gives me highkey clingy vibes tho (not towards friends but like as a person) but he's really chill to talk to

And he hates ethan too

And I saw spencer, mad props armory, and he was cool but I was dashing to the RWBY panel

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-03*

Whooo!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

I hung out with a couple "RWBY cosplay famous" people? That was cool

**Bill** - *2018-08-03*

You mean normal people.

Wow.

The famous are the normal people.

Industry con is full of cringe~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-04*

Yeah normal people

All the normal cosplayers here are elevated in status cause there's so many normies

TheRES SO MUCH CRINGE THO

like FUCK U WEENS I DONT WANNA HANG OUT AHHHHH

And I don't have a safety tom and Jess and Bill

Just Halim

And mak

But they also do things that I don't wanna do like panels

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

Sorry kiddo.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

Yea I was thinking there would probably be alot less cosplay?

Or at least alot more dressed down peeps

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

And way more fanboys. They get braver with numbers too.

The type of fanboy that idolizes women for existing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

*overnights a can of pepper spray to Austin, and one to Japan*

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

Georgia has a Hal, it‚Äôs Marisa who needs it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

Everyone can use a pepper spray!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-04*

Is ok my high school taught us self defense 
Georgia go for the eyes, crushing an eye is like crushing an empty can of soda

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-04*

3 Nora's and no Rens at the PJ party

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-04*

Ooof

WHAT IS THIS NO REN INJUSTICE

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

~~Are you really surprised~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

I mean he's got the second most amount of screen time as a male so

At least I'm pretty sure he does

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-04*

world cosplay summit finales are happening and it's over 100 degrees in nagoya. rip heroes.

Casey‚Äôs secret cosplay is RWBY 3.0. Looks like Mist is there too, and E...than? <@!245270932602486784>

No idea what Ethan is, and Casey is a Black Weiss?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

Dang

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

His story reveals it, he‚Äôs dark Neptune and she‚Äôs dark Weiss.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

Yea just saw that

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-04*

Dishwasher posted Ethan ugh

Lmaoo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

Oh no his head is 14 times bigger now

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

Yeah.

That's why I saw it.

also Matt trying to talk about the picture in BNE is great except I'm like "Mist is in this and Snow is here please no thx"

https://www.instagram.com/p/BmEBbMCFw4n/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link There's the official announcement.

They do have a blake.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-04*

NICU

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-04*

"I'm cosplaying a pretty girl" privilege is so real

They started kicking people out of upstairs at 6 to close the con, but let me stay on the stairway to shoot photos with a photographer

Even when they yelled at other people to stay off the stairs

And now they're closing the venue so they're kicking people out of the building

**Bill** - *2018-08-04*

At 6? How lame.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-04*

But I was like "oh my ride is just coming" and they let me stay, and then kicked out the guy across the hall from me who said the SAME thing

Yeaahhhh they have security metal detectors (that I don't think they work tbh cause my metal corset nor metal magnets set it off)

So I guess they only contracted the detectors from 9-6

**Bill** - *2018-08-05*

Sounds shitty.

Also yes, you‚Äôre going to get away with stuff when you‚Äôve got looks.

I just realized my business cards predate my logo/signature. I... should probably get new cards.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-05*

Oh wow

That's kinda shitty tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-05*

There was this really amazing Pyrrha I wanted to meet

And she was at RTX today and got a selfie with me and



Ahhhhhhhh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-05*

Eyyyy

I feel like I've seen her before

NVM, was confusing her with another raven

I see she does the bore dores

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-05*

i'm placing a bet right now
when I cosplay ray at least one person is gonna think I'm edgeworth
anyone want to join this bet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-05*

Yea probably üò≠ that's a very similar outfit

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-05*

I was supposed to be Yang today but I was like honestly fuck it



**Bill** - *2018-08-05*

From stories almost everyone is like 'fuck it' for cosplay today.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-05*

Whooo! That cute tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-05*

THANK it's the least make up and most comfy I've been all weekend

Also I can have my blue eyes cause "Pyrrha totally got blue contacts to cosplay jaune"

**Bill** - *2018-08-05*

I mean, RTX. No one gunna comment. Be comfy.

<@!351471675843411978> I'm looking over the cameras for BNE shoot, do you want dibs on my d3300? That's the newest of them, my first one. It's got like, infinite memory because it uses SD like a camera should and not CF memory.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-05*

Yea sure!

Thank

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-05*

**Bill** - *2018-08-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-05*

I also got the A2 poster of the mousepad version you have

The guy next to me was like "nah B2 is where it's at"

And I was just like _internal anger_

It‚Äôs a beautiful print.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

We have two cosplayers from the same family too

One of them is like, our DJ?

It's the Hermonats, there's Will (whitefangcosplay) and Spencer (sayuncleqrow) here

Their sister is Annika (maykacosplay)

We now hav 12 people in a hot tub, morningmist is passed out on the porch again, hal took a toilet out of commission and passed out in our bed

Jakescribbles is asleep sitting up in the hot tub too

Labinnak ran towards me going "GEORGIIAAAAAA" and hugged me

Finally people are leaving

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Oof

Welcome to the world of cool kids.

~~sounds like the most interesting part of RTX~~

Not for the drinking (I never end up drinking heavily with a group I don‚Äôt know well) but the people watching.

Think you‚Äôve seen any of real Mangoloo through that?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

Well rip Hal üò±

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-06*

what's the final number of tally marks

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Too many

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

Yeah i saw some real Mangoloo!

She didn't use a voice and made penis jokes!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

WOOO

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

No only is there an RTX afterparty, there's an after lunch

We got like 200 dollars worth of food I think and even more people are coming to the Air BNB

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

Omg you guys

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Have you been partying all day, again?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-06*

I fuckin died last night

24 shots

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

HAL OMG

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-06*

It wasnt my intention

I was measuring shots with a double shot glass

And when I asked meg and tim about it 
They were like 'it counts for 1' so I was like ok

My intention was 12

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

what were you taking shots of?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-06*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

i was pretty worried last night about you guys

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-06*

It was a timeeee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

the lunch party is still goin and they singing hamilton

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

After parties sound better than the con.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

It's a good way to meet and reinforce friendships with people

Spencer Hermonat (sayuncleqrow on Instagram) is like my new best friend cause he had this awesome DJ machine and we talked commission prices

And I feel waaaaay closer to everyone who stayed here

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Jelly indeed.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

Very nice üëå

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

i was looking for something
and i found this
and it's really funny because i look extremely nervous

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

I think that was my photo!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

ye!! credit @TLT_WM (Trees Lay Tiny Warring Minefields)

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Throwback, kotori‚Äô16 isn‚Äôt uploaded anywhere anymore.

So that‚Äôs *exclusive* woo.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

it's on the facebooks yehaw

collector's edition

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

I deleted that album I thought.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

i think that was the con i was falling asleep at and spent like 90% in the photoshoot room because kat was proposing to her gf or something

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Never mind it was still up there.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

*don't delete it*

rare

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

I hate deleted most of the cosplay stuff when I started the Facebook page, cause I moved it there.

I left a few things behind though. Not sure what the logic was.

~~throwback to doing one album per con, if I did that now there‚Äôd be thousands of images per album~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

shoutout to looking for my rwby boots, being unable to find them, making new ones out of stilettos that murdered me in my sleep, and then finding my shoes immediately after the con in the first place i looked <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

what if i just gave out really depressing valentines day cards at katsu as ray. like, "i'm worthless trash that deserves nothing unlike you the radiant sunshine of my life. lets drink elixir and spend the rest of our days in Paradise."

bad idea but amusing concept

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

Yes and yes

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

People are going assume you‚Äôre giving out actual drugs.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

Why would they assume that that‚Äôs illegal

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Drink elixir
End up in paradise 
Sounds like Ecstasy to me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

They could be in the shape of his little magenta heaet too!  I was thinking of doing some of those for my mm cosplays

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

He was drunk pretty much the entire time I knew him what?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Lol but that ok

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

true. Aaaand facebook doesn't exactly mean 'remembers'.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

gasp. i have a purple wig and a violin and this uniform. also i can't play the violin. i can make this happen.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

DO IT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

YOU BETTER GET READY TO DIE ü§ò

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

WOOOO

Yo those pictures <@288513265661902858> <@245270932602486784> did have such good mood holy shit üëåüëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

Ye, the dude released a second set

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

nicu

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

both of them were yesterday.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

I didn't see the second <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

YE Sam really wanted to shoot a couple

And I was like "well I have some good news for you"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

that sounds violent

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Did you ever look at the website Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

Nani?

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Go look at my site.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

OOOO SOLE SHEVIVOR

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

There you go.

Don't forget the portrait tab.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

The bike picture, did you filter that or was the lighting really just THAT 50s???

Cause that really looks straight outta the 50s



Also might you be able to send me the color version of this one?

~~unless I look bad, in which case ignorance is bliss~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

The lighting is just that 50s. Lesson learned, vintage filters aren‚Äôt from filters that were popular back then, it‚Äôs just how old lighting looked.

Yeaaaaah the counter ones had a lot of splash light that made for weird color spots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

it was also due to the type of film

it was never intentional obviously

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Yup.

I can show you later.

The trick to making that photo work will be fill flash. Just to deal with the tinted ambient light.

And using the grey card.

I figured out how to use that in post and GOD it‚Äôs a blessing.

Or the other counter, actually.

Tom/Jess, now that Georgias seen em, take a look so you can see what kind of photos you can get.

We didn‚Äôt do nearly enough with the counter, but the staff came in.

I‚Äôll start a dm with Leanna later.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

mmkay

<@!245270932602486784>  are you and hal cosplaying saturday? and if so, what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

Probably wooby

I was thinking Yang

I could bust my butt to finish Yona but I'd rather not

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

okey dokey

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

You and Tom got any ideas? ;3c

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Probably MM for Saturday cuz the panel that's day I just gotta figure out which characters üòÇ

I'll cosplay MC cosplaying 707

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Rip Yona.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

A look‚Ñ¢

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

70C

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Low key actually considering it tho

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

You just need Tom shirtless as 707 running after you trying to get his shirt back.

Or Tom as 707 in MC clothes.

Since apparently clothing swaps are a requirement for *gey af* couples.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Omg that would be adorable

But he look so good as unknown

Sheet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

YEAH SWITCH CLOTHES



SWITCHING CLOTHES IS DA BOMB

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Wow there‚Äôs no Thursday badge purchase available that really sucks. Makes sense but sucks.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Yeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

There used to be the matsuri but once they moved to DC they cancelled now. Now it‚Äôs just pre reg badge pickup if you didn‚Äôt get the badges mailed

The matsuri was nice because it was free so lots of locals came out

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

**E D G E Y**

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

Make up tests are fun cause it's like "is A2 a fake eyelashes girl? Nah she's an under eyeliner girl"

_[CCE hype intensifies]_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

YEA

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

That scary good kid.

Stick with the dirty neck, long term. It replaces that one awkward plate line without being creepy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

can androids shower

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Is that already the tights part?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

Nah that's just me dickin around

I'll do some airbrush on tights for a more permanent deal

Androids can bathe I think actually??? Nines says he wants a bath at some point

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

They go in da water

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

They do the scrub a dub

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Dicking around *slays*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

I think next time I'll go a little darker on the eyeliner and a little lighter on the brows

THANK I feel like after 20 years of life I should be able to look like a tragic android if need be

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

Yeah 2B is like: we don't need to bathe and 9s is like BUT IT FEEL GOOD

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

9S uses bath bombs confirmed

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Aw ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

Now to wipe off all this fake dirt and play Nier yippee

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

North Carolina!

It's like a mini family reunion thing I guess

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

Hmm

I feel like you just did this

Other side of the family I guess

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

alexa_rynay

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

vindictive are we.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

OH YALL DIDNT KNOW HE SENT ME A MESSAGE OVER RTX WEEKEND??

i forgot to mention

it re-invigorated my pettiness

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

you didn't say anything about it no.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*



It sounds sorta passive aggressive if you ask me

But I feigned obliviousness and just said thanks

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

yeah, he sounds like a dick.

yet again.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

Like it wouldn't sound so bad if it was just congrats but I think it's the "... with the rest of us! Good job" that makes it sound shitty

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

The "finally" is what rings PA to me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

True

Like. I asked a couple people and no one thinks it sounds genuine

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

he's a cock, we know it.

He just wants attention.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

He also talked to me at RTX, just to ask what I thought of Casey's Weiss sword and then walked away

True

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

Bae everyone in the airbnb told you he was being petty

Even the people not staying at it lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

yeeeeeeeeaaah

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

This weekend had loads of shitting on Ethan lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Ethan: "This is my new Weiss."
Ethan: "She's edgy."
Casey: "Can I go back to being Nora now?"
Ethan: "Shut up woman, I'm using you to be a dick"
Casey, under breath: *"Glad you found one way to use it..."*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

LABINNAK SHAT ON ETHAN

IT WAS GREAT

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

Literally every major rwby cosplayer took a shot at Ethan this weekend

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

*Insert meme with Georgia in Weiss one side and the inverted dark Weiss from Zenkai on the other*

Normal Weiss: "Georgia"

Dark Weiss: "Georgia when talking about Ethan"

knowing him he's enjoying it, shit talking or not.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

He cant enjoy being actively ignored and avoided

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

He's *infamous*.

That's *edgy*.

Some people want attention, even the negative.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*



These two bill? lmao

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

exactly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

What is this discourse I come back too? What a DICK

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

IKR and no one at RTX talked to him except steelwolf

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Oh I saw that! What is Casey thinking omg gurl

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Not even Austin?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

Literally Ethan only hung with austin steel and casey

And half the time he ditched casey

Leaving her with steelwolf

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Wooow nice

What a great guy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

He ditched Casey at the RWBY PJ party to go to some platinum party

So thank god the Air BNB crew was there cause we pulled her right in

Otherwise honestly I think she would've sat in the corner on her phone cause she's shy

What a jerkwad

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

He's an asshole

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Yup.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

1. Not the right version
2. She might get too excited

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

Rent-a-Tom lmao

Also now that I've seen a real proposal at RTX I'm that much more angry about Ethan's fake one

That Ren and Nora that got actually engaged was PRECIOUS

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

Oh yeah I saw the video

It was adorbale

I'd be happy to rent myself out

But yeah wrong version

I bet she wouldn't mind tho lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

nanachi is a far-off cosplay plan but how freaked out would people get if I made a plush mitty with a realistic eyeball. that would fun.



this girl forgot her wig but went out in costume anyway. an iconic hero.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-14*

Legend

Oh and yeah, please do that

Mitty is terrifying

Pre Mitty is adorable

Mitty is the reason I didn't finish that anime <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

This is the second time someone's said this Nani the heck

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

maybe it is you <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Realistic artstyle, you're famous.

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

I see why they say it though, over like Meg or Gen. Congrats on being closest to canon.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

It does a little tho

Idk if it's the expression or wjat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-15*

Probably the swol body :V

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

Too strongk

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

~~So humble~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

Wait, this ring light is bad, I can't get hits from Tom's fangirls looking for more photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

oo actually now that we have that i have idea too

<@!351785752197201920>  we could do poolside cosplay photos this weekend if you want too

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

Maybee

Not sure what cos tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

anyone.  but in a swimsuit  YEA

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

~~why did you need a ring light to do these things again~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

cuz the lighting in our house is terrible

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

The best shots were near the window with a tiny tiny bit of soft lighting mixed with the ring light

But the background isn't as good



Observe

Lighting wise

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

flash light is harsh, yes. You can set up a backdrop.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

But I'd turn the light up for next time

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

~~or you have a photographer best friend with flash equipment and backdrops~~

I need to practice with the speed light and the studio lights Ron gave me.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

WELL YEAH BUT ITS NOT CONVENTIENT FOR YOU TO COME OVER AFTER WORK

For you I mean

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Asides from the fact I don't get back till like, 7, idc.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

It's nice to have the option to do things less formally that a photoshoot

Then*

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

Eh, I like to fuck around with camera too, just never do. I digress. The *real* problem is probs Jess's reaction to having Unknown taking selfies in her house. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

~~If we look at your DMs is Tom just sending Unknown selfies to Jess all day from work~~

~~irl Mystic Messenger~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

But then I'd forgo the tights and prob just do upper body android lines

Like in my make up test

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

A2, Bug/Pyrrha/Yona?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-15*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-15*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Ye

Still not a TON of options but more than I had before

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-15*

YEET

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

~~The butt?~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

Butt
**UPGRADE**

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Yeet

Oof the MM group said they take dup's but I gave them the four I can cosplay and the said do either unknown or mc but I really wanna do v that do cuz it's his birthday üò¨

~~plus my unknown looks no good compared to Tom's~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

Do V then?

They don‚Äôt control you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Obviously

I'm  not saying that. I just probably shouldn't have given a list üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

If you wanted to do V from the start, Ye.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

I only thought of it today but I got excited at the prospect of a group so I was like yea I can do all these and now I'm like opps

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

The. Say you‚Äôre doing V.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

<@351785752197201920>  would you wanna do unknown with me as v on Sunday at CCE?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-15*

Prob not

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

You‚Äôll have your own group soon, once Erik picks a guy. Tom, Erik, You, then Georgia would fall for it, grab Justin...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Mmkay

Hmmm idk I'm kinda on the edge about it now. I might just make some lame excuse for why I can't go and duck out <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

~~I'd do unknown but I look fat as him opps~~

Aaannnd now I've stressed myself out

Fuck

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

Tom is a bean pole, everyone looks fat next to him. You‚Äôre a great unknown or V or anything else, and you do what you want you crazy fangirl you.

You make a beautiful boy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

My arms are too flabby for him. I wanna go and talk to fans but I feel like I'm being a nuisance by being picky with my costume when they really only want yoosung anyway?? I guess I could explain that I don't like the way I look as him but I don't wanna seem whiny either, ugh talking to new people is hard

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-15*

Just be whoever and let your charm do the rest~

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

It is! RWBY is a special fandom that‚Äôs super welcoming. That said, if they‚Äôre allowing duplicates they have no right to complain. You tell them you want to do V because it‚Äôs his birthday  and if they have a problem with it, fuck em. Even easier way of knowing they aren‚Äôt worth knowing. Cosplay is for fun, I can understand doing a closed group for one of characters for the express purpose of a shoot BUT if they aren‚Äôt doing it for that purpose they should be happy to meet more fans.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

I mean they prob be fine with it I just feel silly

And now I'm overthinking

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

You‚Äôre going to feel that way no matter what.

Just ignore it, knowing that for better or worse you tried to do something new and exciting.

Hell, if I didn‚Äôt go when Gen and Rob posted on Sunday of Zenkai to meetup and chat, I may not have had the confidence to accept Georgias invite to shoot. That 15 minutes (*cut short by the fucking homestucks rawr*) was the highlight of that con; because I risked it to make friends.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Uguuu I'm so dumb I could have just said that from the beginning

*shoots self*

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

You‚Äôre already a great V. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

I'll say sorry a million times and they'll forgive me just cuz it's in character

Or I'll lie to get out of and not show up and that'll be in character too <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

There‚Äôs nothing to forgive tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

Biru can I borrow a camera if a cosplay V?

At CCE?

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

Yeah.



They can fuck off about ‚Äúallowing duplicates‚Äù it‚Äôs a casual meetup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Ok I'm being V

Whoooo blue hair birthday boi

The other girl doing v was like "yes plz do v wif me"

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

I saw. üòÉ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

Whoo!

Now I gotta make a necklace

I think they may be confused about the difference of a public and private shoot

**Bill** - *2018-08-15*

You think?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-15*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-16*

~~HUH noobs~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è everyone has to start somewhere I suppose

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-16*

When did 52 people be going or interested in the CCE RWBY shoot

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Really?

Still 10 for Nier!

Probably should do another round of boosts for both.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-16*

Eevee (+eeveelutions) and Vulpix are in the lead for my Instagram poll

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

i'm gettin a ponyta vibe

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

I thought Ninetales at first. But it's Pokedex entry describes Ninetales as vindictive.

Unless Ethan is involved you don't seem to hold grudges. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-16*

Someone said that too

üòè

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

*Then they didn't think very hard, or don't know you well*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Got the lean forward, got using the stool a few, and some people were like ‚Äúpls do ‚úåÔ∏è‚Äù really seriously

I forgot like half the poses I came up with so I started stealing ideas that were given

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

stOP WHY U POST THAT SIN HERE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

You look cute tho!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

OH I‚Äôm actually sitting on a STOOL STOP POSTING PICS THEY DIS IT AGAIN

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

I can‚Äôt bend my legs like that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*



It‚Äôs the same thing 
Did he delete the post oh no I didn‚Äôt steal the pics yet

Oh yeah he‚Äôs fixing the info. He originally wrote ‚Äú1st day‚Äù on the pics but this was a 2nd day costume

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

There‚Äôs so much filter tho.

Damn.

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Japanese Cosplay Photography is weird.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

Someone took a picture of how I was sitting from the side, basically I was half falling off the stool I brought. You can see it in the background of some pics. The bottom of the stool partially melted doing that woo

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

~~the filtering is probably part of your concern, it‚Äôs at the level where it becomes unflattering~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

~~but the filters are why i look flattering~~

where are any of my sewing needles right now i have like 50

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Nope. Most of the contrast is gone. Contrast is key to definition.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

s a t u r a t i o n

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Doesn‚Äôt fix contrast.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

saturation fixes everything

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

are you hand sewing? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

ye the costume i bought yesterday doesn't have the bows or the arm pieces and it looks really weird without them. i already don't have pigtails (i'm gonna tuck my wig under, luckily ranka's hair is ambiguous so i can puff it out that way) so i'm gonna make some crummy dollar store sleeves

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

whoa

i am not good at the hand sew

~~im not good at the sew period but i digress~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

u can ‚≠ê do it
it easy if u hide the horrible flaws

u are ‚≠ê fantastic at sews

the headband in the picture above is handsewed, and morg's leg thingy were made in like 10 minutes ~~but they're not accurate shh~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

*sew* says Marisa!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

i hope you made glue puns

paula was supposed to be our alibaba but she forgot when comiket was and made other plans and wasn't committed enough to reschedule those
but i went over her house to do a costume fitting and she said the pants were cutting off circulation in her legs and i was like "that's how you know it's working that's cosplay"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-17*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

99% dollar store stuff, a couple things from the cosplay makeup store to replace the stuff i used in the US
in the us i use ben nye, here i use a similar kind of creme makeup.
basically for comiket the process was...:

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-17*

üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

ben nye makes regular foundation too? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

- wipe face with wet wipe
- tamp baby powder on face to get rid of gross
- cream makeup
- skin-colored cake from the 100 yen shop
- contour with brown eye shadow
- glue eyebrows
- skin-colored powder from cosplay makeup shop
- fake eyelashes
- eyeliner and eyebrows

ughHHu idk if it's regular foundation, it's the same stuff I used for homestuck but just skin colored oops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

That's probably what A2 had before she rolled around in dirt and shit lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

a2 shops at hot topic its canon

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

"How do I get edgier"

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

`10:46 AM] Aldus (Jess): only $8.50`

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

but the reviews say they tight on the thighs

which i have a problem with alot cuz SURPRISE women have thighs

so id rather see if they have em in store

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

I never noticed.

Ever.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

cuz clearance is final sale

well apparently fashion designers haven't

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

~~Thighs are life~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

Wooo moneyyyy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*

Okay so since I'm ditching the complex A2 idea cause I don't have the monies to spend ~~and wouldn't wear the swimsuit again~~, I'm just wearing the bikini

Which leaves the question of how to do the lines

SO I did a make up test cause I was curious on how thicc to make the lines

~~this is just a swimsuit but Idk if I should put it in nsfw so I will ~~

I did this for funsies



And then I realized that Homestuck was too present on the board for me to want to post LMAO

When will insta get text formatting üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Never, instagram is intentionally feature starved.

It‚Äôs a shit platform.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-21*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*

I was thinking about how RT said they were releasing new Pyrrha and Ren pajama designs with the next Grimm Eclipse update

But they never said exactly when that update was dropping

So now I'm just like _it could be any day now_

You know that I'm gonna start the cosplay as soon as it drops

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Grimm Eclipse will never get love.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*

Except for the one day the pajamas are released lmao

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

it... won't get love.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*



I was gonna wear a bikini for Pyrrha but I like the swimsuit anyways?

And I get lifeguard vibes which Pyrrha would totally be

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Maybe, but I‚Äôd worry people would ask if you‚Äôre cosplaying baywatch.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-21*

How hard would it be to put a logo or something on it

Cause if you could get pyrrhas symbol or something on the front that'd be cool

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Oooh, no, that‚Äôd completely nail the lifeguard feel.

But, Kirsten has been making her shinon swimsuit so she might know how to paint it on.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-21*

Yeah the life guard feel would be perfect for pyrrha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*

Yeaaah but I don't wanna ruin the suit I'd probably wear normally anyways

Swim and drink con is casual anyways so fuk it

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Tangentially, make sure to bring something with you to wear walking to the waterfall when we take photos. It‚Äôll probably be chillier than just a bikini weather.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*

Besides my soon to be "Great One" shirt? üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

I was thinking A2.

I know you‚Äôve got clothes for Pyrrha planned.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-21*

I could make a yorha sucks shirt

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

Sure? Just something to stay warm. The con center can be cold iirc and going outside and walking to the waterfall may be as well. September and all that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

Hoodie JNPR rises again

SIGH they don't carry the swimsuit in stores

The swimsuit section lady was nice but guest services was ROOD

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

You shopping?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

YE

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Nice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

No luck, target does carry any red swimsuits for some reason

The only one I found was an XS lmao

Wow customer service were such jerks and the one lady working alone to restock swimsuits was so nice

Like she tried to help me find a similar one

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

That‚Äôs nice.

Also target is red themed, it‚Äôd make since for them to have a red suit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

oh my god im actually thinking of writing a dissatisfied email

im becoming my mother

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

~~they ain‚Äôt going to read an email~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

~~theyre a multi million dollar company, they don't give a shit either way, but you might get a coupon~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Indeed, you need to talk to someone high enough to do something but still connected to the store in question. Ie store manager.

Or, let it goooo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

oh i meant the manager

and to be fair id be giving kudos to the nice swimsuit lady that tried to help me find an alternative

_and then rip into the customer service lady_

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Criticism is louder than praise.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

like i worked 11 hours today and i did not want the rest of my night to still be treated like a secretary hmph

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

I can hear you wag for finger. üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

Y E A H

now imma go hunt for a bikini top not from target

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

For Pyrrha again?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

yuuup

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Rip lifeguard mode.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

THEY JUST CHANGED IT TO NO LONGER SOLD AT MANALAPAN

probably cause i asked wow

a target in middletown allegedly has it

imma call

laaaame they dont have it either

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Aww.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

ama-zon kenobi, youre my only hope

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-22*

~~get it there~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

A trip is a word.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

https://www.amazon.com/Underwire-Vintage-Bikini-Sports-Bra-TX802-SRD4/dp/B072QTBTNF/ref=sr_1_68?ie=UTF8&qid=1534902957&sr=8-68&keywords=red%2Bretro%2Bswimsuit&th=1&psc=1

though honestly i only need the top portion of each

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

First one is more Pyrrha.

If it has prime shipping we can hook you up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

which makes the total 37 dollars

So basically you two Fourth of July.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

someone said "my new cosplay has a helmet so i can cry and it won't be noticable."
relatable

so how do y'all store cosplay pictures.
I have a few flash drives with most of my pictures on them, but then every time I want to post from my phone I usually save it as a draft on tumblr and then screenshot it from my phone and it's annoying.
biru's pics are easy because you just have to find them on his site or on flickr and download them directly from there
is there an easier way

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

You were blind!

Did you have your glasses off

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

that was during winter break so i was nocturnal. and i hadn't slept in like 20 hours because i sleep during the day

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

I don't remember

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

i did when taking pictures. i was in stilettos because i couldn't find my rwby boots and had to improvise

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

it took me like 5 months to realize she was the same person

i am not good with people <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

oh crabcakes how am i supposed to complete a collage of the alphabet if i can't find pictures. oops.

10 year old cosplays

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

nhnnnnn fdzz bad

what even are wigs

the outfit itself isn't bad i wonder if i still have it anywhere. i could bring it back



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

üòÆ

who dat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

Koyuki from Sgt Frog
what a cute

i want to do all the Sgt Frog cosplays

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

DOIT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

oh and she doesn't always wear the blue mask that why i didn't bother making it

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993> 
I have Natsumi, I just have to actually wear her.
there's koyuki if I can find the outfit (here without the mask)

momoka's outfit would have to be made, but Mois's would be the hardest. unless i skimp out and do her untransformed version which I basically already have but we want ARMAGEDDON

wait when you said "who dat" did you mean the character or the person i'm with. oops.
she's a voice actress, trina nishimura. now she's best known for mikasa in attack on titan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

OH i meant the character but OMG mikasa

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

i did it. into the story it goes. posting here so i don't have to screenshot off of tumblr <:lenny:395307171539189760>



new cosplay photo storage idea
a personal discord

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

cosplay sounds so weird in japan

so different

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

sounds terrifying

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

it strange

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

It's so popular that they need laws to control it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

even at comiket i was asked to move because swimsuit cosplays had to be hidden deep within comiket's inner cosplay areas and not in the outer cosplay areas

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

America it's a smaller sub culture I feel than Japan, but perhaps I'm wrong

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

they have a ton of resources for it, tons of events every month, specialty shops in every major hub, several magazines (just for makeup, just for costumes, etc. etc.) but it's highly policed

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

Likw if you could cosplay at the water parks in Japan perhaps there'd be cosplayers everywhere

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

there aren't really any "fun" costumes either. it's written in event rules that if a guy wants to dress as a girl he can't have excessive body hair or any facial hair

o here a picture from the park



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

AHHHHHHHH

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

i've been to a cosplay event on the beach once, and it was very strict. we could only go to and from the beach if accompanied by a staff member from the cosplay studio (which was essentially a repurposed apartment turned into photo studio)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

OOF

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

they had permission to use one little strip of the beach and we absolutely couldn't leave that area or go further down the shore

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

what happens if u leave?

they shoot u?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

~~they shoo~~ YEAH

idk maybe police arrests you

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

üò±

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

That's crazy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

I think it's because of the really horrible association people make between anime and people here. it's kind of double sided. there's a lot of it and it's fine to watch mainstream stuff, lots of people do. but get deeper and you're super weird.

kid i was speaking with once at musashi: "oh you like anime? me too! what's your favorite?"
me: "oh i watch a lot of stuff. right now the best is akatsuki no yona"
moment of silence, kid starts laughing "oh wow you're an otaku huh"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

OOF

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

LMAO

BODIED

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

anime fans are associated with murderers and debaucherers so maybe us dressing up like fairies poses a threat

legit read an article earlier this year about a guy stealing safety whistles that elementary school kids carry around. he would wait in parks and steal the whistles or ask them to blow it for him. when word got out, the news outlets were like "there's an anime....... that has whistles in it............ this man must have seen that anime and gotten a sick fetish for kids whistles and started doing this because of anime"
MAYBE HE'S JUST A FREAK WITHOUT THE ANIME

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

WHAT OMG thats like people with "video games cause school shootings"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

YEAH japan is like that on a biiig scale

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

Omfg

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

They‚Äôre very strict with picture permission and photography is banned at all non-cosplay events because if someone‚Äôs image goes public they could lose their job and whatnot. Peoples faces are always blurred or censored if they‚Äôre in the background of an image.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

id be terrified yo

like theyll fire people if they find out they're a NERD?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

Ya nerds are obviously very dangerous and an embarrassment to society

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

could you image doing like really good at your job and your boss calls you in and fires you for for cosplay?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

That Swiss guy with the loli hentai was fired multiple times but also he‚Äôs got some issues

Rather than be fired in japan they ‚Äúrespectfully resign‚Äù

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-22*

"force you to quit?"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

You got it <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

When CCE is in 2 weeks and you still haven't met your weight goal üò≠

No one let me eat anything for the next 2 weeks

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-23*

And it won‚Äôt be a new moon oh no
Some girls in my high school would diet by only eating celery and hot sauce. I don‚Äôt think it was a very good diet

Girl u fine

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

ü§î I should try that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-23*

Think of the RFA

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

I've been eating way to much PB, dark chocolate and low carb ice cream. üò≠

Oh no! They'd be so mad at me

So disappointed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-23*

^^^

what else are people supposed to eat if not that

that's my entire diet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

TIME TO GET SERIOUS. I gotta drink moar water

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-23*

Spongebob cosplay wow

i'm amazed and scared

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-23*

Woah

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

You look wonderful Jess, weights just a number.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

BUT GOALS

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

A number shouldn‚Äôt be your goal; how you look and feel should be.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

i feel better when the number lower

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Mangolooloo has been pushing her patreon more hasn‚Äôt she.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

She's having problems at work

Needs the $$$ probably

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

You get to be a part of a special discord role now for her lowest tier

Its been added

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

*Oh wowwww that‚Äôs all I wanted*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

Like its not by itself

She added it to her already existing lowest tier

But yeah

Isnt it wonderful

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

So the stain from my makeup on my Nora shirt isn't coming out, im trying one more thing but im not going to be home tomorrow into Saturday to make a new one and I'm not up to it tonight.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

What the stain made of? üò±

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Foundation üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

Have you tried makeup removing wipes and anti-grease dish soap

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

I tried makeup remover, dish soap, bleach and shout

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

Wow I‚Äôm surprised the shouting didn‚Äôt work

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Lmfao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Fus ro DUH

Huh stain is still there

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

üò¢

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Yea so I'm kinda at a loss on what to do? Like I ahve to wash it again to find out if what I did will work but I won't be doing that till Saturday afternoon

Even if it does come out I still have to out the insert back in to make the heart shape hold and bleeeh

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

Laser removal

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Fabric paint maybe?

Or, to heck with it. Be V and focus on the photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Maybe? I feel like that would be even more obvious and then the stain

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I wouldn‚Äôt know, honestly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

But then we won't has a Nora üò£

Unless there's another coming

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

The other Nora is just a cardboard cutout of a picture of jess in her Nora costume

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Yea there we go!

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

There isn‚Äôt, but we already don‚Äôt have Jaune.

So JNPR RNJR aren‚Äôt happening.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Nah I'll be there, my shirt might be either stained or not canon but I'll be there

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Ooh.

So you have to redo the shirt anyway.

Why don‚Äôt you own it and make a battle damaged shirt.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Either way I have to out some work into it

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

True, but ruining it has to be easier than fixing it. üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

It the stain comes out I still have to put the cardstock in that use to make it Stand up, if the stain doesn't come out I have to remake it

Eh I think it would look weirder to have a pristine outfit with just a banged up shirt

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Marisa and Georgia might have a way to damage the skirt and jacket.

Non permanently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

I could just wear the white shirt, no cut out which is why I said non canon

Na I wouldn't want to do that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

Battle damage is actually weirdly difficult to do. You could light it on fire and drive over it with a car but that doesn‚Äôt always work well. Controlled brushing has the best effect.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Yea I'm not into it. Not when everyone else isn't doing the same, it would just look like Nora doesn't know what a washing machine is or smth

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Tom, put makeup on Ren‚Äôs pants!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

Ew no then I'll have more work!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Weird question but would your swimsuit top work? üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

Cosplay quote challenge but Ray‚Äôs quote is just ‚Äú*uncontrollable sobbing*‚Äù

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Oooo morning mist had plans to cosplay Pyrrha

Interestinggg

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Hmmmmm

Do I smell copycat<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

OOOH TOM I WASNT EVEN THINKIN BOUT THAT BUT YOURE SO RIGHT

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Oof

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

I might be able to use swimsuit top. And wait how is she a copycat?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Nah we're just being conspiracy theorists

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Ye <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Oooo she also has Raven on her cosplans

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

TT raven or RWBY raven?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

~~or rune factory raven~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

TT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

another harvest for the eventual raven rainbow

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

She actually put "do you believe in destiny" so I guess she could be cosplaying Cinder too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

next person to cosplay raven has to do this version

PLZ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-24*

u gotta

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

A2 wig out for delivery OH YEA

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

üôå

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Whew

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

tom and jess, what kinda material is your 9s and 2b cosplays made from?

like a kinda stretch almost suede type material?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Yrah

It's interesting

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

hmm. What are you doing for the clothes part of A2 Georgia? You've only really talked about the tights and lines.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

sewing presumably lmaooooo

would you describe it as a heavy fabric

cause i have two options, heavy suede and light suede

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

It's ... Probably heavy

Although not cumbersome

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

its pretty heavy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

https://spandexworld.com/c3/catalog/product/17398#product-attributes

https://spandexworld.com/c3/catalog/product/11720

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

ooohard t tell which one it would be

i think for a2 youd prob wanna do light, i think 9s and 2b are heave cuz their outfits have to hold a certain shape

a2s doesnt cuz its skin tight

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

and if you think about it, the belly part of her shirt is that almost sheer material.

so it's definitely on the lighter side.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

ones 90/10 polyester/spandex

the other is 95/5

yeah i think im gonna go light for more stretch

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

yea saw that, dont hink itll mke much difference in the end but id do with the lighter and stretchier

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

it recommends this material for work out clothes what?

who works out in suede lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

right? lmao

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

oh, you thinking of doing the cheer group Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

nah i just wanna see what everyone else does

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

sounds about right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

though if im free i may dick around and be football yang or something

cause thats just a funny idea to me

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Facebook be like "Look Georgia's doing this cosplay group" and I be like "I'd know if she was <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

HELL YEAH

bill has the 411

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Doesn't Leanna want to do that?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

i think it was me that suggested she do that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

NOW THATS AN IDEA

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

cause that was my initial reaction to the event

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

~~nora doesnt strike me as a chearleader either~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

YEAH

NORA YANG FOOTBALL

i have one free cosplay slot for katsu so im gonna see what ill do

ill keep on eye on rwby 3.0

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

WHOA whats your katsu line up

i dont have one yet whoo!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Pyrrha/??? on friday

A2/Lux Saturday

Ann Sunday

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Pyrrha, A2, Lux...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

though theoretically lux is interchangeable

shes an armor build tho so i have a slight preference for saturday

A2 is definitely saturday cause ill have BIG SWORD MCSMACKYOFACE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

oooo neat

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Boy I hope everyone doesn't pull out awesome stuff at Katsu that I want to shoot, because shooting *sucks* at Katsu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

thats kinda the whole thing at katsu tho

like thats the "premiere your new shit here" con

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

yeah but it's hellish to do photos indoors, it's *so* overcrowded.

Too many people premiering new shit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

cause katsu is totally over capacity with its venue

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

yea but thats not how people see it

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

It's going to be different for the cosplayers anyway; cosplayers want photos and attention and for alot of people to see their work.

It's me who wants a photo without a troupe of love lives in the background.

I'm going to make myself miserable at Katsu, I mean, I know it already.

I'd be more miserable refusing and not taking photos of everyone's hard work, just doing nothing while I'm there than stressing decent photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

i have one(1) plan for katsu so far

after CCE ill see if i wanna try something more daring

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

~~darling~~

üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

1. I havent even seen that
2. I mean build wise

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I know, if there was a typo it would have been funny so I faked the typo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

What is katsu plan üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Mystic Messenger.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Mys messsss

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Ray x Ray x Ray ~~orgy~~.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Owo nicu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

~~technically its ray, saeran, and unknown~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Weeee shooould do teen titans sometime next year too, that cosplay thing had be thinking about that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

like we're not all wearing pink suit here

YEA I WANNA DO THAT STILL

i can get it together p. easy if i have a goal date, i just work better with deadlines lols

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

i was thinkin zenkai -w-

cause my summer cons are highkey limited by internship

and this is one of those cosplays thats a lot less fun alone

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Otakon is a few weeks earlier btw.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

so i saw

hue gen got the same color and style clip that i got for pyrrha

nice üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

yea we can shoot for zenkai!

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Ryan didn't go last year, but if he does maybe he'll bust out beast boy for you.

Since Tom doesn't want to embrace the body paint/homestuck.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Ill be robin or nightwing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

<:yay_makoto:372193112920948756>

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Which version btw

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

teen tootans

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Which titans tho

Movies or tv show

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

tv tootans

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

~~the only one anyone will recognize~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

~~the less skin showing starfire~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

‚òù

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

maybe i should do volume 4 yang............ i dismissed the idea before but im thinkin bout it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

~~also i dig the casual titans so if u ever wanna do that with me~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

we could do casual on a thursday!

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

or for a day con.

There's a few of those in the year.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

ye or a sunday

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*



Both of these are v recognizeable

And im not sure which is technically showing more skin

Wait nevermind 2nd doesnt have boots she wins

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

and everyone recognizes the tv show because it's the only DC property that was popular.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

i think that starfire qualifies for NSFW chat tbh thats how much skin that is

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

good point.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

YE

LOL

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

but the points been made.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

~~it was the only DC property that was GOOD so i hear~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

False

Young justice was bangin

Also the DC animated movie universe is p good

Also justice league unlimited and its affiliated shows

DC has really solid animated shows

Static shock anyone? Also all of the batman's

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

~~I'd agree but some people here like DC ‚òù~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

yea ive heard those are good!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Theyre all great, at least as good as teen titans

Id say Young justice is a clear step above

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

yea my coworker liked it alot

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

~~its also another property that got shortened because to many girls liked it just like teen titans~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

,... what?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

YUP i read about that

the intended audience was boys but they got too many girls watching it so they were like "opps wrong demographic" or someshit

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Basically they want to sell toys right

But they market to the bois

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I got it Hal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

girl not allowed to like super hero

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Ryan's a better beast boi üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

_excuses_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

youd makes a great BB if you wernt afraid of body paint

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*



I don‚Äôt have the heart to comment you looked even better in person on the post. üòÜ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

WHEEZES GINNY NOTICED ME

Georgia in the 50s is getting good feedback üôå though I did lose a follower

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

*Alright maybe I do a little bit*

That mean we should do more you shoots? :3

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

OH YO

So my old karate teacher is super into magic

The gathering

Sent me this message earlier



And hes serious about knowing the dude

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

_you get paid to cosplay?_

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Like hes realllllyyy big into magic

Potentially id have to make a really solid costume first

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

are they literally just asking you to be a cosplay model and stand there at the tournaments?

is this REAL?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Basically? From the sounds of it 
I make a good cosplay, come to hang out during some small tournaments and get get some extra exposure. 
Then i can snowball up from there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

H U H

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Real talk

I did not think this connection would come back around likr this

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

‚ÄúFor exposure‚Äù is sort of a buzz word for ‚Äúscam‚Äù in art tho...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

From anyone else id say the same thing

But this dude is my former karate teacher

Who is so christian and straight honor based

That even after the person who owned the studio ripped him off

When people wanted to go to him for private lessons or just mutual practice  he wouldnt out of respect

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

~~also halim wants to be there anyways lets be real~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Yeah i love mtg too xD

Though i dont think my decks are tournament quality

This dudes helped me get into other stuff before hes reliable 
Not scammy 
Also tbh id be adding a whole new fanbase to my cosplay

And its a devoted and big one

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

of Ma G I c nerds

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I‚Äôm not trying to attack his character, promise. I was big into magic a few years ago, and this info may be outdated, but I‚Äôm remembering the pro tour word finals for Magic. Specifically, the fact that it looked like they barely had the budget to afford a camera to stream with. Wizards does not strike me, in past things, as a group willing to spend money on cosplayers who stand about. There‚Äôs very little money in tournaments as well with Magic as well. Product is the usual prize. 

I‚Äôm saying that if the monetary angle is important to you; get all the information before investing hundreds in a show quality cosplay. Magic outfits aren‚Äôt simple, even Jace‚Äôs edge lord hood will be an investment. I just don‚Äôt see, again, based on what I‚Äôve seen, not new info, anyone in Magic paying a cosplayer.

I‚Äôm all for you adding magic to the cosplay portfolio tho. Magic has GREAT designs.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

d a m n

good thing rwby aint like that phew

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Lol yeah i dont trust wizard as far as they can throw me

I was menti9ning it cause i was wondering 
Would anyone wanna magic cosplay with me now i have a convenient excusee :3c

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

RWBY isn‚Äôt paying you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

not meeeee

but they did some cosplay collabs at RTX

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Hit up Tristan for magic cosplay.

He‚Äôs big into it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

ye its like half his insta

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Mmmm nah

I dont like tristan and magic 
Like mad respect for what he does with it 
But its too intense and he plays the way i hate

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

~~cheap?~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Hes one of those "instant death" deck types that kills the game

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Cosplay isn‚Äôt play tho....

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Nah but the way he approaches magic as a whole is what bugs me

Idk how to describe it

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

He plays combo.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Im fine with him outside of magic but in it nah

I dont wanna deal with it

I dont mind if we both cosplay magic and hang

But like i dont want to set up a magic pair with him

Like 
I wouldnt want to do a specific cosplay group with snow in rwby 
Like i wouldnt want to do rnjr with her

But if we getting a large group together or theres a bna rwby cosplay meet up id hang out with her

Or id hang with her in another context to

Cause shes not somebody id want to do a close cosplay group with?

Idk how to explain it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

agreed

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

When it comes to tristan and MTG thats kinda how i feel

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

That‚Äôs about Snow‚Äôs person, not about how her opinions on Ruby.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Yeah but its not tristans opiniond on magic

Its how he approaches and acts around magic

Thats a person thing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

people can be kinda different in diff enviornments too

tristan could be annoying when playing magic because he instakills and doesnt make the game fun

even if hes a blast to play overwatch with

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

He plays a boring game

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

kinda like how georgia in cosplay has a lower patience threshold than regular georgia lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

He can be. But not wanting to spend time with him one on one because of the way he does magic is more about him as person than the game. My old roommate played a 80 counter spell deck in edh. He was a dick with magic, but I still roomed with him.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Yeah thats what i said

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

He plays to win and only win?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

^^^^^^^

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

~~Sneasel deck~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

lmao

forgot about that

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

I dont like how be behaves when it comes to MTG as a whole

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

i didnt know sneasel was broken to be fair

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I‚Äôll never forget.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Infect proliferation decks tho

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

And we were playing in a busted manner. Pok√©mon is only supposed to play one set at a time.

What I want to know if it‚Äôs just magic or somewhat him as a person. At Otakon he asked if he could room with us at Katsu, as he has no one else to room with.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

nah hes just awkward

hes a good dude

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I‚Äôve thought so.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

he comforted casey when she showed up to katsu post break up

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Cause he crushes on her

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Better him than Ethan.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Almost anybody is better than ethan

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

And while I didn‚Äôt tell him yes, I lean yes as we aren‚Äôt full at all at Katsu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

he also does fill for overwatch

which i know means nothing

and yet

it means something

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

The only think that gave me immediate pause was he said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to guilt or pressure you; but if I can‚Äôt stay with you I won‚Äôt be able to go at all‚Äù. Poor choice of words, probably. But it struck me the wrong way.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Ew

That is a really bad way to say it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

he recognized that austin was a cuck and kicked him out

i swear hes a good persoonnnnnn

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I believe it Georgia.

No worries.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

He did that after austin seriously fucked him over tho

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Like I said, I want to know if it‚Äôs magic or Tristan Hal doesn‚Äôt like.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Not sure at this point

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

That‚Äôs all. Not worrying about Katsu till after CCE. Long after CCE.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-24*

Most of my interactions with him were surrounded by magic -.-

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Mmkay.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-25*

Followed by all of the elder scrolls.. wow ee

Pay no attention to that conversation in the back <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Woweee!! Also lmfao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

***blind and sticky?***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Yea!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

~~bae we gotta go to the garritys theyre making pancakes in the dark~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Lmfao!!!

I'm not even with Tom right now üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

~~I don‚Äôt want to know what you think blind and sticky means if it requires bring Hal~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-25*

I dont want to know either bill

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Lmao we we're talking about bnha cosplays

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

Hello my name is A2 and I enjoy killing machines and stabbing hot androids

I found these shorts that are swimsuit shorts? Idk how I feel about them

Ooooo I'm doing a make up test I'm not strong enough to resist

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

üî•üî•üî•

Dang girl  looking good

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

That‚Äôs a nice white.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

I'm a weak bitch that gotta draw lines on her body

Also I think I'm sticking with the bikini bottoms

The shorts are less flattering



**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

Yeah, you looking good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

Now I just need a cover up and to sew some arm piece and A2 is donezo

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

Got the thigh highs already?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

Ordered, haven't arrived yet tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Are you only gonna do in thigh high?

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

If they go any higher, wouldn‚Äôt they be pants?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

What about the thigh highs?

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

I‚Äôm guessing your going to use the falsie eyelashes too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

Probably not

It's not very "A2"

If I use any they'll be smol

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

Oh? I vaguely remember her having sharp eyes.

I thought it was makeup.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

That's probably moreso eyeliner

Or at least, eyeliner would work best on my teeny eyes

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

Aaaah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

One day you have to teach me fake lashes

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

Learn something new every day.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

Hoorah I can

I used to be meh at it but after soooo much time I got the strategy down

That one person daydreamcosplay has been posting Pyrrha boudoir

And the caption on the last one was "do you believe in destiny"

Which is kinda an odd pairing

Like destiny? For the booty?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Booty = Destiny

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-25*

Booty is lyfe

**Bill** - *2018-08-25*

Destiny to fuck.

I though daydream‚Äôs thing was Blake.

Sigh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Yes I just saw that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-25*

SIGH

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-25*

Erik's with dem too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-26*

~~my guess is that they both like hanging with casey and call on eachother to be back up 5o deal with ethan~~

Pumpkin petes gone through some shit

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-26*

battle ready pumpkin pete

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-26*

Damn

Pumpkin Pete needs rehab

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-27*

mentioned in BNE but aliexpress is having a sale today (this week?)
it pains me that so many costumes can be bought for way cheaper than they can be made because i want to buy them all

violet evergarden is down to $50 hhhh

uwowo is a good name

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

Buying a Weiss cosplay?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-27*

no i just like the name

i finally bought haine so i'll have him by november. more people will recognize him at a japanese event than in the us

considering an inu x boku uniform since it's $13 and I can use the shirt for ray, but i'd get it shipped to the US because that's where my karuta wig is

it looks *really* meh though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*



I got that swimsuit by the way!

The top is too small üò≠

So I'm gonna try to exchange it

I'm hoping I can just exchange the top cause the bottoms fit PERF

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-27*

from target?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

Nah from Amazon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-27*

is this for pyrrha?

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

is that too small?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

Ye I just needed the top so the bottoms are a bonus lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

I thought you were at work.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

I am I forgot to share this last night lol

But yeah the underwire is like on da tit instead of under

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-27*

it looks good, hopefully you can exchange just he top

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

mm, does look cute.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

yeah the bottoms are comfy and the high waist is apparently in

its just the darn top is too small

and its a LARGE

so im gonna get the XXL cause the L was very obviously VERY small

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

wooooow that's clickbait.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-27*

Right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

Yeaaaah

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

rich actually going back to compare, nicu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

I think most would say pre war georgia lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

most people prefer your cosplay tho.

well, not prefer, but follow you for that.

Speaking of, if you liked that Mojojoj Weiss from last night, an outfit that‚Äôs white and soft would work for both Weiss and yourself.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-27*

reordered the swimsuit in XXL

its more important that the top fits more than the bottoms anyways

and i can prob sew the bottoms better than the tops

curse my weirdly proportioned body

**Bill** - *2018-08-27*

No one is correctly proportioned.

ya'll gave meg the curse.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-27*

may she RIP

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-28*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-28*

i knew it. i imagined a whole conversation where they were like
"hey can you pass me a choker"
"oh it looks like we're out in the kitchen, let me fetch one from the living room stash."

**Bill** - *2018-08-28*

Canon.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-28*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

There‚Äôs a tweet going around that‚Äôs basically like ‚Äúyou want a cosplayer gf? Good luck having an always messy house‚Äù
So a girl posted this which is basically ‚Äúmy bf is a cosplayer and he made me a wedding dress‚Äù



It so pretty



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

Ommggg

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

It‚Äôs beautiful.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

Jess at tom:
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a cosplayer now make me a wedding dress‚Äù

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

But we're already married! üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

Post-wedding dress

~~rennora cosplay wedding~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-29*

It is really pwetty

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

i was looking for pictures that probably don't exist of an old cosplay and i found what i think is an old otakon facebook group? but the group has a ship name and apparently was taken over by someone who kicked out the admins and made it political. something went down in that otakon facebook group.

how do you make a 2013-era cell phone picture that was uploaded to facebook look decent
can that kind of ancient image really be restored

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Nope.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-29*

apparently ethan joined the coffee wars

but i cant see what half assed attempt he made to join in

_because then he would get mad_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

do people get notifications if you screenshot their story

i can post it

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Ethan doesn‚Äôt know who you are so...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

ye but i don't want to screenshot it if it sends him a notification. he'd be like "who is this person screenshotting my story"

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Instagram doesn‚Äôt do that. There were rumors they were going to start, but never happened.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

if i had two phones i could take a picture of the other phone. that'd be sweet.
paranoia. paranoia all around.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

It was like "Dunkin, Starbucks, and Wawa all fucking  suck, black rifle coffee is the best"

Lmao Marisa I was just thinking I could do that on Tom's with mine üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*



eyyyyyyyyyyyyy

smart thinking

why he gotta be so offensive

the epitome of straight white alpha male behavior

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

I can hear how small his dick is from here.

Always compensating for something.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

He's the straight white alpha male poster child

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Yuuuup

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

i like how you can see meg's phone battery draining throughout her story

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Is this V?



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

that's him that's v

i can't believe V likes vocaloid

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

Can't believe V follows me

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

*You?*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

it's because she got his good ending

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

I got the follower.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

Yea? I thought he did, he did at one point at least

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

you can only follow one person at a time. it's law.

there's a bot that follows me and unfollows me every day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-29*

NVM maybe he unfollowed, or it was another V

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

I'm 2 away from 300 tho. I've been bouncing around 290s for awhile now, maybe it'll break.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

WOAH mr photo famous

what will you do when you reach 300

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

*snrk*

The "bill of the south" has over 1000.

~~I guess I'm the faker~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

is that you but evil

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

https://giphy.com/gifs/shadow-the-hedgehog-sonic-x-windiis-edits-11iuuKHFqILEU8

nah, some guy everyone who went to RTX met and did some photos with. Meg told me they called him the "Bill of the South" when he wasn't around.

~~hopefully that means they aren't going to replace me~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

fight your double

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Actually he gets about as many likes as I do on cosplay stuff.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

that means you have to cosplay more than he does

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

cosplay *photos*, not being in cosplay.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

that means you have to cosplay more than he does

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Nope.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-29*

**Bill** - *2018-08-29*

Lies

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

i thought dave didn't exist in the material realm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

His soul is in the phylactery but his body is not

**Dave** - *2018-08-30*

found my body, using it for the week

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

https://www.facebook.com/346366698707618/posts/2353179831359618/ I have to say, I‚Äôm really impressed that she made the post about the actions, not the person. No call out, no names, just a call to do better.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

so she's a dude on facebook but not instagram. makes sense.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Wow good on her

My ability to tolerate guys begging for my personal attention gets increasingly low as time goes on

Thankfully I don't get harassed too much? But frankly that guy messaging her is preetty creepy

Like? This guy is begging a random girl on the internet to do things to fulfill his own desires then that's highkey pathetic not gonna lie

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

Which is why the block button exists. It‚Äôs not her or anyone else‚Äôs job to teach perverts to be socially acceptable.

And thankfully indeed.

Tom is Rebecca's new photography icon

THE tomukuncosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

NICE

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-30*

YEAH

I was just saying that

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

~~I don‚Äôt even need boobs and he likes me~~

**Dave** - *2018-08-30*

The cheeks were a large enough substitute

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

So I got home and cut accidentally cut myself while putting away dishes and now I'm trying to see with a band-aid on my knuckle and it's so hard üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

I know you mean sew but damn if the typo isn‚Äôt funny. (Autocorrect always corrects sew to see)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

O opps

Yea I mean sew

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

I could guess from cosplay channel.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

Ignore the shitty lighting and the fact that I look dead

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

YEET!

I dunno what it is exactly but that feels so 2B!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-30*

The top was added and there's a mesh cutout

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

Ye!

I think this is much more in character this year

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

YEEE

I went back and looked, now I see it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

I didn't do the full patern cuz it wouldn't really fit right with the shape of the top, plus I was taking a chance doing cut out anyway but I think it turned out pretty good

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

Looks amazin.

and better err on the side of caution, lest the suit had been destroyed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-30*

Thank!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-31*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

What con were you Mia at?

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

That was fun.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

kogarafest? right?
~~i haven't cosplayed miia but if i cosplay a monster girl i wanna be bird girl~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

~~Mia~~
Nia

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

Throwback to Leanna V Marisa in the cosplay contest.

~~and then some dragon ball guy won~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

the guy who grew a tree from a young sapling to cut it down for the wood for his mega giant sword owo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

Look what happens when I Google kogara fest

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

cosplay contests are frustrating because people make GORGEOUS stuff and u know you can never compare to them <:rip:369476083248267274>

wot
omg twitter is where i got my picture too!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

Id never do a cosplay contest <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Fucc that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

at animenext's contest last year the person who won the novice category was in no way a novice, they were in college for costume design and everything and it was their job. they had the absolutely most beautiful costume, it was such a work of art. everyone was salty because they were like "it's *too* beautiful. that's craftsman level not novice" lol

tomu come enter the katsucon contest with me

bring jess

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

Yeah, the contests I‚Äôve seen there‚Äôs plenty of bias towards popular shows, or looking at the result rather than the work quality.

you need a wow factor.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

which ones? most are usually aimed at work quality but having a wow factor does help

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

Saikou, Kogara, kinda. All smol bois.

Glad to see we‚Äôre the only people to post photos from Kogara.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

i want to enter zenkai's but seeing as I chill out with most of the judges i'm most likely not eligible. if judges know the person being judged their vote doesn't count. 
i don't know about saikou but kogara was mainly visual ye

most contests are closed room and judges will ask to examine your costume. with permission of course but they'll go up and touch everything and flip your skirt up to make sure it's hemmed properly and check the seams.

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

If I remembered to tag my posts with con names we‚Äôd have all 9. Rip.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

you get between 5 and 10 minutes depending on how many people are competing to make a case for your costume and explain how ya made it

*time to post more*

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

*‚Äùthe runner up‚Äù dude sounds like a tool*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

he does have the poof sleeves tho
runner up could have totally been omitted ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

Sounds fine to me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

maybe just "here with lipstickgiraffe"

here with the squad

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

He's the training Gohan from the king Kai arc i think

I've never heard that called z sword but

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

i never realized until today but goku's voice is really weird in japanese

or was it gohan
whoever is in the new movie where everyone is fighting broly

no yeah it's goku why is his voice that

if i finish katarina in time for katsu i'm gonna enter her for the fun of it but katsu is insanely competitive so it'll mainly be to chat with people in line

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

Yeah it's goku

Goku and Luffy have really goofy original voices

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

why they do that

~~OH or if katarina is horrible I can redo the tails and trim on lucina~~

you can walk across the stage for like .2 seconds and gossip behind the scenes it's fun

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

*con gossip*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

mostly making bets on how many times uptown funk/gangnam style/despacito will be used in a masquerade skit

sometimes they give us finger sandwiches but it's rare

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-31*

the rare finger sammish

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

I think Gangnam style is too old now but

Maybe I underestimate the nerds

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

A foolish thing to do. 
[puts on fedora] *you have no idea what we‚Äôre capable of, normie* 
Anime fans grab your waifu pillows
Gamers grab your games

Tom your nerd side will have to fight the side of you that makes fun of nerds

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-31*

But that's so small

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

someone on reddit is asking about cosplay photoshoots in tokyo
they think the cost of using a cosplay studio includes costume rental and a photographer
oh you sweet summer child

in other news though studio crown now offers that for tourists. interesting. they used to host the international cosplay meetups so they probably got the idea from that. but that studio is suuuuuuuper tiny.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Whoooa that's cool

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

yee but they're really wringing tourists for everything they've got. $90 for 1 polaroid and 1 digital image in costume and wig, from a 5-10 minute photoshoot. or $150 for 6 pictures and makeup done by *real cosplayers*.

~~it's like katsucon pricing eyy~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

I should work on Yona but I made the mistake of playing the Nier soundtrack while sewing so now I wanna play Nier üò≠üò≠üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

*no* she would go kill a bear or something

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

You can kill a bear or something in Nier

Kinda

It's a boar is that close enough

They're both furry and start with B

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

~~its just a bathrobe~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

_im so unmotivated_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Like cosplay is just not being felt right now

I don't even wanna work on Lux or nothin

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

~~more like do it for Hak cause that's one nice piece of mans~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

ohh shiiiiiiitt

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

see see! this is a perfect example of the issues in costume contests at big cons

you have stuff like this in the novice division. notice this is *second place for novice* category.



second place craftsman division?

yes there's some serious skill involve and that todoroki costume is probably super impressive because craftsmen are intense but there's a huge imbalance

more pics of each:



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Yea that's a huge imbalance

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

novice is overly competitive and saturated with people while craftsman category is usually the same people, competing until they're offered a spot as a judge.

i'm gathering items i'll need to make stuff for katsu now so it'll all be ready when i'm back in the states
I think I know why this person bought clip-on earrings <:lenny:395307171539189760> ‚ù§

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

I was gonna spirit gum mine

oooo which  means I need to order spirit gum

Unless those have prime shipping üëÄ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

that's what i did for mine! go to Spirit Halloween store after halloween they sell it by the huge jug for dirt cheap
yeah those have prime shipping :3c

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Thank

MAWISA do you not have pierced ears too?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

no :0

AM I NOT ALONE

the orchestral version of the grill song from spongebob is playing in my head this is a joyous occasion

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

People always think I have pierced ears but I just never got them

And I don't care enough about earrings to get them now

~~except for cosplay~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

the things we do for cosplay
my sister has pierced ears which is odd because she's the most tomboyish person ever and as far as I know has never ever worn earrings. even during her first wedding, no earrings. my mother took her to get them pierced when she was really little so i wonder why I don't have them

maybe it's the jewish thing? mother is really strange about certain stuff.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

None of my sibling have pierced ears ü§î

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

clip-ons are really popular in japan, my friend said ear piercing is rare here

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

You don't do jewelry at all right Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Yeah I don't

I don't like it lol

Idk why I just never found appeal in it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

me too
this is getting scarily close to clone territory

jess do you wear jewelry

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Huh. I tried to imagine you with jewelry, it doesn't click. Which is odd, considering I like jewelry. (if you can't tell from my ring, watch, necklace...)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

do u need me to photoshop jewelry on anyone, o swag king?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Yea I wear jewelry I always wear my wedding and engagement ring obviously but I also wear necklaces, earings, rings, anklets etc depending on the occasion. Like I don't wear anything besides my ring on the daily but I like to wear jewelry when I like of it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

my preferred jewelry would be something silver and covered in spikes that I can tie to the end of my hair and whip around like a wrecking ball :3c
i usually keep a ring in the bottom of my bag somewhere but it's a self defense ring, one of those ones that look like a cat but that you can use to mess people up.

omg that's right married people have jewelry

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Yea, before we got married I wore a promise ring since 2011 so I'm used to it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

jess the ring expert

that's such a long time. your ring-wearing habit could attend elementary school.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Lols yea we've had rings for 7 years üò¨

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

7~~07~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

I wear a toe ring sometimes too but I know that's kinda weird

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

you could kick people with that

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Lol. I've had a class ring since 2010. I've got you beat. üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

biru has a senpai ring

doujinshi about tom and jess's rings and biru's ring at a school

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

It's not a competition tho

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Nah.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

are u sure

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

It's just amazing how long I've been wearing a class ring.

~~throwback to the campaign idea I had involving class rings and super powers~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

My class ring doesn't fit anymore

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

But yeah, especially since class rings aren‚Äôt popular.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

It was sized pre weight loss so it just falls off

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

High school right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

i don't know anyone at my school who got a ring

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Yea

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

I don‚Äôt know anyone who got a rowan one.

Jostens (the company that did tech‚Äôs rings) will resize it for free if you send it to them.

They‚Äôre a really good company.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

i wish they had decent video of that guy who juggled knives. i want to see that again.

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

I got mine modified to read Student council president rather than just student council.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Yea I know

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Just too much effort? üòÑ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

I just don't really care to wear it

I can fit it on my right pointer if I really wanna wear it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

A marriage ring is like a SUPER promise ring

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Yee, most people stop high school rings.

This has motivated to make my first Facebook post in like, a year.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

oh my god i was looking at the old male beauty pageant videos again and you can hear BoJo cracking up so loudly. we must've been near the camera i'm so embarassed.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-04*

HOTDOG

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-04*

if you say that you make a costume

that's how cosplay works

where can i buy a lot of garden hose for cheap

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-04*

prob amazon

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-04*

they all like $30 or more üò≠ and i'd need multiple hoses

anything cheaper looks too flimsy. hmm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-04*

First day of class, my Pyrrha pin disappears

The omens are not good with this one

**Bill** - *2018-09-04*

cosplay problems.
every single colored image of katarina's skirt has a different design. every single one. katarina pls.

**this art is so inconsistant**

her dress is different on all of the first three covers of the light novel
and in chapters 8/9 of the manga it seems to have gained an extra line on the front part for no reason

**Bill** - *2018-09-12*

Eh. If I did a kofi it would be for a newer flash. 

Even then, the only people to donate (if any) would be friends and I don‚Äôt want that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

uhhh animenyc for like a day, then katsu

~~technically ray, saeran and mc could be used for formal aswell but i think mawisa has plans for that already~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-12*

ooo anime nyc is a thing again???

ye i was considering ray for formal but i might do katarina for that

oh wow i didn't know anime nyc came back. bout time

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

yea the had it last year too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-12*

ooooooo is that what the voltron is for? owo

wait nvm i'm on the nycc page oops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

nahhh thats like a far off plan cuz friends wanna do a group

but they only go to like 2 cons a year

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-12*

animefest is still a thing? but i guess that's what anime nyc replaced? because animefest merged with nycc and it looks like now you can buy separate tickets that just get you into anime-ish stuff at nycc, like voltron and rwby. that's weird.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

üòÆ weird

<@!351785752197201920>  do you have black dress pants?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-12*

Just the adam ones

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

are they black? or patterned?

i cant remember

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-12*

Black

Or gray

Hmm

I think black

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

i think they are v. dark grey

~~you need a suit jacket anyway~~
~~we wouldn't have to buy another wig this way~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-12*

i could bring Jaehee but because it's a super simple costume i'd do her for a little on thursday ~~multiple thursday costumes eyyy~~

or a brief period some other day

my remilia wig and fangs are coming tomorrow. i'm going to cosplay her on the 23rd but I don't know to where because there are multiple cosplay events rip

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

D:

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-12*

Tokyo Game Show which i'm going to on the 22nd as Zelda, or Acosta which Rose is going to. remilia is from a game so both would be suitable

tgs would be more expensive because $10 entry and $10 cosplay fee, but it's way bigger

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

youve been to Acosta alot right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-12*

yee it's a monthly thing

so i know a few people who go. it's a good and bad thing (good because yay people i follow on twitter, bad because it's usually always the same people if that makes sense)

the south park yaoi girls will be at tgs but i don't know which day

**Bill** - *2018-09-12*

Anime New York Festival was the first thing, now it ANYC.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

id say TGS for new experience

**Bill** - *2018-09-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

WHOA

**Bill** - *2018-09-12*

Eh, I dunno Tomu.

Even if I did, I don‚Äôt think people would donate. I don‚Äôt get tips now, for example. (Except when Marisa stuff a dollar in my

Camera bag).

And as for goals, cosplay goals are like 100~200, photographer gear is minimum triple that.

At least where I‚Äôm at.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-12*

Yeah if wouldn't be for gear

Just an easy tipping service

MOOD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-15*

oooooo it seems literally *anything* disney is allowed to be cosplayed in the parks as long as it isn't marvel

also someone I know who's a metaton cosplayer got into the park in their giant metaton costume? not metaton EX but like. regular square metaton. howhy.

**Bill** - *2018-09-15*

I thought Disney had a strict no cosplay policy.

Also they look FANTASTIC holy crap.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-15*

usually yeah cosplay is 100% banned unless you're five.
tokyo disney parks have a special thing in september and october that when the halloween event is going on you're allowed to cosplay. disney characters only, and no mask, props, or excessive makeup

well, no big props

everybody come over and cosplay
https://www.tokyodisneyresort.jp/treasure/fantasy/halloween2018/dressup/rule_en.html

(that's in english despite the preview)

disney cosplayers don't mess around
~~that donald is the real donald but the toy stories are cosplayers~~

and they get super obscure too. every character from literally anything disney is fair game.

you have to always be fully covered, no strapless outfits and every shirt or dress must have sleeves, but some people manage to use witchcraft and find the perfect skin colored fabric

That's suggested friends, not mutuals

someone pls help me with guy makeup or i'll ruin ray and wind up looking like my really bad yuu cosplay again
i've been trying but each attempt is worse than the last

**Bill** - *2018-09-16*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-16*

biru spill the beans
what's your makeup routine

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-16*

Just do regular make up! Guys wanna be pretty too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-16*

noOo is too girly. impossibru.

i know guy makeup usually doesn't involve false eyelashes

maybe the stuff i use for contouring is too dark. but it works fine for girl characters aaaaaaa

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-16*

I think girls doing girl makeup minus the lashes make the best guy anime Bois üëå

Guy anime Bois< double the dude

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-16*

but the eyeliner would be too long and the contouring is too girly and *everything is wrong with the world nothing is just*

lips are easy you guy cover them up with skin colored makeup. maybe make them thinner if you're hardcore. but *cheeks.* the cheeks are what kill me.

and *eyes*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-16*

*justdontdoothemmmm‚ù§ *

**I do wings on my eyeliner excuse**

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

random cosplay tutorials on tumblr are hashtag blessed
i just found exactly what i needed on my dash

I order stuff online to send to the US in my name. I request the packages be left in a pile somewhere at home so they don‚Äôt get lost. 
BoJo takes them to the neighbors house and opens them there. BoJo why.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-18*

why tho?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-18*

Bojo whyyyy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-18*

I don‚Äôt know. She brought my last package to my sisters house too but didn‚Äôt open it until she got home, which is fine because at least I know which packages actually arrived. ü§∑

But like. What‚Äôs she gonna do if she‚Äôs at the neighbors and forgets a stack of bra inserts there. How‚Äôs she gonna explain that.

‚ÄúYes these are just my 300 small plastic Santas that I need for reasons, and which I opened at your house just because.‚Äù

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-18*

so she bring the package from home to your neighbors and opens it there instead of at home? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-18*

Yyyeahhh. Well mail doesn‚Äôt get delivered to our house, we have a communal mailbox in the middle of the neighborhood but our house is one of the closest to it. It‚Äôs like three big cages with 100 or so shoebox sized mailboxes on them. Our mail gets mixed up with the neighbors easily because of this. But it was delivered to the right place. 
I think she‚Äôs checking the mail as she leaves the house for some reason? Instead of as she comes home? And just takes the mail around on her daily stuff but the packages are too big to fit in her purse so she just carries them. Which makes less sense why she‚Äôd open them because then there‚Äôs a big hole that stuff (~~300 tiny plastic santas~~ ) could fall out of

The mailbox isn‚Äôt far at all though. It‚Äôs actually in between the parking lot and our house so it‚Äôd be on the way in.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-18*

ooo ok so its more like she was visiting them before going home kinda

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-18*

Yeah I think so. But then she went on a drive with them somewhere and she has work but she didn‚Äôt take her own car and she still has the open package.  ü§î

TLDR amazon needs to implement their drone system already

These aren‚Äôt amazon packages but still that would be cool

Biru and Andru have been to my development it‚Äôs trash town lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-18*

You‚Äôre not there when we have the exciting drug busts or when all the teenagers roaming around at midnight get rounded up by the police it‚Äôs very thrilling

Tho I think drug busts are a normal part of any neighborhood

Sometimes.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-18*

Tax dollars at good work

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-22*

I got this Instagram analytics tool that my sister showed me

It turns out that a majority of the time, when people ‚Äúunfollow‚Äù me, they actually just delete their account entirely

And to think, all this time I thought people unfollowed cause they didn‚Äôt like my content ü§î when in reality 60-70% just delete their IG

**Bill** - *2018-09-22*

Follower count still means nothing~~

I‚Äôm... also not sure that data can be extracted.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-22*

It just says who unfollowed me recently

And clicking on their username, if it no longer exists, it means they deleted

**Bill** - *2018-09-22*

Hmm. Maybe then. I‚Äôve looked at instagrams api, they‚Äôre really hard to get data out of.

The one guy posted on his Instagram it seemed he was having difficulty and he‚Äôs only using hairspray but for wigs like that u gotta make a spike base

Or have wax at least

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-24*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-25*

yeah hes really good

the photos came out awesome

hes got a very slow process but

frankly the back of camera preview for the pic he posted of me today was pretty ehhh

but he editted the lighting to be so much better

**Bill** - *2018-09-25*

*tape*
that's it that's what i'm missing for crossplay
that's the reason they sell it in every cosplay store and why i always see girls taping their faces. it's to make them look more masculine *that's the secret.*
it's too late for me to buy some for tomorrow ~~that's not horribly overpriced~~ but now i know for Ray i gotta get tape

*i have duct tape*

aaahhh i just sliced my neck. time to rest the cosplay.

found an old photoshoot that just consisted of me laying on the ground staring aimlessly up at the ceiling. bad photos but good times.

the power of tilt worm is strong

pre-cosplay ironing is finished, time to throw everything in a bag so it can get wrinkled in transport again. also threw together a makeshift binder i'm gonna sew to myself at 7 in the morning. <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-29*

üòÆüòÆüòÆ be careful! Who are you cosplaying?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

haine! i moved him up because i realized i have an expensive lecture to attend at school both days the girls festa is happening.

i could go the first day of the festa, but the lecture is at 2 and the event starts at 10. it takes about an hour to get to school from ikebukuro, and the changing room takes about an hour to go through, and then i'd have to change back into regular clothes so I would only be able to cosplay there for like an hour and a half to two hours before leaving which probably wouldn't be worth it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-29*

Oooo! Send pics! ~~Remember to drink water and try not run alot with your binder can attest that they hurt when they arnt good ones~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

~~lol, drink water~~
yeah i wish i had my actual binder. that was nice and comfortable. this one should be fine since it's just felt with elastic in the back. gonna be hot though with 5 layers of shirts.

it stinks because the lectures are all during cool events so i could either go to the game show or the girls festa, and i picked game show. how dare school.

i can still go walk around the festa

i had seven things on my legs (as in, pants/skirts/leggings) as remilia. the layer queen.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-29*

Ommggg plz don't die

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-30*

death in the name of crossdressing science

u know what i'm gonna be way too lazy and out of it to sew this in a timely manner so i'm gonna cut holes in the felt and just. tie the extra elastic around myself. yeah.

that's safe probably.

there we go it's basically a corset now

This costume has it all. Pants. Pockets. Swooshy coat. A dangly that occasionally jabs you in the eye. Manspreading is great I can see why guys do it.

Who did that I‚Äôm gonna beat them up

i was gonna cosplay mirai tomorrow but my confidence for her is shot now even after fixing the wig up a bit haha rip i'm gonna be saber instead

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-07*

What that fuck who says that

What's different than her hair? Looks the same to.me

I would have blocked them, damn how rude

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-07*

hibiju.cosplays says that <:lenny:395307171539189760>
i think my wig is too pink and not floofy enough but it was like $3 because i already have a ton of junk to take home and i don't want to invest in a proper wig that i'd have to mail back for the same cost as buying a new one. it's passable though, and in a lot of the art her hair is pink-pink.

i threw a ton of baby powder on it so it looks closer to her anime hair color but floof will be difficult to achieve without a hair dryer

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-07*

Yeah damn WHHHHHOOOOO SAYYYYS THATTTT

EVEN IF IT WAS WAY OFF

Which it's not

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-07*

i just finished ironing saber and washing her wig. it'll be better that way probably because non-japanese character at a japanese event.

omg I *think* this ticket comes with a free pass to ride all the rides in costume? Maybe? It says all-you-can-ride attractions but I dunno if that‚Äôs a title or if we can really ride everything for free but *saber on a merry go round*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-07*

iphone makeup apps are true magic

Low quality zoomed in pics 
Anime is real and precious

i especially appreciate when the ride was mainly full of regular people with like 1 or 2 cosplayers mixed in the middle or on the end. that's aesthetic.

Easy to setup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

i mean i feel bad about it cuz i have enough money to buy my stuff but i feel guilty spending so much money on cosplay at the same time

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Can't help you there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

wasnt asking for it, just explaining how i feel about it

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

I'm just sympathizing. I already agonized on it.

You might actually get money tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

yea but... im also not big on the reason that is

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

not following.

Also I feel like if you did a kofi goal you'd find it stressful that people now expect you to finish that cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

i feel like id gat money, but only cuz im a girl

and that feels dirty

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Ye, no, that's exactly it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

to me personally, like for alot people it makes sense cuz they dont have the money to fund their stuff so yea go for it but the combination of that and the whole "I can technically afford this" makes we feel weird about it

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Depends if you want to bank on there being real fans of yours who want to support your cosplay.

and to be fair, creeps are also cheap.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

I dont *need* to bank on it tho

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

I mean bet on the people who are supporting you are doing it to support you, not cause you woman.

As for not needing it...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

i mean... alot of people have them

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

I don't either?

I opened it to give anyone who wanted to do something to show their support the option.

and the extra income is supportive, every dollar counts to a cosplay.

So it's a real way to help you without like, people *actually trying* to help you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

hmmm true ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

If you're comfortable with that...

Then you have to rectify that there may be a few people who support you cause you purty.

But that's the same with follows. Some of them are there for swimsuits, others for you as human.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

lol i already amuse no one follows me cuz im human, sept the ones that are real friends

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Nah, there are people who follow for content.

~~why do you think I have 300 followers~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

i ALSO dont want my friends buying me ko-fis when they could be working toward their own goals

content= tit

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Yeah, just growl at your friends not to.

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

So those, lets say 150 I've never met, content followers.

Ko-fi wars: who can spend the most on other people?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

Couldn't we get a friggin break.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-09*

It's got nothing to do with us

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-09*

~~One of them is instigating and my money is on snow~~

But yeah realistically it has nothing to do with me, I know nothing and it's none of my business

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

Mm. But Snow is in BNE which has only a step or two removed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-09*

Yea but there's nothing I can do about it so im not going to stress myself over it

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

true. I just feel the need to be on guard.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

No, it good

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-10*

uguu i forgot i wanted to cosplay elizabeth. that'd be perfect for katsu but i don't want to bother with more than 2/3 new costumes in less than a month. maybe for zenkai.

post katsu progress plans

look wot i found in the katsu tag

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-10*

one of my midterms is electromagnetism today

_i must be blessed by this picture_

**Bill** - *2018-10-10*

Mm!

I wanna do David‚Äôs SfS cause he‚Äôs a bean and I like him. But I hate share for shares.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-10*

All the old cosplay pics is the cute üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-10*

congratulations georgia for your child

**Dave** - *2018-10-10*

Do it for me

**Bill** - *2018-10-10*

If Dave does a share for share I‚Äôll do it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-10*

dave vs david showdown

**Bill** - *2018-10-10*

Knowing about Casey and Jake makes her doing the announcements for his cutters so much more amusing.

**Dave** - *2018-10-10*

I don't do things

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

Since <@245270932602486784>  put up her katsu line up I'm trying to think of mine? Not sure if I'm feeling rwby üòÆ I do wanna show off my hammer tho ü§î

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

Jess with a Hammer

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Well, if you guys are doing Nier I'd want to get a shoot in with all three of you.

and maybe get Leanna as well.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

as 2b?

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

No, as Adam.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

look butt face you dont have to be sarcastic

should I maximize for friend coordination

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Yes, 2B and 9S.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

*ooooooooo* shots fired

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Do you want to do shoots/events with friends? Or do you want to show off your own thing, get hall shots, or generally wander?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

((biru when i decide on a 90% finalized schedule lemme know if u have any interest in shooting any characters because i'll likely start scouting for photogs asap))

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

ALL

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

that might murder him

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

~~9 costumes for just Marisa is a lofty goal~~

Remember that Marisa is *insane* at cons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

no i mean i wanna do all those things

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

anything i pay for won't be more than 30 minutes, most will probably be 15, but i'd also be willing to pay for any shoots you do

YEAH JESS WANDERING AROUND WITH A HAMMER BEING MAJESTIC

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Will do tho. I'm pretty sure I'm going to fail at 'taking it easy' at Katsu. I may *despise* the crowds and general atmosphere of Katsu, butttt I want to do photos cause it's fun.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

wander wander, pose, wander to a photoshoot and be the star of a gathering. that's jess's schedule.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

i want photoshoots but i dont know any photogs and i dont wanna drop mad cash and im awkward with new people, and i dont have a line up

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

*cough*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

i know some photogs but i think the ones i'm most familiar with are mostly dormant or retired now.
<:lenny:395307171539189760>
gee if only there was one still active with reasonable rates

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Figure out your line up first.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

you just said u wanna take is easy thooooo

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Oh and nice of you to offer Marisa but you know I'm not going to ask you for money right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

jess i pretend to be a photog i can take ur picture

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

YAY

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

~~Exclusive Whoozica cosplay photographer tlt_wm~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

we have us a fancy photoshoot
i will pay. if not with cash then with stuff.

u wanna see my bad portfolio. i've been meaning to add to it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

i know rebecca too, am comfortable with her

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

We'll see what I do.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

imma do that now while eating my donburi

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Like if no one's really doing RWBY I'm not going to bother with the Hazel thing. I don't personally care that much, it just felt like it'd be fun to do it with everyone.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

i wanna do rayla but im afraid there will be 900 raylas

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Be like, Callum. No one will be Callum.

Also fuck other people, do the cosplays you want to do.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

hell no XD

ill just put rayla and 2b in the same day so i can be basic the whole day

ill do Nora and Mina so i can be crazy one day, and then Rayla and 2b so i can feel inferior all day, and MM whenever lol

also i can only wear 2b for like an hour before her shoes kills me rest in peace me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

you gonna body paint your face for mina? body paint stuff is usually best for at the end of a day and/or last day of a con

photobucket is so horrible omg i knew it's awful but now it's just. utterly atrocious.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

üòÆ i was def gonna do her on the tail end of a day at least

OH WAIT

<@!184437198865563648>  were staying sunday night right?

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

It's booked yeah.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

are we?? :0 so thursday through monday?

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

We have two rooms thursday through monday.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

woaaaaaah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

OOOOOOOOOOOOOO I CAN PLAN MORE COSTUMES THEN

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

that sounds so weird

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Last year we decided to stay through monday (at a different hotel) so we didn't have to drive up after the exhausting Katsu.

I have that monday off from work too, so it's a neat thing.

Now we have the sunday night in the gaylord so we don't have to fight the elevators.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

really? :0
I know a bunch of people do it. i've gone down on wednesdays. or even tuesdays for otakon to help set stuff up.
it's just gonna be so weird being at the con but *no con*

probably lots of staff lingering though. about 60% of zenkai's staff stays for free until monday

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

~~when all the people leave I might actually be willing to go to the fucking gazebo~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

and ill still have my staging area, so i dont have to worry about going tot he car and stuff

YEA GAZEBO

whooooo

from the preliminary talk yesterday, it seems like alot of friends are doing bnha friday?

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Yeah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

the photoshoots seems like a mess tho, like multiple each day idk

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

my sd card of the last few cosplay events is corrupted rip
time to back up what files i have left on that card

is there any good free online storage that's bigger than google drive or dropbox

are there multiple bnha gatherings each day? wot

oh. google drive offers 100gb for $2 a month though. that's tempting.

rowan e-mail has unlimited free storage. *dumps all my cosplay photos there.*

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Flickr.

Flickr gives you a terabyte of photo storage.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

but that's public isn't it

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

They have private galleries.

It's album setting.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

like i searched the events at katsu on FB and got like so many bnha results i dont know whick is da truu one

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

BNHA is the hip thing so everyone and their mom will be running something,

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

marisa asked if there were multiple gatherings i was just answering her question

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

thank

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

the one at 12:30 on friday seems popular

oof how long does body paint last

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

depends! can last all day.

sometimes i'd be picking grey off my hairline for several days.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

ooo ok cuz if there is like a pj party later i might want it on from like noon till after a pj part if there is one

hi my names jess i like the stress about everything

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

oh hey i have a portfolio on flickr lol

good job past me

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Early is really the only time to shoot indoors though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

i dont actually have a hard time walking up earlier at a con, if im not the only one doing it, i have more a hard time getting moving tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

is anything in this album visible
https://www.flickr.com/gp/149364684@N02/42p57K

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

disappointed my sd card conked out and i lost everything recent

o dis one of my faves from 2 katsus ago
https://www.flickr.com/gp/149364684@N02/y35U11

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

You want that to be your portfolio Marisa?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

it's all i have probably

everything is scattered on hundreds of memory cards and sticks and old computers from over the years

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

i like dem

i like the ryoko one das neat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

thank but i must improve. gotta bop bop bop bop to the top
o ye that was a weird shoot because they kept telling me what to do and what they wanted to do was always opposite of what was best for the camera <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

*I HAD THAT HAPPEN*

Fucking Chameleon whatever at Katsu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

omg what were they cosplaying. what stuff did they make you do.

like, "take my picture right here where it's half shady and half sunny." or "point your camera *at the sun*"

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Eh, it was Katsu and I was already so shot from the crowds I gave up and took the crappy ones, suggested a few good ones, gave her the good ones.

For a portfolio you don't need so many images. I'd say pick the top 9.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

also this merida like. never gave me her contact info. we spoke through tumblr i think? yeah. and this was before the messaging system existed so I asked her "where do you want me to send these pics?"
I asked a couple times and tagged her in a post in case the asks weren't going through. no responses ever.

gotta use **all the pics**

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Marisa, I return 20~30 images most shoots.

I take close to 100 at most of those shoots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

mina has comfy shoes big plus ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

~~I'm already over a month behind on everything in my backlog, can you image?~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

me too tho. i promise at least 20 pics back per shoot. i take about 4k to 5k at a casual con. the photog struggle.

behind on backlog? **take more photos**

look it's tom and jess

tfw u try to make a post and it ain't posting

rip

there it go <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

and if you're still storing photos on sd cards get them off sd cards. Sd cards are super unreliable.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

my life is sd cards

can you have sub-albums in flickr. probably not

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Get an external hard drive (flash drives are too small IMO, but if it works it works).

And I think Flickr would work well for you, even to store the stuff you get back.

no you can't.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

my flash drives all cop out too because they're the super cheap ones hehe

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

you can create collections of albums.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

yeah storing stuff is what i primarily need. i don't want to lose the photos i've paid for.

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

flickr.

*get your photos somewhere safe or so help me*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

can u not upload images directly to an album. uguuu this sucks

*uuuuuuuugh*

o got it

i look so bad in so many pics ; u ;

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Hush.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

nance gave me this because i "look cute" but i am ready to devour souls

akko needs major improvements

biru do u wanna shoot jess and i's (and tom's? is he unknowning) mystic mess

OH I CAN DO JAEHEE WHILE WORKING AT ZENKAI

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

YEA

im thinking either well all be saeran or ill be mc, and he can be be suit boi

which would u perfer?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

either is fine!! it'd be awesome to have an MC and then super cool to have suit boy. seven could work too but i can't see as many picture possibilities for seven/ray route ray and saeran.

triple baka JUST came up in my playlist though. just now. that is a sign.

ah fudge. i sort my folders by character and then by photog. flickr doesn't have good ways to organize that hnnng

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

mmkay ill see if tom is willing to be suit saebae and ill be ray route mc ~~and you guys can fight over me~~

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

I'd say see if you can get Georgia to do MC again, but I doubt she'd have time. *maybe* sunday?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

i see, georgias a better MC üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

alternative option: i'll dress as MC and we can do a 3 person MC shoot

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-11*

Baka baka baka

***aggressive cellphoning***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

thomas! are u ok with being suit saeran, so i can be MC? or do u wanna be unkown real bad

i think the pics will be pretty co either way

<@!351785752197201920>  come bacccckkk

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

if we stay until monday does that mean we can bring monday costumes <:lenny:395307171539189760>

or is monday a no-cosplay day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

def a no cosplay day XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

*cosplays jaehee on monday because it's super casual*

i'm making one flickr album just called "mistakes" for the worst of my worst costumes

i loathe the pics but i paid like $40 for them

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

No Jess, so you can get more Mystic Messenger characters in at once, duuuuh.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-11*

Doesn't matter to me babe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

WHOOO now you can be EVEN EDGIER

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

oof. one of my faves raised her photography prices. my kokoro.

though her otakon ones were way more expensive than other cons?

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

who?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

Depth of Light. she did my neon and my selkie shoots

eyein' her up for katsu. these were her rates last year which aren't bad

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Yeah, they good.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

fudge. i can't find the girl who did my katara pictures. those were great too.
depth of light has really nice work and she made sure i didn't skate into traffic or down a flight of stairs as neon

GOTEM they changed their name but they've been on hiatus from cons since 2015 oops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-11*

oh noooo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

i do not recommend sumiko photo at all. at least i had a horrible experience with them but i know they're big in the cosplay community.

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Rebecca knows her.

I'm blanket unimpressed with the work.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

maybe it was just bad timing. the guy doing the pictures was exhausted (it was a duo or a trio? they were so overbooked. i had a guy taking my pics) and he hadn't had a break all day and it was night.

my cosplay also sucked *but*

just a combination of me being awful and an exhausted photog with no light

all the pics basically look like this lol it's a horror shoot

emcp is a creep but he did take good photos

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

Yeah... I don't think she flatters rebecca in her photos.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

munchkin photo was nice but very blunt lol. she said i was chubby and had to suck in my gut hehe

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-11*

Marisa if you matchin up at any point with me I‚Äôll do ALL the photos with you üíï

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

YEAH it would be an honor to take photos of / be in photos with the honorable state of Georgia

There is way too much going on today.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

put it all down and throw it out the window *it's time to talk about cosplay that won't happen for ages*

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

i still have scars from comiket but i added some makeup to my amazon cart so i can cover em up if needed

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

why do you have scars.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

from cosplaying

üëç

**Bill** - *2018-10-11*

*Marisa*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-11*

~~Hunter continues to annoy me about shoots and such~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

y tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

weren't u interested in the photo convention thing

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

‚ÄúYou can keep them Bill‚Äù

Excuse.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

whaaaa where was that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

yeawhere was that i def missed that

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

are u passing up a boudoir shoot smh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-12*

But why tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

he just kidding around

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

He probably is. But I didn‚Äôt find it funny.

The attitude he has bugs me; Plus aforementioned fear everyone will work with him and I‚Äôll lose my spot in BNE, he‚Äôs being kinda pushy with shooting (but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that I suppose), and a bit of jealousy people are jumping on his shooting suggestions.

Idk. It rubs me the wrong way.

It doesn‚Äôt actually matter I guess.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-12*

Nono

I'm asking why it's annoying

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

the attitude? i think hes just really passionate about shooting.  i think you are making it a competition when it isn't

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

ye, never fear. is he located closer to people? maybe their schedules are more convenient?

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Why? I thought those were why.

He‚Äôs a student so has more time. I dunno. Feels like people are more willing to work with him (but he‚Äôs asking for people so that could be it). It‚Äôs not about the shooting itself... definitely more of the social implication.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

i don't think people seem any more willing to work with him than they do you. i'm only looking at stuff from 10am onwards so i could be missing a ton of context but it just seems like they suggested an idea and a couple of people were bouncing off that idea.

oh golly i wish they used a folder or online link for those photos ; u ;

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Yeaaaaah

Oof I‚Äôm already annoyed, if I try and suggest it it‚Äôll definitely come off passive aggressive.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

why would a photo channel be bad? u could show off more too

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I post gallery links. Every photo doesn‚Äôt need to posted directly to discord.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

a photo channel could be nice for links too. if you're worried about the number of channels then one could be deleted, like mystic mess. private channels in a big discord worry me.

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

It‚Äôs not my call. I just hate excessive channels.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

it has about the same as aurii

im not in any other servers so i cant really compare tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

beef has channels just for saying the word 'beef' and for copypastas. i'm in a few servers ~~though 100% inactive~~ and aurri/bne probably have less channels combined than any other server

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

You don‚Äôt know how to navigate after a certain point. And I meant what I said that a server should have lots of conversation about something to warrant the channel first.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

i hate excessive channels too, i would say just post them in announcements like normal

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

We started cons because we flooded General with con talk way back when.

Not if he intends to post *every single image individually*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

i mean we dont use announcements that much

idk i didnt want the animals channel but majority wins

hes kind of a pushy guy, and a little awkward about it

not a bad person but pushy

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

THANK YOU

Exact kind of channel that‚Äôs just useless space.

The pushiness is getting to me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

He has good intentions

He‚Äôs excited to not feel lonely for the first time in a while

The people he used to shoot with live in VIRGINIA

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I know. I don‚Äôt hate him for it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

out of context quotes is a good and fun idea but it's not used very often, wouldn't a photo channel be similar? (i don't wanna start drama hh and i don't mean this as a fighting thing i just think a photo channel would be convenient but i'm not murdering to have one)
the animals chat was unnecessary yeah but it seems popular.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Idk I get it

Like when meg suggested formal Pyrrha I had a pang of like ‚Äúbut I do that‚Äù until I backtracked and was like lol fuck it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

i think we could get rid of some lesser used channels

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

~~You wanna do formal photos~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

I wanT A FORMAL JAUNE THAT DOESNT FORGET HIS S H O E S

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Moot point, I know how busy you are and respect that. I expect you‚Äôll tell me when you‚Äôre able to do shoots.

Hehe.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Yeah October is shot

Which makes me nervous cause I wanna shoot with Casey before ethan steals her five ever

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

my jaune wasn't allowed into the ball because of his shoes lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Hals dress was too short one time so he had to change so he was late, he had an emotional fit the next time so he was late, he forgot his shoes another time so he was late

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

oof that dress code

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

He‚Äôs a scatterbrain, through and through

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Yup.

He really sucked at showing up on time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Idk the fact that meg is pretty and funny and party girl and also cosplays Pyrrha rubs me the wrong way when I‚Äôm having a bad day

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

~~No excuse for Katsu imo~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

But if I check myself it‚Äôs whatever

Idk what happened at Katsu tbh

He just had some kinda mood

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

* also pretty and funny. You are as well.

He was in a mood all *weekend*, the formal was excessive.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

~~all of y'alls cosplay makes me feel like a horrible failure and i always feel far out of the loop because y'all are doing cool stuffs together but also i'm really happy for y'all and want to see more because y'all amazing~~
~~I think your pyrrha is better than meg's because u work on that wig stylin'~~

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

WE LOVE YOU AND AS SOON AS YOU COME HOME YOU'LL BE A PART OF ALL THOSE PLANS

COME HOME NOW THAT WORKS FOR ME.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

MAWISA NOOOO WE MISS YOU SO MUCH

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

i can be the ugly one that makes everyone else look better <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

~~that's me~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

ok but since we all voicing insecurities tonight

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

*sucks Marisa into hug like a black hole*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

~~i feel sad that everyone seems to react more to eriks are then mine in the inktober channel~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

YEAH i noticed his were really oddly popular but urs are gorgeous
maybe because they shippy pictures?

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

BNE is obsessed with all the BNHA stuff right now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

ye but i post deku the other day and got NOTHIN

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

kinda dicouraged me that why i feel a day behind

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I admit, I've been marking the channel as read for the last few days.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

***it's precious***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

yea i mean it fine ~~i just crave validation cuz im v. insecure about my art~~

TANK MAWISA üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

we're gonna hold a private art gallery for jess with mini sandwiches served on trays by roaming waiters where everyone can admire her work and a fantabulous glamour shoot for georgia with fancy falling flowers and exquisite backdrops

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Yeah I haven‚Äôt looked at inktober tbh

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I just haven't been paying attention ~~mostly cause Hal Meg and Erik won't stop with the BNHA~~ but I'll look more.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

oh no thats terrible do not do that

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I did encourage you from the start, I shouldn't crap out on you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Yeee we will pay more attention now üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

na, im not blaming you guys it just something ive been hyper paying attention too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Tbh hal sayin he needs more content made me laugh

Cause I was the one who encouraged him to GET content

Now he‚Äôs gotta do it on his own

And he‚Äôs like fuck I have nothing to post

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

hubris

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Like he'll remember to post it anyway.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

[takes a picture of him saying he needs more content] [captions it 'the downfall of mankind']

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

LMAO

yeah he‚Äôs not a poster

Idk stuff I used to find endearing is like annoying now

Love is ROSE COLORED GLASSES YALL

Don‚Äôt do love it‚Äôs a drug

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

>.>

~~can't even deny it~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

why love real people when anime exists

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Mood

Brb marrying 2B

I‚Äôm actually playing Nier as like a 20 min destressor and my suitemate was like ‚Äúis this kingdom hearts?‚Äù

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

"yes"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

ANYWAYS yeah we all got some salt with BNE I think right now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

na i not salty, just insecure.

i feel like some people get more attention than others but im not that entertaining so is ok

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

~~meg always gets attention~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

i kind of agree. i feel like most of the things i post there get ignored by anyone outside aurii, but then again i post novels.

how long did people know each other irl before bne?

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

It's not a close knit server, despite the fact we treat it that way.

It's technically a what, acquaintance level server. Everyone's met in person and knows each other's names, but it's on the level of like, an anime club.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

~~i also have the bad habit of changing topics during discussions sorry~~

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I wouldn't invite everyone in an anime club to my house.

Never change Mawisa.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

that sounds like one of those 90s safety ads
"you wouldn't invite an *anime club* to your house."

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

That it's a 'club' server is why I've considered inviting Erik and Leanna to our server eventually.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

"you wouldnt download a car"
fuck yea i would

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

This is a server for people I've vetted and trust.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Me, partway through inviting them all to my house: y-yeah

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I'm starting to get a good feeling with those two.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

this server better be quality what with the insane fee i pay every month to access it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

BTW thanks bill for saying you‚Äôll be at my house the last weekend in October

Without publicizing the party

Very discreet, much appreciated

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

great minds.

I was about to say in regards to your Me: post:

Yeaaaaah, so I always was bothered on your behalf when Rei would invite the server to your house. It's not Rei's right, and you have the right to vet who can come to things.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

I mean I invited almost everyone

Not hal cause obviously

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

This was back for the first time you did something.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

omg someone would invite people to your house??

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

I‚Äôve given up on meg and Lissy cause I‚Äôve invited them like three times to things and got no reply each time

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Maybe cosplay workshop.

Like, just the action of Rei inviting people without consulting you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Eh

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I *hate* that when it happens to me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

Rei is the type to just follow after my successes I think

Not gonna lie it‚Äôs always been that way

I didn‚Äôt invite ryan this time around either cause he hasn‚Äôt made the last few events :/

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

If you're okay with that, it's fine, that's basically what I assumed... But since we were talking about it I always felt that way.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

is there a train from south jersey to north jersey

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

No. =/

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

I never got my Marisa letter üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

ye. it used to be fine and everything would show up great. but i don't think any of the stuff i sent to georgia's po box arrived, and i mailed 4 letters at once one day (tom's birthday card which I don't think he got? and letters to my mother, my sister, and then my aunt and uncle who were the only ones to get theirs.)

YEAH SEE

THIS IS POSTAL THEFT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

what if someone invited people over to your dorm room without asking. then you could tell your roommate like "idk i didn't invite them so it's not my fault"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-12*

She hasn‚Äôt been here the last three nights! Not tonight either!

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I wanna meet Scott. I like everything I‚Äôve seen about him.

Seems like a stand up guy.

~~morbidly curious how many of the people are using photos I did~~ Not that it matters too much, I care that *you* like them, but I had the thought.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-13*

A big chunk are using this photo



But otherwise it‚Äôs a smattering of things

I have also gained 11 followers since this morning

4K by the end of October seems within reach lol

**Bill** - *2018-10-13*

Unsurprising... Ben seems to be conventionally popular.

~~I label those Tom is the only Ren cosplayer~~

That's actually not true I guess Etahn is one but HES NOT IN THAT GROUP SO WOOPS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-15*

truths

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-15*

Guys I was upset about them doing JNP shoots yesterday but then Bill reminded me that we have you two perfect human beings and I actually felt better

That‚Äôs some gay shit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-15*

‚ù§

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-15*

Daw thank

But yeah, I knew you would be, I saw the pictures and was like. Oh well that's rude

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-15*

Ikr??? Like ok thanks

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-15*

yea üò¶

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-15*

Like it‚Äôs not like I own Arkos but that‚Äôs obviously something Hal and I used to do

I wonder if he‚Äôs being petty on purpose but I assume not

He‚Äôs not the petty type usually

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-15*

i dont think hes being petty, i just dont think hes paying any mind to it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-15*

They only got JNP

_one ups them by getting full JNPR_

**Bill** - *2018-10-15*

Not that you have a Jaune.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-16*

What‚Äôs up with the Arabic caption on the one photo that Hal added? ü§î is he practicing for a test maybe

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-16*

idk how well he knows arabic i only know that he knows it to some degree

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-16*

ye it just seemed a bit strange to have an arabic caption over the image he posted. for artsy purposes?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-16*

(prob)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

I guess? I thought it was odd too

Also üò¶ his friend Jordan unfollowed me

Aquacosplay?

Shame, I liked her

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-16*

Aww that‚Äôs not cool of her

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-16*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-16*

Also your hammer is full hammer form (not that that matters all that much) <:lenny:395307171539189760> otherwise I'd love to

~~There are some abandoned trains by Dover train station~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-16*

First sign of snow let's do it

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-16*

Did you a *spin*?

We gonna try for a video?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

YE

it will probably end terribly

i actually have motivation to cosplay to the premiere now if we go, although i dont really wanna spend $13.00 to watch something for like less than 30 mins but whatever

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

~~you were already spending that~~

and I mean, yeah, it's bullshit they show the old episodes first, but.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

not if i didnt go

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

*you were going to not go?* ;-;

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

i dont think i bought my ticket yet now that you mention it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

i wasnt sure yet honestly its in the middle of the week and its expensive for what it is

wait is it 25 or 26th?

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

thursday.

25th.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

and where were we planing on going?

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

Rockaway.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

ill prob do it if its rockaway

<@!245270932602486784>  are you seeing it with us, or by you?

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

I mean, we also told Leanna two months ago we'd be going to see it so...

Georgia was coming by us.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

ye ill be by yall

so we cAN GET CHILIS AFTER WOWEE

:V

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

mmkay

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

Probably won't do chilis.

We do red robin or wild wings after movies, cause we usually have work next day.

As you have class.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

hence the :V face

**Bill** - *2018-10-16*

Yeah, I'm never going to assume you're joking about Chilis.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

we could possibly do some pics after since well all be together and in cosplay already (if toms up for it)

dunno where tho cuz itll be dark rip

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

are we doing full or casual?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

what were yopu thinkin?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

my last class ends at 4:30 so I prob dont have time to suit up into full Pyrrha

Weiss is just my normal make up taken a step further tho so i could suit up into her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

im fine with either

plus sitting in a movie in full pyrrha is not comfy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

tru facts lol

i say we casual it up then

especially if were eating somewhere affter

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*

we could do casual, i dont have alot of pink stuff tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-16*
