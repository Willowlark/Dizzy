**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-09-25*

can this be the spot where we share convention stories or is this more for organization/collaboration?
because i wanna hear some convention stories but I don't know if they can be locally sourced from here or if I have to find other channels to properly outsource some con stories.

**Bill** - *2017-09-25*

It can be whatever it needs to be.

Hair was on point, medical coat, the works.

**Andrew** - *2017-09-25*

Doctors exist in real life you know

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*



**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

not a gif.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

ya it wouldn't let me upload a gif so I spent like 40 seconds searching for the most ideal .png

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

failure.

FYI there's a stickers hack you can install. It's a bit technically and requires you to use the desktop client (which is stupid and won't let you resize it horizontally anymore) but you get weeb stickers.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

these are some of the ones the mafia chat uses

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

https://github.com/Pitu/Magane

No like, sticker stickers. Not emoji.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*



**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

https://github.com/awaken1ng/bd-linestickers

Even more advanced, but I think that'll let you use any sticker pack available on LINE.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

somebody help him

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

Yeah, you gotta do the technical ones. The bot version requires you to install each sticker manually and I don't have time for that shit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

we can stick to reaction images like barbarians

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

How to host panels, photoshoots, and fandom events huzzah

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

\( Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü)/ Huzzah!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-11*

Because there's a lot of WEEBS that don't know how to run photoshoots and it hurts my soul

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

(Flashback to the time a shoot organizer was so in the zone and focused on running the shoot that they yelled at the con chair to not block the area) (and then realized later it was the con chair) (beautiful)

Also that one time the shoot organizers never showed up so I impromptu ran it

also shoutout to that undertale photoshoot in the smallest back corner of a hallway right when undertale was at peak popularity. impossible photoshoot.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-11*

Ooof

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

ah yes. metrocon's "Girls Only" panel run by a guy who tried surveying the girls on their preferred lover and argued with them over their choices, and then got shut down in 10 minutes.

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

Who was I telling about that story...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

hopefully everyone because it's gold

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

you told me about it during the boudoir photography panel XD

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-11*

wow impressive

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

did you actually go to that panel?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

the girls only? I didn't but I was reading the storm of complaints about it in live time afterwards

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

ohhh ok thats probably good haha what a creep, how did that even get approved?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

i think someone wrote an article about that brb

yesss
https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/08/06/metrocon-op-girls-panel-approved/

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

omg yes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

you can read the description of the panel in that picture too

last year at a convention staff meeting one of our new members requested if they could run a panel with like all of the voice actors we invited, that would be 2 hours long of him talking about Cowboy Bebop. they denied him. tragic.

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

sad.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

you wanted to go that panel billy?

XD

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

the metrocon one or the voice actors being talked at by some dude?

Cause neither.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

was this girls only panel and 18+? like the fact that is said girls only and was run by a dude should have been pretty suspicious

lmao jk

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

ik

also super sketchy sounding from the start.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

i don't think so it was the middle of the day
he had posters that he hung around the con to advertise it in big sparkly glitter paint with peace signs and stuff from a lisa frank sticker set



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

wtfffffff

so sketchhyyyyyyy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

wooooowww

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

con staff outfits*

whatever you wanna call em

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

the entire con staff was wearing kilts.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

thats awesome!

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

eeeeeeh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

i like kilts leave me alone üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-11*

lmao fantastic, and yeah the text pm said what he was gonna do

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

story i've told ten billion times because it's a favorite among our security team: there was a convention with a glass staircase, and they had a problem with a photographer camping out under the glass stairs and taking upskirt pictures every time girls went up the stairs. they had a guy on staff who wore a kilt the traditional way (nothing on under it) so they sent the kilt staffer to patrol up and down the stairs. upskirt photographer stopped taking pictures.

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

Sassy staff.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

there's a guy on youtube who was taping girls inappropriately at otakon and the end is him complaining about how staff took his badge and kicked him out of the con unfairly.
like, you uploaded a video with all the reasons they kicked you out. the evidence is all right there.

i live for con drama if you have stories pls share

as in i live to hear about con drama third-hand

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-11*

Lmao traditional kilt guy is a hero

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

*Duct. Tape. Umbreon.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-11*

OH MYGOS

Compare contrast: is that him?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-11*

Omg

Maybe?

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

It's old *Jaune who wants to do every  Jaune ship as the sole Jaune at the shoot*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-11*

OOOOOOH

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

From the first kotori I had my camera for.

I think it might be him.

That shoot had the sassiest Qrow tho.

Last one promise. Relevant to **someone** here.

It's Marisa.

Hint hint.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

Screams

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

From many moons ago.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

The time I couldn't find my ruby boots so I remade them that morning using a pair of stilettos
Stiletto Ruby

Then I found them the next day doing something totally unrelated

**Bill** - *2017-10-11*

Lady stilts.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-11*

**Bill** - *2017-10-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-12*

Ooooooo really? Fascinating
The other guy who was banned that I unfriended on Facebook followed me for a bit during otakon. I now see why they might be banned.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-12*

I'm laughing I have a picture of andru before I met him too

Explains how everybody who's been going to cons for a while knows each other

**Bill** - *2017-10-12*

Was that that before you met him?

**Andrew** - *2017-10-12*

It was before I met any of yous

**Bill** - *2017-10-12*

In another universe, Georgia became friends with us years ago.

**Andrew** - *2017-10-12*

Like, anyone at rowan

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-12*

Yeah I was either still in high school or that was my first year of college, if it was the latter it would be another few weeks before meeting y'all

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-12*

Omg I was still in high skool

**Andrew** - *2017-10-12*

My friend was Naruto and the other Tobi and me kirito

Just justin

**Bill** - *2017-10-12*

üòõ

That wasn't too far after I met John

**Bill** - *2017-10-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-12*

Where can we get Christmas outfits gosh dang

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

I got the one I used last year at https://www.aliexpress.com/ (it's where i buy any cosplays i buy online)
I just search stuff like "santa dress" "christmas dress" "christmas cosplay" "santa cosplay" etc and start wading through the search
amazon and ebay might also have somethin'

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Should we do matching Santa dresses?

Or like I could be like a white mom and have the white collared shirt under a holiday sweater LOL

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

That's a winter thing.

Why does Gen have to be in stupid florida.

(After thought, maybe inviting Rob himself isn't a bad idea. It's not like we only like them together.)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

I was looking for something to replace ruby's main outfit (red instead of black) but keep the boots/leggings/cape/waist piece, but matching dresses would be neato too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

I'm pretty sure they live far away

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

make them drive up from florida

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

_marisa no_

Well we could do matching dresses and the accessorize them based on our characters

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Rob's in jersey I think. In *whatwouldbecentralifcentralexisted*.

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

I didn't say want. You were the one considering it~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

If need be I can switch to Yang because it's always the Yang or Weiss that's missing

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-15*

Lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

BUT I LIKE WEISS so that's cool too lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-15*

Thx for the no preview

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

hey. random curiosity for no reason in particular whatsoever. 
How much is the admission for cosplay ice skating and how long is it? is it an all day thing

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

it'll help if you @ mention <@!245270932602486784> .

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

O I think I found it. $8 for 2 and a half hours?

My friend from high work was advertising their skating rink and what if cosplay skating. Hmm.

I went to one before but only me and the hosts showed up eyy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

What's up

Oh cosplay ice skating isn't announced yet as far as I saw but it's 10 I think for rental and admission

2 hours

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

ohoho

thank

"friend from high work"
high school rip

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Oh wait it was 8 dollars I found the event

And it was 2 and 1/2 hours but no one got on the ice til 4



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

gotcha gotcha

there's a skating rink (rollerskating) around here that seems rather inexpensive to rent I was considering a cosplay skating day.
up to 100 people for 2 1/2 hours (or more if there's high interest), we can bring our own DJ (so maybe use our own weeb music? if not I know a DJ or we can use the skating rink's), if we get ~50 people it'd be like $10 per person which includes skate rental. I know I can get a bunch of people that'll go. we can bring outside food in if we need to.

but this is like super super "hey guys what if lol" early idea stages

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Someone was inspired by that panel yesterday.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

:doge:

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Not that I'm not on the hook from *certain* people to do a photoshoot event at some point.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Do I hear the sounds of a FANDOM EVENT getting planned

;3c

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

purrhaps :3c

does it sound like heavy breathing, mothballs, and pocky because probably

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

snerk.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-15*

Would be cool if ice skating cuz I'm a decent skater boi

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

#realanimeboytom

Ice skating is already an event, Georgia's been to that. Marisa's talking about setting up a roller skating one.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

nyoom

(if this happens i gotta do neon)

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Nenyan

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

I'll let everyone know when ice skating is posted

Of course üòè

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

thank~!
I'll ask around for interest and think of potential dates. Probably end of november if planning starts now?

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Contest: Who can find the most events to go to outside of cons in the course of the year.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

is this a real contest because i will do it

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

I mean, I like spending my weekends surrounded by ~~white haired~~ people dressed in anime outfits.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

a circle of people livestreaming each other

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

accurate.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

End of November/Beginning of December is a good time

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-15*

can attest for toms skating sillz - mine not so much XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Not too close to holidays or midterms or finals

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Stay outta december. I literally don't have a free weekend in december, and you got the JLPT.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

End of November it is then lol

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

> Implying I have to be at the event

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

You do lol

Personal note, Sunday's are better than Saturday's

True facts also: Sunday's  are better than Saturday's because people have Saturday's scheduled for shit lol

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

**indeed**

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

true, they only list saturday on their website i'll see if they're open on sundays

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Places like that occasionally set aside days for private parties, they might have sunday like that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Oh no Marisa I have extra red fabric from Pyrrhas sash and I have white fur

_what if I sewed my own holiday outfit_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

***follow your heart***

a sign from the universe

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

(that's what I expected was going to happen in the first place)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

i considered it and might do it if i find some inexpensive fabric but also i am incredibly lazy

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

So you'll just do it the week before Konkon.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

mm. yeah probably.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

More like follow my DESTINY

ayyyyyy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

~DESTINY~

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

As the only archer here, I'd appreciate it if you didn't follow DESTINY exactly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

[the rollback on destiny commences]

Semi-related question, but how is everyone spread across the country, and in conjunction with that answer, is a cosplay workshop day feasible?

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Lets see... Shortlist:
Tom, Jess and I are North Jersey
You're in what would be central if central existed.
Andrew and Marisa are 30 minutes from Phili in south jersey. 
Hal's in the place my boss doesn't think exists: Delaware.

Almost everyone else is in one of those groups, the short list is just whose been discussing cosplay in the channel.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Sooooo feasibility?

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

You and I are the only ones who really do lots of travel.

Or like doing so, etc.

Easy logistical way would be to go to south jersey, Tom and Jess can ride with me and it skirts Andrew and Marisa not having a ready means of transportation, unless Hal was coming up and grabbed them going north...

I mean, I'm speaking for half a dozen people here.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

So it's /possible/

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

And my personal motto is "Where there's a *Will(iam)*, there's a way, and I've got a way.".

(Also tldr how I'm going to end up at Katsu.)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-15*

What are we doing? üôÉ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

A cosplay workshop day (possibly)

cause I was thinking about how lonely it is hammering grommets in alone LMAO

and none of my other cosplay buddies wanna get a jumpstart on cosplay like I do

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

True that never happened yesterday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-15*

Oooo ok that might be fun! I'm not working on anything just yet, I also don't know how to sew üò¨ I have a machine at my parents though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-15*

Yeah I have a crap ton of supplies and a pretty good knowledge of a few cosplay aspects so

I'd love to share with alllllll

i forgot to get a picture yesterday of that neo who said they wanted a photoshopped thing of themself but i got a picture of this Pure Boy

or girl. Pure Child.

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

I mean, #behindthescenes

But I do keep talking about getting into a cosplay and I'll have to do something along that regard soon.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

My high school acquaintance is the owner of the skating rink it turns out. ''Tis a family business that's radical.

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Inb4 neon.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

Strong contender

throwback to almost falling down a flight of stairs during the photoshoot üëç

need a poofier wig. i can just. glue it all.

**Bill** - *2017-10-15*

Cosplay is what, tears, glue, and duct tape?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-15*

from the impression i get yeah

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-15*

no no the tears might stain the costume

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-15*

theres a tear bucket which collects them for later use

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Is that workshop idea something to do soon?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

how does potentially november 18/19 sound for a skate party potentially

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-16*

Sounds goooood

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Wait. That's AnimeNYC. I think.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

hnnahgdhraj

would people want to go during thanksgiving weekend? probably not

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-16*

That's Anime NYC AND Derpycon actually

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

haha rip

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-16*

What about the 12th?

And thanksgiving weekend I think is a strong maybe

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

I mean, I'd thanksgiving it.

Not my holiday.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

i'll have to ask if they're open sundays or would be willing to open, also my nephew's birthday is around that time so I'm waiting for my sister to tell me when the party is

their default reservation thing says saturdays either from 4 to 6:30 or 10 to 12:30am but I know the owner in that i probably had a few classes with them in high school maybe 8)

according to bojo thanksgiving weekend is probably bad because the owners might be on vacation but again it's something  i can ask the venue



**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Go November 4th. Short notice best notice.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

o that is a weekend isn't it. hm.

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Mostly sarcastic.

Not that it couldn't work, but stress.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

**stress**

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-16*

True so much stress

(Also I get my wisdom teeth out then)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

omg that would make it so much funner. skate in cosplay in anesthesia.

november 12? if they're open on sundays if not rip we try again in december

or thanksgiving

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

I know I'm out in December, more than likely.

Give em a call, see what happens.

People on my news feed: it's üçÇ so we're üçé picking! XD
Me: my schedule is full of cosplay events. 
Also me: cos... play apple picking?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

i facebook messaged him eyyy
i'm jealous i want to own an ice skating rink mainly because i wanna skate 24/7

they can do sundays from 4-6:30 and thanksgiving weekend is probably good, if that works for people. so like November 26th maybe. we can bring our own music but it's gotta be clean, so sorry to disappoint you guys I know you like the super explicit stuff.

**Heroth** - *2017-10-16*

You mean I can't listen to "get low" while ice skating?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

also probably a no-go:

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Pfft.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

can you imagine showing up to an event and all the music is kidz bop
genius

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

but like, weeb music? I got /all/ the weeb music

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

RWBY soundtrack "I Burn" Kidzbop ver.

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

None of the RWBY songs are explicit last I checked though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

I Burn has some cursing in it

like, at least 3 curse

does november 26 from 4 to 6:30 sound like a plausible date for people for nerd skating

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

nah, that's georgia's thing. I'mma just threatening to keep Tom from his desktop.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-16*

Also yes Marisa.



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-16*

T_T

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

this was supposed to go in shitpost, whoops.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

no takebacks

26th is possible for skating and he gave me a bunch of options of how we can do it (advance ticket sales and whatnot even).  so I'll probably pick that date, we can have 3 hours of cosplay skating , there's an arcade there, a snack bar, and we can have up to 300 people. woo.

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

There you go. Now to go *public.*

imagine derpycon and anime nyc upon their claws

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

<@301927856240459777> no I need help with a piece of my cosplay have you or do you know someone who has had to make a helmet for a costume before? I have no idea where to start T.T

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

what type of helmet? :0 is it for a certain character

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

yeah 1 sec and i will get a picture of the character



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

I looked up the character, so it would cover the entire head? Would you use a wig or would the pink part be part of the helmet?
It might cost a pretty penny but it's doable
I can find you some resources for plastic and stuff in a moment

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

the pink is part of the helmet

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

<@!301927856240459777> if imma vice host, I want an SOS dan armband.

Cause I'm a weeb.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

I dunno what the back looks like so if it's a full-head helmet it might be difficult getting on and off, unless you articulate it somehow like Lelouch's Zero mask does in Code Geass (where the back can rise up). If the back doesn't matter you could stick some elastic bands there. Perhaps for a full one you could do two pieces, a back and a front, that connect on the sides somehow if there's a seam anywhere. I would recommend magnets but magnets mess with the brain I think? So perhaps velcro or snaps and a good friend who can help you put the mask on.

I would recommend making the black part around the eyes (or at least around the nose) out of fabric, since if it's all foam/plastic you may not be able to breathe and that might be a small problem. A black spandex would work, like what morphsuits are made out of, but check before you buy it that you can see through a layer of it. Then you could do the eye design in more fabric or paint it or such.

The silver part could be a thermal plastic like worbla/wonderflex (they come in sheets) or instamorph/similar brands (they come in pellets), or I know insulation foam is very popular for helmets but because that silver part looks thin you might want something sturdier if you intend to wear this costume a lot. Craft foam could also work, but it's flimsy and would have to be backed with something. The hair would be easy, insulation foam boards or plastic or whatever you desire, sanded and painted and sealed and whatnot.

Make a test helmet out of paper that you can use as a pattern, and then make another test one out of cheap craft foam to again make sure all the proportions are right and that it would fit before moving on to the real thing.

here are some links for plastics because they're a bit hard to find in stores (the pellets can be found on amazon)

<@!184437198865563648>  that can be arranged if you wear mikuru's maid dress

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Why would you /want/ that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-16*

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*



Don't you start.



All with in 15 feet of each other.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

there u go. north jersey with its convenient access to stores like that.

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

NYC.

There's another one too.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

<@!184437198865563648>  this look familiar, this is why i wanna do the cosplay. i already have the belt i just have to make the armor XD im gonna go insane making this

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Oh my god that thing.

The thing that converts 100 dollar bills into plastic. XD

Can we acknowledge between the collective social circles on the server, we have over 100 people to invite to this roller skating event?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

lets get all those maybes to say yes :3c

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Shits insane.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

im debating on going

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

u go ya

I WAS TYPING PLS AND HIT A BUTTON AND CHANGED EVERYTHIGN my computer screen is tinted now aah

pls go for my sacrifice

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Eeeeeeeeeh

I recognize a bunch of people, but I wonder who invites who.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

marisa this is the only thing on the back for a refrence

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

The 5 degrees of Kevin bacon and all that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

ohoho gotcha. hmm. no seams.

no wait there is a seam there's HOPE

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

i plan to make the back piece out of paper mache then sand it paint it and waterproof it someway

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

oo fancy

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2017-10-16*

that way it should be light enought to wear all day and i wont have a big weight on my back all day

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

paper mache can be heavy depending on what kind is used, plastic might be lighter in some cases, but also my mileage with paper mache has varied greatly and I didn't know what i was doing 60% of the time

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

Eve does a lot of 3D printing, she might be able to do something.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

so i can totally bring custom music to weeb skating. any requests while I go on a spiritual journey trying to find the perfect songs as I wait to finalize a price?
I have Shine from RWBY (Dance Dance Infiltration), the opening of death parade, platinum disco, the ending of dangan ronpa's anime, the movie version of zen zen zense (your name), and rinbu revolution (revolutionary girl utena) as strong contenders right now. probably also something love live and attack on titan? hmm.

or we could go with default skating rink music but. weeb music.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-16*

Na gotta be week music

Weeb**

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*



**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

I've got a shitton of anime openings.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

they gotta be catchy/popular and we gotta properly organize 'em though so we don't have, like, Marisa Stole The Precious Thing (great song title btw) followed by Komm Susser Tod

ai like hamburger on repeat for 3 hours

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-16*

The first opening to noragami gets me hype af but idk if that's the genre you looking foo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

I was thinkin' about that! oo.

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

How do you have to bring the music?

mp3s? god forbid cds?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

he said an ipod or usb would work

we have to play it ourselves

get your lute ready

**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

So playlist it up.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

here's a picture of the dj setup it seems intense



**Bill** - *2017-10-16*

I don't know if I have a way to give you a list of the music I have, but it should help pad the list.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-16*

got one of those record spinning thingies. i have the boy and the best soundtrack on vinyl we can jam to that.

I can get mp3s off of gendou if i don't have it already

the site may not have been updated in a while I can't tell.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-18*

Yessssss

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-18*

What color? I can recommend brands

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-18*

Pink

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-18*

Lemme check real fast

https://www.honeycolor.com/sweet-bliss-pink

I'd recommend the "sweet bliss" brand, they're the most comfortable I've had and last a while

I have them in red, purple, and green, and the color is really vibrant if that's what you want

That's the Pyrrha contacts I have on Instagram if you wanna see how vibrant the color is I mean

**Bill** - *2017-10-18*

Can confirm, special eyes.

also, 
Number of color contacts: 5. 
number of not color contacts: probably 0.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-18*

Ooo ok thanks a bunch! I've been so nervous to order them, but paying $80 through my eye doctor is just not worth

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-18*

Besides actual contacts? Lol

Oh yeah that's not worth it

Also they'll look really different in indoor versus outdoor lighting





There's my green indoor and outdoor for reference

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-18*

Oh yea that always happens

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-18*

Ye so if you decide not to go with sweet bliss

Make sure you google the one you want first cause other peeps have probably taken pics of themselves in them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-18*

Okey dokey thanks alot! üòÅ

Have you had any brings that were just terrible? üòÇ

Brands*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-18*

sadly, the color black in contact form is usually horrid

Idk why so if you need that color you're outta luck

But not any brands specifically

I've been loyal to sweet bliss ever since I got their purple contacts for Yang lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-18*

Alright cool

Ooo says they have to verify with your eye doctor tho I technically have astigmatism so when I got my last colored contacts they just upped my regular numbers to compensate, but thats not my actual perscription üò≠

I just wanna be an anime girl who can seeeee

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-19*

i feel your pain. my eyes are too awful for anything other than giant glasses.
there's always photoshop? ;~;

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

Discord finally started working?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-19*

i return to my computer! üí™

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

üò≠ I sent an email to my eye doctor begging for approval üòÇ if that doesn't work I might just get plano lenses

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

stick plastic over eyes, be blind. Still better than old blindfold 2B.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-19*

"dear doctor-sama
pls.... i got..i gotta B kawaii. sensei p ls.
arigato, jess-chan"

that's how it went right

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

Exactly how did you know??

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

Speaking of contacts, I really should get more at some point, but I'm too lazy lmao

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

I'm in the bar that after party takes place in. Not impressed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

üòØ

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

Admittedly not packed with nerds but still.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

True, online it pretty much looked like your average bar, but I think venue secondary for the event most important is music

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

Possible.

The whiskey bar next door has actual food though. Much livelier too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

Call them up and tell them to change the location

**Bill** - *2017-10-19*

Nah. I'm sure they booked American beauty both cause cheaper and and apparently 4 floors.

I only saw two.

I'm not preordering a ticket, that's for sure. (For the afterparty)

We can find plenty of places to hangout in NYC.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-19*

That is true

Have you seen Tom? I'm surprised a goddess hasn't dropped out of the sky already, he looks like a main character.

Heck

**Bill** - *2017-10-20*

How many do I book is the question.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-20*

The whole hotel

**Bill** - *2017-10-20*

Pull a Next got it.

The Sheraton isn't really cheap (unless god forbid next negotiates a decent deal) but we had 8 last year. I'm probably going to try for at least 3, and see what kind of shortlist we can pull together.

Granted we didn't do the 2 on the floor shtick.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-20*

I'm sure some people ship jaune/Weiss

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Ofc

My boyfriend and I cosplay them at the same time and always joke about it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

NOW ALL WERE MISSING IS REN

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

REN COME TO US

**Bill** - *2017-10-21*

You got Nora too, or was Casey counting for both still?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Yeah Casey is Nora

And Lissy (fem sun, was also at colossalcon east as Blake) as Blake

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

Should the costumes follow that design from the picture earlier exactly, or can we go off-picture?

**Bill** - *2017-10-21*

Saaavy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

i found this and it's essentially the same dress i wore last year but I don't wanna infringe on anyone else's character if we're goin' with exact designs

dis could b us

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Omg that's Sarah from Kogarafest

I don't think it has to be EXACTLY the design but it should prob be close

I guess I'm more concerned that the reds match LOL

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

omg really?? The yang or another cosplayer? Hehehe

**Bill** - *2017-10-21*

I've got no practice with large group shoots. Imma have to learn aren't I.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

Yeah the red on my cape and the red on the dress I have are slightly different shades but it's easier for me to remake the cape than do a whole costume I might not wear ever again, but I also don't want to be that person who shakes up the harmony in the group so if we're going for exact to the pictures I can work it out!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

The Yang LMAO

And by extension I know the winter

OH

I KNOW THE WINTER

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

all these people able to make costumes oh man i feel like a sack of garbage with how gung-ho they are :3

the crinoline i made like 3 years ago is crushed so while looking for a new one i'm gonna. avoid this petticoat company probably.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

What company?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

"full red std" is the name of the product üôÄ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Hm sounds like something no one would want

ALSO DONT WORRY YOU DONT GOTTA MAKE IT

you can buy it

It'll probably be close enough the same color

You're good

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-21*

OH THANK GOODNESS arigato
like I could make it if push comes to shove i just don't have room at the moment
the one i have now i was gonna modify is stretchy red velvet i can like smear fabric dye on myself if it doesn't match

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Yeee we can do a run through before the main shabang

that's like 3x my maximum budget though i'll probably just live in a ditch

**Bill** - *2017-10-22*

worked for Andy in parks and rec.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-22*

only for so long

poor him

**Bill** - *2017-10-22*

He got a wife. I mean.

He's very happy.

Also that's what, 300 square feet?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-22*

that blueprint? 92.3 square feet.

it's huge

relatively

**Bill** - *2017-10-22*

92 square feet is a dorm room. **maybe**.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-22*

lol it's probably bigger than my current house
all the apartments i'm looking at are are 50 feet at most.

though my house is also 2 floors. double the fun!

wait u may be right

math was never my strong suit

protip that I totally knew all along square meters to square feet is a different conversion than meters to feet

**Bill** - *2017-10-22*

I just confirmed with my Dad, it's 300.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-22*

that's a film

i don't know what's on TV right now but I swear I heard them say "Hayao Miyazaki cut herself when she jumped out a window into a river"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-22*

What's a rest room

If not a bathroom, what is it

**Bill** - *2017-10-22*

it's japan, so the bathroom is fancy and shit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-22*

o the bath and the toilet are in separate rooms

ye so fancy

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

@everyone not a drill, I called the Sheraton on a whim and rather than tomorrow the staffer said possibly today for the room block to open. Watch Animenext's social media carefully.

Course no guarantees it'll open even tomorrow but better safe than sorry.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-23*

I just find it amusing they know what **literally everyone** wants and continue to ignore it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

Would they hype up an announcement this much just for room blocks?

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

yeah?

**Andrew** - *2017-10-23*

seems anticlimactic

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

considering they **still** haven't opened them.

Also the woman on the phone said maybe today, which means Next has been in touch with the hotel recently.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

But usually announcements this hyped are events or celebrity guests

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

If this is a celebrity guest I'mma throw rocks at the founder.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

pls be celebrity guest. A cool one but one I don't care about because I won't be there

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

There was also a troll by one of thier staffer's in the animenext group, in response to a comment about room blocks.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

Maybe it's something about cosplay wrestling, though I also doubt that. They probably won't be back at zenkaikon. Or maybe I dunno the con chair did change. 
Jim knows what the announcement is you coulda asked him at kogara :3c

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

they didn't make the the announcement until late last week.

Also, why /wouldn't/ room blocks be a big deal?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

Predict the futuuure
it is a big deal but not super big. they'll open eventually once all the staff rooms are sorted out. plus there are plenty of peeps that commute or stay outside the hotel room block anyway.

It could be room blocks but my suspicion is something else

**Andrew** - *2017-10-23*

Opening room blocks won't get them hyoe

Announcing a new feature/event/etc will

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-23*

maybe there announcing room blocks and soething else?

**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

eh. There's been hints it is the block and this is the first year they've waited so long.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

Ye. It's a bit early for guests so I'd think it's... maybe like how otakon had the anisong matsuri this year? Maybe that. Or the US world cosplay semi-finales or something took place there a few years back maybe they're doing that again. 

Also wow old con center is a warehouse now. Warehouse party.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-23*



**Bill** - *2017-10-23*

yeah, there's been a bunch of that.

THAT reminds me of that time I saw Marisa at one of the raves, I'm not sure where all that smoke around her came from, but snoop doog would be proud.

and the /glowsticks/. Rockfeller center has less lights.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-23*

My backup idea was a love live but purrhaps

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-24*

I'm just saying that the fitting-ness

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

Marisa was a jack of all trades cosplayer: then Georgia turned her into a rwby cosplayer.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-24*

No warning

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

plenty Georgia. just thinking of Awakening, which I believe is still fan favorite.

ooooh, no wait, go old school and do lyndis.

she was **the best**.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-24*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

Most girl characters are pretty cool. Scarlet ye. In hindsight I'm surprised I've never seen a Nah cosplayer while Nowi, nah was pretty popular

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

I've seen a Nah cosplayer.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

Yeah I've seen them before just never as nowi

"Can you tell me your name?"
"Nah."
Classic.

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

Funny story, I've take pictures of her multiple times and she remembered over the course of like two years. Not like, in a good way, more like a 'didn't you... already do this?' way.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

Of nah?

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

Nah, ye.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

"Nah"

Omg in Japan there was a girl from china in our dorm called Yu, and it got so confusing. 
"Hey lets go to this restaurant."
"Sure this place is neat how'd you find it"
"Oh yu showed it to me"
"What? When did I show it to you?"

Similarly
"Yu left a bunch of stuff out"
"What? No I didn't, where?"
"No not you"

We had to start calling her yu-chan

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

that's why.

It had nothing to do with you being huge weebs.

(Why not call her table-chan)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

Indoubitably
Two people can't have the same nickname come on

i would have said yes already if it wasnt a 3 hr drive

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

Vintage outta my anime folder: all the way back to when I actually tried to name every picture I saved.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-24*

i had a pretty good collection back on my old shitty desktop

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

It's an easy drive.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-24*

then i realized that i could just look em up and grab em whenever i wanted and i gave up

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

Depending on what I'm doing though you'd be able to tag a ride with me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-24*

<@!301927856240459777> you may be better off making the roller skate event public just so it's more accessible

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

I originally made it private to prevent drama because I'm rather clueless when it comes to who's good and who will cause trouble, and since we have a person limit I didn't want it spreading too much if that makes sense? I can make it public tomorrow if people think that's a good idea, but I'd like to make a deposit on the rink before I do that and I've been trying to see if we can get a certain number of people before that since it's non-refundable

If we can get 25 people we can have it at $20 per person for 2 hours. If most of the maybes are able to attend (which I know is super hopeful and probably won't happen) we can keep it at 3 hours and sell tickets cheaper.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-24*

Yeah I don't think there will be drama, and if there is you know you'll have friends who will help you remove anyone who causes issues

That's how I see it at least

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

Heather at the Atlantic City Sheraton probably hates me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-24*

Oops 2 bad

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

When you call everyday you should use a different, highly exaggerated fake accent.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-24*

"ah yesa hallu ma name is a villiam clahk"

**Bill** - *2017-10-24*

No, cause if I build up a repore it might help in the long run.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

Why would you want to be alone in here

if you were cosplaying a character that had an ID badge as part of their costume (like this:
http://otaku-w9pxf76zfsktmx3e.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/plastic_memories-13-isla-happy-id_badge-photo-cute.jpg )

....would you use a picture of their badge exactly as it is from the anime/game, or take a selfie and photoshop a picture of you cosplaying the character onto the photo portion of the badge.

discuss/argue aggressively.

**Andrew** - *2017-10-24*

Huh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-24*

Hmm ü§î

**Andrew** - *2017-10-24*

That is actually relevant to a cosplay I was planning

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

hey-o nice, a purpose to the question!

on one hand if it's a scientist/doctor that not's a major character and doesn't have any obvious identifying traits (like a leopard print coat and blue hair), the badge would help people know who your character is.
on the other hand, it's a bit more realisitic to use a real picture.

10 minutes until the Big Announcement :3c

whimsical bill are you ready? only 5 minutes left!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-24*

He's driving home but said he was gonna stop somewhere at 7

Now to manage to book it despite everyone else trying to.

This is why I like booking a non con room then transferring to the block later.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

silky's voice actress is someone i've never heard she better be spot on or i'm rioting

Do you know how fast zenkai booked for 2018 Marisa?

I think it was within a day.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

chise's voice actress is a new face to the industry ooo that's exciting

i don't since that's a totally separate part of the con from me, but I do know it was like within 2 or 3 days

staff suite was a lot better this year too except for the time i walked in and like 10 staffers were sitting dead-eyed around the TV watching johnny test

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-24*

Lols

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-24*

i asked one of the staff suite staff what was up and they went over there like "guys. i know you're dead but let me put on something respectable"

Convention stuff in OOC
Animenext exists in aurii confirmed

**Bill** - *2017-10-25*

oh fuck.

eh.

not like it strictly matters, and I was typing while on the phone.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-25*

Nokri gonna cosplay as a silent hill nurse

219 a night is pretty good :0

**Bill** - *2017-10-25*

<@&359123249139023875> 
+ AnimeNext room rate (all room types): 219 a night
*No Other rate can be used because Next bought the whole hotel.*
+ There's a block cut off date in the computer for May 7th; as far as we could tell it means you can't do anything but cancel at that point
+ Total with tax for two rooms is 1502.38, 751.19~ for one. 
+ There's a parking fee that's some amount as well.
+ Fun fact, **Good Guy AnimeNext** negotiated the rate down from 249, a whooping **30 dollar savings**.

<@&359123249139023875> downpayment required, so unless I get a list of people that exceeds last year I'm not putting down the cash for it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-25*

Nooo you can't delete that from OOC it's already canon

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-25*

So it's total 1502.38?

So that's the number you divide by number of people who join the room

**Bill** - *2017-10-25*

for three nights, two rooms yeah.

yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-25*

I think AnimeNEXT id only drive down Friday morning cause it's just an hour and some to go

AnimeNEXT isn't my big splurge con lol

**Bill** - *2017-10-25*

I don't like Next's prices, but it **is** the con everyone and their mom goes to.

But thursday is for driving down and then partyin hard.

I suppose.

we didn't end up doing that last year.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-25*

Thursday is for finishing your costumes in the hotel room because you procrastinated too much and didn't finish that last piece

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-25*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-25*

Of course

I was that cosplay in the swimsuit

**Andrew** - *2017-10-25*

You had me as a cardboard cutout remember

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-25*

Classic. And we all went to that panel together with cardboard cutout Andru.

**Bill** - *2017-10-25*

Panel we all went to together...

Cardboard!Andrew really liked that Boudoir panel, didn't he?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-25*

No it was the 18+ despicable me minions panel

Man cosplay burlesque is horrifying to run crowd control for thoivbv

Though

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

I should probably make an official shortlist...

https://gist.github.com/Willowlark/89fcbfeee6b5a343bb15075a8045dcc2 Huzzah, I spend two hours writing a script that makes this!\

Tax is annoying as hell.

https://goo.gl/forms/xCFj5BbhddXlX5VH3 @everyone Not game related but related to pretty much everyone: I need a list of people who'd want to room in the rooms I booked for AnimeNext and Colossal East. Survey completes that objective. (I have the colossal one partly from way back in september, anyone whose already said they're in for it gets dibs of course.)

second person to fill that in: You didn't put your name in.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-26*

A ghost

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

Oops I didn't see a space for that on mobile

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Just redo it and add it~

Oh <@!141729881779077121> <@!184440044822462464> , when you see A-Aron pass him that form. Why isn't in here again?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

animeNYC released their schedule yesterday if anyone's interested  http://animenyc.com/panels/

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

So few panel rooms.

inb4 animeNYC is just Saikoucon NYC <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858>

only interesting stuff are the cosplay panels in the morning, and that's not even for me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

nO

Anime NYC will be funsies

Yang V4 will be funsies

Though I don't foresee doing the V5 outfit because I hate it and find myself relating to Yang less and less as time goes on

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Is that what you're doing for NYC?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

i might go to the Armour making panel

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

fire emblem?

gotta be fire emblem.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

Yeah I'm doing the tank top and robo arm for anime NYC

Cause I wanted an excuse to make the robo arm really

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

i dont really have anything in mind currently but i feel like its relevvent info

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-26*

Did you guys see the video of people who gave Barbara a statue of yangs severed arm

well not a statue because it was flesh-like

https://youtu.be/dq1_XNVeRmE?t=7

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Naze.

Aww, I don't have a japanese keyboard configured on my macbook.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-26*

Â£∞ÂÑ™„Å†„Åã„Çâ

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Yeah I don't remember those kanji.

_assumes he's being insulted_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-26*

barb is yang's voice actress

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

I know that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-26*

they gave her a severed yang arm

and they filmed it in a video

did you see it

her voice actress

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

only other thing id be like minorly interested in isnt until like 9:30 RIP

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

The horror panel?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

yea and the dystopia one but thats bout it

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

Well I recognize the horror panel name, I'mma bet it's the same people who travel the con circuit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

oh ye aprob

so man industry panels

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

That's why I was hesitant on ANYC to start.

Industry con makes me think of comic con and I ain't about that. Fandom is good.

and Derpy is a thing too, and apparently alot of people are going.

or at least, I'm seeing stories on instagram talking about going to Derpy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

sleepover at ma place and then derpy on sunday

**Bill** - *2017-10-26*

I could be game for that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-26*

party all weekendddddd

as long as my bff doent want to do anything on her birfday which is that day

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

lol helpful.

https://goo.gl/forms/xCFj5BbhddXlX5VH3 reminder to do the thing if you're going to cons with dis guy. *points to Tom*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-27*

Does that mean your using Tom as a selling point? Or implying he didn't fill it out?

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

Obvious a selling point. #reallifeanimeboy



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

I love them

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

I want to post that to instagram, just like that.

But then I'll have to commit to finishing that shoot from Otakon shortly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

Is there an Otakon folder I forgot about is that where that's from

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

... I think it's worth.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

It is

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

Georgia. There are THREE Otakon RWBY shoots.

You were at all of them.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

Perfect opportunity for reaction image that I'm gonna abuse the shit out of



**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

ACTUALLY.

<:Pyrrhatwitch:373476019736150017>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

SHES BEAUTIFUL

This is a productive use of time

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

stop, I'm actually supposed to be doing something.

I've already waste 15 minutes finding that image for you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

And I'll never forget the kindness you've shown me in doing so üòá

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

<:Pyrrhatwitch:373476412172009474>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-27*

The circle of stupidity is complete

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

lol. apparently icon worthy.

do I add this to... whatever shoot pad I'm on for Pyrrha now?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-27*

every time i see chibi pyrrha ill forever hear a distant ***im sorry***

**Bill** - *2017-10-27*

I dunno if you were on that livestream when she did it, but Georgia has a legit pyrrha voice.

I was impressed.



Actually I saw this one today and love the art.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Pfft I can only do the "hello again!" That's not THAT impressive

<@!301927856240459777> is the event still private for cosplay roller skating

Otherwise I'll share info about it on my insta

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*

Is it possible to change it? I'm looking for the option now but can't find anything and google says it's not possible ._.

crud

i'm like 75% sure that was an option to do in the past at some point, did facebook change the event settings? or have we just crossed into an alternate dimension because there's no way we could be remembering wrong

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

I thought it was possible .-.

**Andrew** - *2017-10-28*

I know it used to be possible

I did it before

**Bill** - *2017-10-28*

I actually don't see the option.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*

Time to sue Facebook

New event page: suing Facebook in cosplay this time its public

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Nice

@nerds how do I get into fire emblem and which are the strong cosplay-able ladies

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*

Buy awakening and one of the fates games (and then both of the fates games). Pick favorite strong woman out of many (too bad some don't get enough character development rip)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Which one first

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*

awakening came out before fates so i'd recommend that first
then in fates, birthright is easier and focuses more on characters/being able to build up support chats for them.  you can battle as many times as you want. conquest focuses more on battle strategy, you can only do things once and you can't grind meaning that character interactions are a lot more precious (because characters bond through battling together and that's how you unlock their conversations)

birthright and conquest are the same thing but from different viewpoints and then there's a third that combines the two

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Okie dokey

Thank üôè

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*

some characters are unique to each game in fates also, as seen here. they show up in both games as enemies but usually you can only use them/chat with them in one game

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

I'm peepin at those redheads üëÄ

**Bill** - *2017-10-28*

Just play awakening.

Cause that's what brought fire emblem back from its downward spiral.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Kewl

Will do

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*



**Bill** - *2017-10-28*

me.

also, be prepared to ship for days.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

GOOD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-10-28*

you control all the ships :3c the power is in your hands

actually i'm surprised fire emblem doesn't have too many public / super noticable ship wars. unless i'm blind which is a high chance.



last one sorry i promise the last but best one

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-28*

Anna and Cordelia are the big red heads

**Andrew** - *2017-10-28*

Marisa pretty much nailed it

Awakening then fates

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-28*

Niceeee

I'll do that then

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-10-28*

Yeah I agree

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-10-28*

Marry Chrom that is all you need to know

MARISA COSPLAY ROLLER SKATING HOW CAN I HELP

<@!301927856240459777>

**Bill** - *2017-11-01*

Get people to commit to going.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-01*

PEOPLE
I was also thinking if there was a backup like we could chill at a park or something

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-01*

The private event thing makes it hard

Otherwise I could post to Insta and 1700 people would see it

But it's hard getting hype for a private event

Contact Facebook to see if they'll change it

**Bill** - *2017-11-01*

Wrong time of year for a picnic event. *no particular reason I can say that no*

Finn posted it to the rowan anime club page. I'm not sure if that'll actually display it to anyone but it's an effort.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-01*

OH yeah she asked me about that, she's sharing it elsewhere too

if anything she has like 5000000 friends

**Bill** - *2017-11-01*

I don't know if uninvited people can follow the link is all.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-01*

it shows up for me. hmm.

**Bill** - *2017-11-01*

A share isn't an invite.

You need someone who isn't invited to look at it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-01*

yeah i'm curious about that because I can see it and it's hilarious being able to see it and having the one guy go "when and where is it"

someone just hit "going" but i don't know if it's because they were invited before or if they're in the anime club

**Bill** - *2017-11-01*

I invited Jen.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-01*

okily dokily that answers that

**Bill** - *2017-11-01*

She was the archery president. Good Frendo.

ah yes, the Blake I low key chased down at Next because I hadn't seen a Blake that weekend and needed to collect them all.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-01*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-02*

<@!301927856240459777> my friend Justin commented on your post

He knows a bunch of other cosplay people answer him and tell him he can invite all his friends

Also, kick facebooks butt and get them to let you change it to public

**Bill** - *2017-11-02*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-02*

MARISA DID YOU KICK FACEBOOKS BUTT

I mentioned cosplay roller skating in my live stream today

If we could just get the event public I could help send a lot of traffic your way

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

I SENT THEM A MESSAGE so far I've only gotten an automatic "Thank you for messaging Facebook your inquiry has been received" type of thing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-05*

Okay cause if you can get it public I can spread the word everywhere

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

K, so this RWBY group at konkon is going to get poached by other photogs hard.

How handle.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

***fight***

every day i pray we can do the mean girls dance still i hope that's a thing
i have a go pro and a camera that films pretty nicely
i have hardcore editing software
i have a burning passion

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-05*

theres no stopping them

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

it's true.

I'm not usually super picky about it either.

I just don't want the case of that guy pulling people out of the 2B^2 shoot entirely.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

if it does happen I think it'll be more of a case of "that whimsical guy is shooting JNPR now so I'll take pictures of RWBY" or such.

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

like, the people in the shoot were missing photos with the whole group because of the guy pulling people aside.

It'll help if I know what I need the whole group for, then I can bang them out and then people can spread a bit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

that would be up to the individuals then not to wander off. it might be good to set a schedule like "for 15 minutes we'll all take a big group shot, break for smaller group A, smaller group B, then another group shot" or something like that

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

that'd the idea.

start large, go smaller.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

ye

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

I just have to figure out how to take decent photos of 12+ people.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

everybody get super friendly. cram in so we're not spread out. get uncomfortable.

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

oh ye.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

i think a big thing will be finding a spot to accommodate us that doesn't bother the poor normal people going about their business

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

truuuu

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

hopefully not a lot of people will be there that weekend but it's always swarmed with people rip

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

and as far as I can tell the attendance has doubled from last year.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

there's plenty of space but the whole point is the background scenery. especially when the lights come on, everyone wants pictures with the lights and there are limited spots that are good. we might need to take a few shoots, step aside for other peeps to get pictures and move elsewhere, then head back for more

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

yeah. Should propose it to the group about waiting for the lights.

That said, I'm not great after dark.

<@!245270932602486784>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-05*

oo, day shots are always cool too. are you proposing we only take dark shoots or that we take a break between day and night shoots?

**Bill** - *2017-11-05*

I wasn't banking on trying to do the whole group in the evening.

Hell, we all left around dusk last year.

too cold.

Yoooo  peeps how do guys Christmasfy an outfit for this thing?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

I think most people are making 'em but I bought one to alter and combine with existing parts of my ruby costume because no time/space. They're basing the designs off pictures but some are coming up with their own if there's no reference.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

Ooo ok I feel like a girls outfit isn't hard but idk for boys what to do

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

Who ya doin?

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

if you're still working Tomu over on rwby, look up Mojojoj's art. He's done christmas versions of almost everyone.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

*whispers* 'm in negotiations for Ren and Nora üòÇ yea I saw the rennora one a few weeks ago only thing is Im having a hard time finding something like that

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

link it and let the experts handle it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

is it ok to have ren in green or should everybody be in red?

because i thought it would be neat for some characters to be dressed as reindeer/trees or such but there was talk of red coordination

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

just tag georgia already.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

Ye we (or maybe just me because I'm paranoid about everything) were wondering if it was ok for characters to be green or brown (reindeer) like that or if everyone should be in red

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

I like Green santa. not going to lie.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

Why is it neon?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

the company it's sold by seems pretty legit as a typical cheap costume dealer
neon to spread christmas cheer

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-06*

i feel like ren would need a vest

like a christmas vest

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

What, like a green button up with a dark green vest?

That actually sounds good.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-06*

no

like

just a vest

and like

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

lmao cosplaying is like my #1 motivation for working out actually lmao also i have a new mat

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

To be fair, that's fairly common.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

I mean, I knew you had the bug, but way to embrace it!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

i mean it was a basically a useless room otherwise? weve had the idea for awhile but finally had the time this weekend

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

I mean, you do have /guests/ over.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

o yea, the beds still in there so it can still be used as a guest room when needed

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-06*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

i got a message back from facebook that they can't change the privacy of an event, and a lovely tutorial for creating a new event on public. <:riptombstone:369476083248267274> 
skating maaaay have to be cancelled and reimplemented in the future ‚Äß¬∫¬∑(Àö ÀÉÃ£Ã£Ã•‚åìÀÇÃ£Ã£Ã• )‚Äß¬∫¬∑Àö

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

Post an actual deadline first.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-06*

Facebook is useless I tried to contacts then for help with our company page for work and they were like "na sorry we don't help with that anymore"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

Last week I think I mentioned a one week deadline, I can give it another day or so after tonight. I'll also send some messages because the people who always said "yeah! We'll totally come to any event!" are either listed as maybes or never responded even though they saw the invite and I was really banking on them because they always said they would definitely attend  if I made an event üê§

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

Passively aggressive message all the people!

Also, I don't remember seeing a date but okay. Give it a couple days and post an all caps bold date on it.

CAUSE IT'S HARD TO MISS ALL CAPS.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-06*

***AAAAA***

**Bill** - *2017-11-06*

no italics.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

***sad!***

oooo the owner of the skating rink is willing to lower the price. from ~$600 for 3 hours to $350 for 2 1/2 hours.
if I made a new, public event and posted it in the old event (and then cancel the old one after a few days) do you think this could work or would that annoy people?

with the number of people we have now at that price it'd be <$20

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

I think it'd confuse the heck out of people.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

mmmmmmmmmmmmm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

Yeah

Keep harassing Facebook

But I'd take that deal

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

absolutely.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

ya think it's ok we if keep our current page as it is? i already sent 2 messages to facebook and got the one reply, i don't think the second reply will be any different (if they haven't already deleted it like "UGH this chick again")

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

lol

I mean.

I'd leave it and post something about 'we're trying to get a price drop but the guy wants to know how many are coming' to encourage people to commit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

Wait like one more day for Facebook to have a chance to reply

Their customer support is shit tho

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

facebook did reply.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

Oh and they were like "no" ?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

i tell people every week to hit "going" if they can to lower the price, plus that's the pinned post, I think that'll just annoy people

yeah facebook said they can't change it and sent me a tutorial for making a new event page hehe

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

THANKS FACEBOOK

it may be beneficial to make a new page idk

But that's also sorta annoying

Damn you're stuck

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

mmmm

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

be a pain in the ass tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

I'd keep the old event if it were me, and just make sure to promote that it's a public event

I'll post about it in Instagram

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

we could get a lot more exposure if we make a public event

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

yeah, keep the original.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

but if you post about it on instagram wouldn't you have to friend people to add them? would you be ok with that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

Mmmm good point

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

eyy jess eyyyy 8)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

You have enough time to make a new event

That much is true

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

Eyyyy sorry it took me so long üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

eyyy tom 8)

we could definitely do $20 per person with the number of people we have now, if we keep the event page as-is and don't make a new one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

I mean a lot of those people are friends too

So we can get all those people back with a new page too

#devils advocate

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

ü§î

pre-christmas rwby meetup at the roller skating rink :3c

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

You can shamelessly promote in the chat

Most of those people are in the area

https://www.facebook.com/events/559664744217753/permalink/748681368649422/?ref=1&action_history=null ANYC group, the map has arrived.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

O.O

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

i know you mentioned it, would be fun! were you thinking sunday?

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

Friday would be tough.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

tru

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

actually. We could go to the one in the city?

con closes at 10 after all.

on saturday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

good point, was anyone planning on doing the after party thing?

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

I mean, you'd be asking me. Tom don't drink, Georgia, Hal and friends are underage.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

oh shiiiii

then D&B would probbaly be a good idea so everyone can come

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

Yeah actually.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

plz dont lose me on subway

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-07*

I need to clear plans but it looks like Friday night we're going to Ryan's I think

And then Saturday we hang and Saturday night take the train back

Cause Sunday I have family stuff

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

sounds like saturday could be a thing.

we aren't staying the city overnight either saturday, so D&B would have to end before last train.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-07*

Prob should shoot for a different weekend tbh

Don't go overboard now

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

But I like having friends!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-07*

Same but can only fit so much into one day :P

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

depends really. ANYC's evening lineup isn't all that exciting iirc.

around dinner time it might make sense to and head to D&B for it.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-07*

People also might wanna get outta there before late

It is the city afterall

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

late trains in my experience are less crowded.

less prone to delay too.

also D&B is a 10 minute subway ride basically door to door.

from the con.

that's nice.

cause as far as late, my usual policy to to consider the second to last train as the latest train.

just in case.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVhH6Be9CEU

That's a video from the people doing the afterparty at ANYC, same place.

People look bored, ngl

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

First pieces of Christmas Nora came in!

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

Wait. Did not get decided yesterday? Even Amazon two day shipping can't get you things in one day.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

Ordered sunday night

More stuff should come tomorrow

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

Beeeeefore official convincing of the Tom? üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

Amazon shipping is best shipping
I ordered my stuff from china, one thing was supposed to be here yesterday and made it to NJ two days ago but apparently now it's headed towards Nevada so we'll see how that turns out :3c

**Bill** - *2017-11-07*

So it was just on the wishlist already.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

Nope I'm just sorry quick like that

Speedy*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

Nyooom

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-07*

Had to jump on it before he could change his mind

Also apparently this company think they are witty

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-07*

ooooOOHOHOHOHO 10/10

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

We still got over a month so you should be good üëç

Tom's attempting to fix a second hand sewing machine we got now lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

O my mother fixes sewing machines for a living if u have questions stuff I can ask her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

Ooo that's super handy! Thanks

The manual needle up and down the knob won't turn like it supposed to so we took the too off and there's a thing deep inside that won't turn (super descriptive I know)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

Can you take a picture of it
What did you take off, the knob?
It might just need to soak in sewing machine oil for a bit (but only like a drop or two you don't want to drown it in oil)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

yea thats what i was thinking, might try to work on it more tomorrow?



Whatever that is lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

Her recommendation is:
The machine may have been sitting unused for too long or been in a dry location, try putting a single drop of oil on every spot where metal meets metal (or moves) and let it sit for 20 minutes and then start trying to move it

If it's too far down to reach you can use a straw to guide the oil down there

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

Oh ok thanks momma! I'll probablytry that tomorrow

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-08*

Yeah the manual it comes with has a diagram where all the oil goes

**Bill** - *2017-11-08*

Damn. I could have been done with colossal's photos if only someone didn't sit in the third seat.

Totally didn't spend my last half hour in the office finishing the last of and uploading all the colossal photos.

**Bill** - *2017-11-08*

Arcade cosplay.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

cool pictures *like this!!*
not really you probably can't stand on the skee ball game and it might not light up as much if there is skee ball. i know there are games but i don't know what kinds I can find out this weekend.

go to rowan to get skee ball cosplay pictures

rowan is like 10 minutes away from the skating rink it's very viable

**Bill** - *2017-11-08*

Didn't the skew ball break years ago?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

at rowan?
i can't remember but I did play it earlier this year with someone else
i didn't know there was skeeball there or else that's where i would have spent my 4 college years

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-08*

Oooooooo very much cuter

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-08*

i thought because kuroshitsuji has a circus arc (ark haha get it) people in japan would know about circuses but they have no idea what they are. our circuses are the equivalent of like. tea ceremonies or geisha or something that americans have heard of but know nothing about. fascinating.

Which is TOTALLY not me profiling a cat burglar as Blake because of her Faunus heritage.

**Bill** - *2017-11-09*

I mean, I thought I was. As long as I get a haruhi armband.

And I'mma always help out a friend.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-09*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-09*

Thank. Biru u can claim that. There won't be much that needs setting up since the rink will be operating as it usually does, but we might be able to use a custom playlist eyy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-09*

I plan too eventually! I need to get a wig because the whole cutting and dyeing my hair thing wasn't that great, and also id like to find a way to do the tattoos thats easier and faster then  sharpie

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-09*

Exactly why it's a funny joke ;3c

Also YEAH please do cause I'm making Athena ;3cccc

And I appreciate more borderlands

Also I can help with the tattoo thing

Lemme find it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-09*

üòÆ thatd be wonderful lol

also it worked for that day cuz i had no other cosplays but id like to not be blue for the next 3 days after wearing the costume lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-09*

Ok so you need to get Ben Nye in light blue

It's FX make up/face paint hybrid

And then you can just use a wet paintbrush to paint them on

And then you seal it with baby powder and hairspray

And if you want them to glow in UV light there's another paint you can put on top of that to get that effect

Though that's bookmarked somewhere in the depth of my compooper

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-09*

üòÆ does it stay on pretty good, but come off when you need it too? also those tattoos are just a bitch because of the pattern lol

**Bill** - *2017-11-09*

which was another problem when talking about it for colossal.

Water + paint = eeeeeh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-09*

Oh yeah it's oil based too so you won't sweat it off, you just need to use soap

**Bill** - *2017-11-09*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-09*

Also you can use Snazaroo instead, but that's water based, so you're more likely to sweat it off

But it is cheaper and comes off easier

Also I know body paint like the back of my hand

EXHIBIT A:



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-09*

ooo neato! thanks for the advice fren

i was thinking of maybe getting like child size skin coleoed leggings or tights and cutting a hole for my head, then just coloring in the tatoos on that so i could take off and re use it whenever i needed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-09*

Ooo das a nice terezi
I've done that before and I can recommend a really good tights website with all kinds of colors. You can also sew them into gloves and glue on fake nails.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-09*

Welovecolors.com I think is what you're gonna say

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-09*

Ye that's it. Their opaque solid color tights or something like that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-09*

^^^

Those are good tights

Colored tights, at least

For skin color (like Pyrrha) I get Capezio tights cause they're hella durable

And blend pretty well

true, costumes would probably encourage carding.

Though I'm told Wolf's Tones doesn't card literally ever.

You have two options.

Unless you want to do kpop!Ren.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-10*

You aren't wrong

I also already have the 9s wig

**Bill** - *2017-11-10*

because once you go white hair you don't go back.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-10*

i was think i at least wanna do a shoer haired character lol cuz trying to mange a long wig on skates is not gonna work lol

**Bill** - *2017-11-10*

feel the wind in your not hair.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-10*

also i don't recommend you skating in fake glasses and a long wig XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-10*

That was a deciding factor for me too, not wearing Weiss cause the ponytail would throw off my balance

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-10*

tru, maybe 9s then actually

Backlog:
<@!301927856240459777> : Why need home photo studio?

It was a quirky meeting (in person) with the IBM team with this channel going off about drawing on tights in the corner of my screen.

<@!245270932602486784> : I was going to say connecticon is a long drive and probs meh, but there's basically a train right to it from penn station so I mean. Hell, the trains 10 minutes longer a trip than driving from Sussex. 

I'm basically Qrow, good to know. First one to jump tackle my arm gets a cookie. üç™ 

And Wolfe tones is halfway across the city from Javits center, while yesterday's information was interesting I doubt anyone'll want to travel all the way there. (Going W<->E is harder than N<->S I find.)

Do you have the rest of 9S?

And what are people doing, generally.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-10*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-11*

Remember when castle point and zenkaikon made arrangements so that they wouldn't wind up on the same year 
And it kept happening anyway
ha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-11*

They did?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-12*

Yeah they had a plan in place so they wouldn't be on the same days because it really damaged attendance on both ends and castle point still dropped the ball

Just finalized everything for skating. It's really nice the place is super cool. No skee ball but it's been pretty much entirely refurbished.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-12*

Thats awesome üòÆ is there arcade?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-12*

Ya there's a few games (rip phone dying and no wifi outside the skating center) (but the skating center has free wifi!)

Ok so he said we can decorate the place as we'd like. What if. 
.
..
...
cardboard cutouts of waifus around the outside of the rink for no reason. Life sized of course.

Just a poorly crafted life sized cardboard cutout of Victor from YoI next to a similar cutout of Konata from lucky star just because

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-12*

Where do you buy such a thing

Do they have inline and regular??

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-12*

Money can be exchanged for goods and services
Or a bit of Photoshop and lots of printer paper and an exact eye.

I asked that!! He said they do have both but because they used to be quad (regular) only they have a limited number of inline skates

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-12*

Ok, I'mma bring my shitty inlines just in case

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-12*

^^^ ditto

So what do they mean when they say "you can decorate" as you want

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-12*

He said they have 5 to 10 which I think meant the sizes but ye it wouldn't hurt to bring them

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-12*

I thought you were gonna post a pile of ash

**Bill** - *2017-11-12*

I think I still qualify as a pain in the ass for that one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-12*

She's perfect

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

It's been so long since cons, I forgot what the con facebook groups were like.

Lineup posts and photographers begging for work.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-13*

Iof

Oof

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

ANYC's is tiny though.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-13*

I gotta see the little crown into my track suit for yato

Not really sure what material to use

Sew*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-13*

haha i did a line up post for colossal even if it was just 3  versions of the same character

do i hear a michaels or jo annes trip in our future?

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

also added an <@&379678830941437962> role and gave it to every going to ANYC.

so you can ping that con specifically. con circuit unit is kinda everyone who'd want con news.

Though I should confirm that list is accurate.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-13*



<@!351471675843411978>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-13*

2penny? pennyb? adorable either way

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

Emotions are prohbited while in COMBAT READY mode.

why does it feel like all the cosplayers are going to derpycon and not ANYC?

I feel like I want to go to Derpy too, like Friday or Sunday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-13*

Lol I fee like we've had 3 different ideas for Sunday so far lol

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

we did, kinda.

we gotta do one though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-13*

so its Derpy or DandB right?

**Bill** - *2017-11-13*

Well, I feel like we should make D&B a big thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-13*

ok so maybe derpy then?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

<@!301927856240459777> Idk if you started yet, but my humble recommendation for the music for cosplay roller skating should be like 40/60 split of weeb music/everyone-knows-these-songs pop

I find that works best for most con playlists

So good weeb songs being like, the Yuri on ice opening, (shameless plug but) shine from RWBY, etc

And then the other half being like mr brightside, bohemian rhapsody, etc

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

Oo that may work. I've been trying to find weeb songs that everybody knows. I've considered the yuri on ice theme but wouldn't it be too slow? (Unless it was surrounded by other slower songs or I used the ending theme instead)

w-what's mr bright side üò± anything non-anime I will require assistance with

A DJ friend once told me how to DJ for like 10 minutes. I've been trying to put that brief lesson I learned millennia ago to practice

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

Dj Mai Risa-chan.

üé§üéß

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

People went bananas for the Yuri on ice theme at Katsucon .-.

So idk I think it works

If it's what I'm thinking of (I've never seen YOI)

Also I GOTCHU I KNOW ALL THE WHITE PEOPLE SONGS

Can we play the Macarena

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

[brings my flute] hey guys instead of pre-recorded I'm going to serenade you all with live music [plays zankoku no tenshi no thesis]

YES TO MACARENA

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-14*

I will get so hype for Mr brightside I'm not even ashamed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

Were you at the Katsucon dance too
what were you cosplaying

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

I will go ham on mr brightside it's my fav song

And Yus I was Marinette in a ladybug dress

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

:0

I may have seen you I can't remember rip but I have a ton of ladybug pictures from Katsu
I was Pyrrha awkwardly hanging out with a bunch of cooler jnpr cosplayers who kindly let me chill in their vicinity

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

WERE YOU that's so cute

Wait

Was there a Jaune in a dress

In converse

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

Ye one was with me but only for a little bit and there was another one too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

You're not the one in this photo are you



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

Hahaha no

I would never be cool enough

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

lol It's Mak.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

My cats favorite toy is missing and I'm helping her search for it but I'll find a picture of my gross self in a bit
The jaune I was with wasn't allowed in the dance because of his shoes despite the other jaune having been able to get in with the same shoes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

Interesting

Bill what if on roller skating playlist: i will survive

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

I JUST WROTE THAT ONE DOWN MARISA



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

WOO

all the songs gotta be kid friendly non-explicit also. i don't think you would put an uber explicit song in the mix but just in case you've got that hardcore side

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

My punk rock self must be tamed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

what about disney songs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

Fair game, but you don't wanna go too heavy

I'm trying to have a healthy decade balance too

For time periods of songs

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

dont forget those 1880s jams

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

Of course

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

i was considering this and looked up the music video yesterday
but
where are his clothes at the beginning
why they do that
why
https://youtu.be/AE4b9jO1uB4?t=20

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

Go find a kids bop album.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

great idea
that solves everything

only $10 an album on amazon what a steal

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

Ok I got some old songs

Also some meme songs

Now I need early 2000s because we're all sad 90s kids

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

darude sandstorm
the llama song

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

Remember how people only dance to "every time we touch" my jumping up and down

Can you imagine

_Roller Skating Chaos_

Is it bad I predominantly want to use the shrek soundtrack as inspiration

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

no that is natural instinct guiding you

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*



I don't know any weeb songs I'm a bad weeb

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

i know 7 of those songs!!! woo!!
i know every weeb song i gotchu on that front
i just dunno if other people know the same weeb songs. popular online doesn't always translate well to reality orz

megalovania

tfw cool patrol has cursing in it so it can't be played. i cry.

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

Lucky star op better be there.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

also for haruhi would Hare Hare Yukai or God Knows be better

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-14*

Which ones do you know?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

All Star
Bohemian Rhapsody (to an extent because people sing it at cons all the time)
I need a Hero
Single Ladies
Ain't no mountain high enough
YMCA
1000 miles

i think i know walking on sunshine and take on me. maybe. the latter because of nsp and the former because of a flute thing in elementary school.

also a jam (imo)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iF00RVjxnd8

omg I know KonoSuba is pretty popular but I don't think people normally go digging for things outside of the episodes. if they do though, one of the original OSTs has two of the characters in a rap battle for no reason.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-14*

Africa by Toto and Shooting Stars

By someone

Oh it's by Bag Raiders, pls play all meme songs

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-14*

Hate have yukai is better for sure

Wow auto correct

Hare hare

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

Do rap battle konosuba for my own amusement. Also why not both, O Haruhi Sama deserves both.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-14*

Oh that other anime meme song

One of the gatari endings

Ren ai circulation

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

Is it an actual accurate cosplay group or like a bikini cosplay group
I would be impressed by bkth

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-14*

You should join

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

but ditto, that's such a weird group.

Remember what I said about cosplay being totes normal in NYC?



Fate stay night archer just walking around world trade.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-14*

oh well would you look a that

**Bill** - *2017-11-14*

Stopped and stared for like a minute to be sure it wasn't the Archer cosplayer I know lives in Brooklyn.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-15*

o is that not a fate cosplayer?

ALSO SOMEONE SUGGESTED MINAMI'S BOOGIE now that's a good Yuri on Ice jam

if I had endless time and a private skating rink i would totally learn the choreography for that

**Bill** - *2017-11-15*

ANYC facebook group:

<:riptombstone:369476083248267274>

**Bill** - *2017-11-15*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-15*

**Bill** - *2017-11-15*

I love how her personal facebook account is a cat.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-15*

Oooo

**Bill** - *2017-11-15*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-15*

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

can't tell if ANYC is going to be a shopping or cosplay con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-16*

XD yeaaaaa

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*



"No, as in I want to get shot. High crime rate in NYC right?"

Thanks Ugonna.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-16*

Lmao

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

I've seen him before.

*Surprising* I'm sure.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-16*

Gotta visit dat animenext booth at AnimeNYC they said there may be discount codes

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-16*

Oooo

**Bill** - *2017-11-16*

Ye, they had them at Kogara too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-16*

üí∏üí∏

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

Did I ever post kogara pictures ü§î

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

do you ever post pictures?

<@!141729881779077121> you're... going to be at Konkon.

and you're... not, part of the army.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

tbh I always intend to and then remember like 10 months later "HEY! I never posted those haha oops"

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

not at actually kidding in the xmas chat, I need some kind of flag that ID's me as part of the group. Not just because *it'snotlikeIliketobeincludedoranythingbaka*, but because as discussed before poachers is going to be a thing with a group this size at an event which is like half photogs.

and I need ideas.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

Nah there's like 1 photog for every 3 or 4 cosplayers usually. They're outnumbered. 
Wouldn't it be fine for photographers to get pictures of the cosplayers that aren't currently getting pictures taken? As long as if a shoot arises the cosplayers can return

Like that schedule idea

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

It's more a concern for while we're doing big things. Later branching off makes sense, there's only so much to be done (and I'm not crazy enough to make a steno up for every individual character in this group).

but it /will/ happen. Especially now that the group has been publically recognized.

So ideas.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-17*

accpet the fact that there is nothing you can do

or cosplay lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

mace the other photogs if they get close

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

See the tsundere reason, that's also important.

hi <@!141729881779077121> .

waaaaacha doin.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Work

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

Thought you started at 2.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

130

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

boo.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Til 10

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

more boo.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Retail fun

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

you ever play games with the customers that come through?

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Like mess with them?

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

Not like, *with* them, but about who passes through.

I'm trying to remember what I used to do at Quickchek.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

I watch who comes in

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

nah, people might get salty if you messed with them.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Get a lot of regulars who do the same thing every day

Also get people who scheme every day

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

Ah, we had to push cookies at the counter (which no regular ever wanted but *still gotta do it*) so I turned it into a game of sorts on the counter.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Like their goal is to get like 1 dollar free every day

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

I think I actually played some game on the counter with some people. when it was slow.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

I have 1 or 3 customers that play games sometimes

But they cone in rarely

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

I don't want to call it game though, that's the thing. I had some reason to do some "thing", whatever it happened to be. Minor, easy, doable in a few seconds.

And I'd try and get the whole line waiting in on the goal, which was usually do the thing X times or so.

I don't remember at all...

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

You remember enough it seems

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

I remember coming up with 4koma scripts for Resident Evil characters the first summer at Quickchek while working.

I still have that file, somewhere.

I wish I remember what it was I focused the game around though. Probably those damn cookies.

OH. I think it was like I had a basket of so and so many cookies or whatever and the game was clearing them off the counter via sales.

....maybe.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Perhaps

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*



**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

Well see you in 2 hours

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

I'm not driving down to shop rite in... whatever town that is.

All of south jersey is glassboro to me.

reasons why I have a countdown timer to Colossal East and not Next:
The flask I brought to Next is half full.
The flask I bought at Colossal is empty.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-17*

Hell yeah!

Also wouldn't recommend drinking outs the next one üòÇ

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

Yeah, probs.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-17*

Collosal has prob been my favorite of the year tbh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-17*

And you don't even drink!

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

I was ABouT to say that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

Shoutout to drunk Mother who abandoned her kid to stalk one of the guests at a con, to the point where they needed an entire security squad and multiple decoy vans

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-17*

Wtfffff

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

Also to 12 year old girl who wandered away from her mother and was found making out with another older girl. Security left because the parent looked like she was going to explode with rage.

Con stories are wonderful pls share any you may have

Drunk Mother one is a doozy if anyone is interested but I've only heard it second hand I didn't get to witness the glory

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-17*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

omg hehehehe. was it the white one from nier?
I can't remember which con but it was one of the bigger comic cons, I want to say Wizard World in Chicago or something like that

**Andrew** - *2017-11-17*

News from Derpycon:



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

they aren't allowing cosplay?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-17*

Reiley says Derpycon is making people wear badges on their person too

And a lot of cosplayers just stick them on their bag

What dramaaaa

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

So glad I didn't say screw it and pick up a Sunday badge.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-17*

i know he's had difficulty finding staff for it because no one really wanted to staff it and it's been meh in the past but that's kind of a shock. i wonder what happened.

i'm not seeing any mass complains on social media (facebook/instagram/tumblr/twitter) boooo

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

<@&379678830941437962> it's going to rain tomorrow. Much like Japan, New York is the kind of place to have an umbrella.

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

About A+ hover hands?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-17*

No when will noragami return from the war

**Bill** - *2017-11-17*

Hover hand is a better story tell that one.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-18*

google image search 'hover hand cosplay' for many tragic stories

any others Stories from Derpycon?
their website says masks aren't allowed except for quick photos so that may be why earlier they were asked to take the bandana off

**Bill** - *2017-11-18*

Nope. I don't really know the person I quoted.

Conversation dropped off quick.

Yea

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-19*

Are all the panel rooms at derpycon so tiny? Todd haberkorn live tweets his panels and his tweets of derpy show a room that fits like maybe 50 people at most. Unless it's just cropped weirdly.

Found another picture. Room is bigger than originally thought but still looks tiny.

O right y'all're at animenyc not derpy

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-19*

Yeee and we didn't do a single panel here

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-19*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

https://youtu.be/6SwiSpudKWI?t=31

https://youtu.be/6pA_Tou-DPI?t=68

gotta love minute long intros on youtube videos. i tried posting links to exactly where the actual song starts when applicable

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

what are the odds there's going to massive attempt at going out to eat together after roller skating/konkon?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

I thought about that. I think smaller groups are more likely than every single person going together.

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

Funny thing when smaller groups start befriend each other.

they get bigger.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

Ye but restaurants can't suddenly accommodate large groups like that unless it's a relatively empty fast food place

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

but it doesn't mean people won't want to try.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

Ye
People were also asking about food at the rink, they may eat there

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

it's going to happen though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

Ye

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

course I'm worried about us, not the event at large.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

? Why

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

cause we gotta make it happen.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

O. Fast food or make a reservation now then. Gotta be able to split the check too wooo

all my restaurant connections are down the shore rip

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

"hi yes, would like to split check 30 ways."

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

^^^^

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

I dunno how many it'd be though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

If it's that many people even a fast food place might not be big enough

Solution: picnic in the dark

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

Thought about that.

order pizzas to random field.

in all seriousness, Landmark can probably reserve it's back room if it's a big enough group... And I doubt the campus will be too busy with thanksgiving weekend being a thing. Rink was right by Rowan right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-20*

"Address: dark field next to the highway. Look for the man in the pink glittery dress amongst the many costumed figures. His name is whimsical bill."

Yeah the rink is like 10-15 minutes away at most, but doesn't the campus mostly close down except for bare bones during thanksgiving? Or is landmark not technically part of the campus. I've never been.

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

landmark is it's own entity.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-20*

would you have to pay to reserve a room though?

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

They recommend just making a regular reservation. Party packages are for closer to 30 people, which is a bit much for the assembled direct friends here.

But they'll take the reservation as early as we have it, so if we get a head count we're golden.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-20*

well theres 5 in your car alone XD

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

Ye.

And once again my camera is in for repair.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-20*

üò≠ oh nooo

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

If they don't fix it this time...

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-20*

You could try throwing it at the ground again

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

Better yet, I have to pick it up and and bring it back ANOTHER friggin time for this autofocus issue.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-20*

It didn't break last time

**Bill** - *2017-11-20*

There are things we don't joke about.

That's one of them.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-21*

Haruka kanata

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-21*

The lights dim. Everyone awaits with baited breath as the music is turned on. First song begins playing. "Marukaite chikyuu, boku Hetalia"
Everybody starts leaving en masse

Was considering Simple and Clean maybe but apparently these albums have every kingdom hearts song and remix of that song EXCEPT the original version 
I'm gonna sue

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-21*

Had a balcony room at Katsu a few years back. Like maybe 2014 or 2013. Waved at some people on the other side of the atrium and they showed up at the door to introduce themselves half an hour later saying they counted up and over to find what room we were in. Weird.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-21*

thats amazing

**Bill** - *2017-11-21*

so to pick up from last night; Post roller skating reservation at Landmark is doable, just requires a head count.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-21*

depends when does everyone get kicked out of the roller skating

**Bill** - *2017-11-21*

whenever Marisa booked it till. (total side track, Bishamon followed me on instagram.)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-21*

Yeah me 2she was asking about the pictures

**Bill** - *2017-11-21*

but uh, you didn't take any lol.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-21*

No more so that if we see them do a tag

**Bill** - *2017-11-21*

Not that I think I got much of all three of you in frame.

aaaaah

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-21*

There was another photogrpaher there too so we'll see of his turn up as well

Roller skating ends at 6:30, I may need to stay behind to handle final payments and help clean up if there's any messes. Don't make messes. <:dab:370384480613040138>

Are people doing anything before skating or are y'all planning to arrive in scenic south jersey when it starts?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-21*

I got stuff to do in the morn

So I'll get there when it starts

**Bill** - *2017-11-21*

Coming down earlier made sense to me. Help setup. Catch-up. So on.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-21*

We will save you the rolliest of skates

So biru and co are getting there early? I will wait for y'all to arrive because Im a little hesitant to face my old classmate and his workers alone in a purple wig and frilly dress.

He knows it's a costume event but given the pictures from his Halloween event I feel like he's underestimating cosplayers

**Bill** - *2017-11-21*

lol I'm sure andrew can accompany you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-21*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

O I never really thought about it. I've shared the link before but don't really invite people individually.

Since it's a public event I guess I treat it like a con. When otakon or such makes a public event for the con the link gets spread around but people don't normally invite one another ya know.

I won't be able to attend any US conventions for my 10 year con anniversary üôÄ

Where's that old article about how cosplay has evolved and how difficult cosplaying was up until the 2010s

i shall continue my monologue woo
i can't find it but there was a really good write-up about the last ~20 years of cosplay and how it's become much more accessible. someone was remaking their edward elric costume and when they first put it together in the early 2000s there were barely any cosplay resources. no colored wigs so they went with a natural blonde one that was off what ed's looked like and it cost them a couple hundred dollars (if memory serves). The costume was utterly fantastic for it's time but nowadays with the resources available it was considered 'meh' I forget how they said the rest of the costume was made but it was basically about how now you can buy the entire thing (wig+costume+shoes+contacts) for less than $100. 
it was a cool write-up. like the one about obtaining illegal sailor moon and inuyasha VHS tapes before streaming services and official US releases.

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*

I can't keep track of how many people I've invited lol

or who.

which is confusing.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-22*

Neet bit of historyüëå

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*

"NEET" lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

Does anyone think it'd be necessary to have bracelets or tickets at the skating event as proof someone paid, like if they need to go to their car or something? The rink doesn't have them since people just pay as they go in. I don't foresee a lot of people coming and going repeatedly so I don't think it'll be necessary. But I'm asking just in case you guys think everyone is gonna come and go all Willy nilly.

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*

I mean, if we can get them it's kinda cool to have a memento of the event.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

Also we should break even but if there's any additional money that doesn't go to the rink it's getting donated. Any charity preferences? I was leaning towards putting it in with Zenkaikon's charity because they donate to a specific charity every year and for like 5 years it was my staff position to coerce people into donating so I'm biased.

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*

Like con badges, which I keep.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

It's a bit late to be ordering badges and custom stuff but we can get generic wristbands

I've made my badges into a costume

I think I still have like 90 glow stick bracelets from when I cosplayed Neon

UGH I do but the connectors aren't with them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-22*

Give everyone a glow stcik when they pay and then you'll know they paid  if they wanna come back in

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

Yeah but are people gonna have pockets and places to put them? I also don't want people leaving them behind and littering the place up. Or am I overthinking it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-22*

well like the barcelt type so they can just wear them

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-11-22*

I mean they'll prob take care of any sutff left anyways nbd

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

I have the glow sticks but I can't find the connectors that turn them into bracelets.

we can't leave the place a mess omg if there is even a single candy wrapper on the ground when it's over I am scolding everyone collectively like an angry parent

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-22*

we help do a clean

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*



Landmark was always good about their specials.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

Ok which of us are pretending to be kids and what qualifies as a kid

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-22*

Sheeeeet boiiii

Lmao Tom just had a split second thought (about cosplay roller skating)  "will there be a photographer at this event? Oh wait duh"

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*

Looooololololollllll

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

I'm sticking a GoPro on my head
If biru is ever busy as a photographer I can take pictures toooooooo~

I may turn you into a bobble head fair warning

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-22*

1. GLOWSTICKS YES

2. Who commented that I wasn't being ladyboog

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

u did! ‚≠ê

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-22*

Henlo *rips off Pyrrha cosplay to have ladybug on underneath*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

Pyrrha includes a skin-colored spandex suit that, when ripped off, turns into ladybugs red suit. Genius. 
Pyrrha and tearaway pants

**Bill** - *2017-11-22*

Appropriate reaction to the dead Pyrrha news.

Becomes ladybug.

Pyrrha is ladybug AU?

Someone should have written that fanfic.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-22*

She isn't dead she just went to another world where she became Marinette, just a normal girl with a normal life

Have you ever seen Henshin Ninja's famous sailor moon masquerade skit

they've done it again a bunch of times with chibi moon and other scouts or outfits but the original is still great

**Andrew** - *2017-11-24*

Shinanegans

Wooppee

**Bill** - *2017-11-24*

I can never spell that word.

**Andrew** - *2017-11-24*

I don't know if mine was right

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-25*

less than 48 hours before  i trap everybody with 2 1/2 hours of Crazy Frog music. that's it that's the reason we're skating.

**Bill** - *2017-11-25*

https://www.facebook.com/kiravoices/posts/735532726637728 damn.

Oh man. I forgot howls moving castle is in theaters tomorrow. We coulda planned that then roller skating.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-25*

Nearest theater to the rink only has a showing tomorrow at 1 :0

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

Lol Facebook has an "event story" for roller skating.

That's simultaneously hilarious and weird.

Also it's 38 confirmed now.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

It was that and then a bunch of people switched to Not Going and then a bunch of people switched to Going so the attendance stayed the same. Woo.

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

I just looked it's 38.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

Yes.

It was also that like 2 days ago but then yesterday a bunch of people played musical attendance

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

Though... I tease the event story but it might be a good idea to post to it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

I greet each visitor with a custom personalized dab

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

As the event time gets closer.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

It's not showing up for me eyy

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

App up to date?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

Is it like one of those "on this day" or friendship posts that appears at the top of the page 
Yeah because I can't download animal crossing

Sad!

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

O there

If you can see it then can't every attendee?

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

Probably. I'm not marked as cohost or anything right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

I don't think so

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

So then everyone (except you apparently) can see it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

There's a Bratz doll box that is horrifyingly illuminated by the light and nothing else this is terrifying

It's a Hebrew bratz if that changes anything

**Bill** - *2017-11-26*

Objection, Relevance.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-11-26*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-28*

Gooooood question

**Bill** - *2017-11-28*

It would be a fun con to lurk around with friends, and the city is cool in the evening.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-28*

You going to saikou?

**Bill** - *2017-11-28*

No, we hate Saikou. or rather are extremely disappointed in.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-28*

ooo lol might i ask why?

**Bill** - *2017-11-28*

just so small it wasn't interesting.

I went for the day and basically followed Georgia and friends ‚Ñ¢ around, they'd have a better description.

or in this case, Georgia and maybe Hal, since Hal came midway through like me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-11-28*

like smaller than kotori?

**Bill** - *2017-11-28*

yup.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-01*

I'll have to hope Katsu accepts VHS tapes eh

Because that's much more convenient then emailing them the file

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-01*

Did... anyone ever submit them that way

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-01*

I'd post some kinda snarky poloroid about Tom, but he just had to be *completely perfect at roller skating*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

I was at a con once and I forget who I was with but friends of friends were cosplaying from attack on Titan and a janitor was cleaning nearby and they were like "hey ms janitor may we please  use your cleaning cart and mop and trash for like 1 minute" 
The Levi grabbed the mop and the rest literally took turns in the garbage I was amazed

is
is there a rwby character named oswald that i'm forgetting about
because i was looking at the overall list of cosplayers for konkon and the two most recent at the bottom are christmas sweater ozpin and oswald, both with (rwby) next to them.
who oswald

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

AND WE HAVENT RECRUITED THEM?

Also probably they mean Oscar but??? Idk

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

Hmmmm

Idk feels awkward

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

more so that we can get all the photographers there a blanket chance to shoot everyone.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

I don't follow

Like the photographers can shoot us as a whole using the separate event?

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

gunna watch rwby, brb

[hacker voice] he's in

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-02*

Lmao

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

I asked him if he wants to be in the chats though, given he's an adult he might be have reservations. Lets him decide.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-02*

I an also an * looks at hand * adust

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

accurate.

Mark is in his 50's.

He has you beat.

also: I mentioned there will be lots of familiar faces and he said that's what convinced him to go:
Mark is a DLC stretch goal unlocked by have enough rwby cosplayers attend.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

TRUE

and yeah man idk he definitely knows me hal you reiley

I assume he knows most everyone else

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

Anyone who was at Zenkai or Ota, and that's like, everyone.

(Except my nerds)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

_expand_ cosplay network

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

(I was at both) (I don't know them I'm a fail)

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

You weren't at the RWBY shoots.

well, actually. That's pretty much a fail yes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-02*

Savage

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

I got to make a lot of rwbies unhappy by prop checking their props

üëç

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

In before Tim recognizes you at the one who banned his minigun.

Cause he love that gun.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Vice department head had me running around the whole con because there were YoI cosplayers with actual skates that didn't have covers so they were just roaming around with open blades

Was his gun banned

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

nah.

Tim was the minigun coco at roller skating.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

There were 2 coco cosplayers I remember they both got their guns approved
I had to run after one of them too to double check

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

We know the other one too. Well, Georgia knows. I recognize.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

One guy came up with a prop gun, clicking it and making noises. Moving parts on prop guns aren't allowed so I apologized and said he couldn't have it in the con. Didn't pick it up or inspect it further because it already failed. He started arguing so my superior stepped in, she picked it up and it was like 20 pounds of real metal. Strike two no real metal bro that's even worse than the moving parts

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

Moving parts was always a weird classification for me

So it can't move like a gun

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT KILL ME,

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

But it can spin and stuff

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

I SPELLED AUDREY'S NAME WRONG.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

BILL NO

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

It's fine.

everything is fine.

He'll assume it's a typo.

or that I don't have any particular interest in his what, 13 year old daughter which is probably better.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

I can't recall the reasoning behind the rule but our prop check had no moving parts whatsoever allowed on guns. I think just to make sure it can't actually fire anything

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-02*

Where did you spell it wrong?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

^

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

in a message to him lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Now he's not gonna come great job

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-02*

Oooo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

Like I know the coco had a spinny part on the mini gun

But like obviously it was foam

Audrey is adorbz I want to take photos with her

_i shall make her my kohai_

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

she already learning how to die on camera from you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Ooooooo banned 4 life
(jk. The mini gun is so big we don't classify it with guns it's more an oversized prop so that's probably fine)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

OH NO MARISA MY MYRTENASTER HAS A REVOLVING CHAMBER

don't snitch on me bro

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

IT A SWORD IT OK

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

ITS ALSO A GUN

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

S'long as it isn't real metal THATS TRUE
LIFETIME BAN

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

He's in for the group.

I don't think I can add him though?

Georgia!

(Him and Audrey.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

To Instagram or discord

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

insta. Someone can link them discord there.

I don't have that invite link off hand and I'm lazy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

Do I add rwbycomics or oblivioncosplay for Audrey

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

I'd guess the latter.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Ok I have a post ready I'll go wait on Instagram

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

He didn't say.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

MARISA NO HES A TEACHER

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

BUT IVE TYPED IT ALL OUT

ALL I GOTTA DO IS PASTE THATS A THING THEY DO IN SCHOOLS RIGHT?

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

I've got it Marisa.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Can I post my tale :3c

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

no, bad furry.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

üò≠

Notice I didn't use the crying cat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

It's not giving me to option to add them??

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

who made the chat?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

Moi

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

does instagram have a chat size limit?

OHSHIT IT DOES

WE BROKE INSTAGRAM.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

I revised my story

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

I CANT BELIEVE IT

15 PERSON LIMIT

BULLSHIT

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

this is great.

it really is.

me and Marisa are the only ones who've been to this before.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Discord should work seeing as the miraculous ladybug discord has like 5000 people

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

no limit on discord I'm aware of.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Shoutout to that time it was uncomfortably warm

And then super freezing the next time

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

yeeeee

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

I mega lucked out that warm time I would be Dead it if hadn't been so warm. A literal popsicle.

My job in the rwby chat is done

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

I'm cry

In any other context, it would be odd to have a 50 year old in a chat with college-age kids

In _any other context_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-02*

Strangely detailed mouse emoji üêÅ

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

Ugh. Mangaloo. "Present Rose".

That was bad.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

Don't like it?

**Bill** - *2017-12-02*

The idea is cool, it's a pun, I'm just unimpressed by the pun.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-02*

_immediately starts wrapping Myrtenaster_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-02*

Lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-03*

O H the instagram cosplay contest thingy started already?
i knew that. i understood that i was aware. i shall tell my amigos they cosplay overwatch.
h-how do you copy/paste things on instagrams

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-03*

I do a sew!

Got our sewing machine up and running and it did it's first sew

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-03*

üëçüëçüëçüëç

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-03*

It's been a while o.o what do I do with the threads sticking it at the end? Tie em off?

Probably depends on the stich i'm assuming

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-03*

Nah you can leave them hanging as long as they're pulled pretty far through the holes

The holes being the bobbin area and the eye of the needle

Then you just snip snip them off the garment at the end

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-03*

If yer sewing I recommend sewing forward and then back and then forward again so it doesn't come undone at the ends

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-03*

ah ye that makes sense

just doing practice atm

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

huh.

My site activity spiked on the second.

I... didn't do anything on the second. no post, nothin.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

hmmmm

were you or georgia on it duing the party for any reason?

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

nope.



lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

hmmmmmm

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

better yet, half of it was facebook traffic.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

very interesting

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

_shrugs_

it's kinda fun to look at.



Wow. The philidelphia has both my Sparta nerds and my number one fan beat, apparently. üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

wuuuuuttt who is diis?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-04*

facebook traffic? mustve been links i sent

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

did u send links to my mom?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-04*

yeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

or just flicker links?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-04*

noope his site

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

that explains the other half which were direct links.

The facebook traffic probably is late comers to the roller skating album.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

<@!301927856240459777>  or <@!245270932602486784>  I have a question about sewing patterns: im usually like a size 4 but alot or patterns i see start at 6 üòÆ does sizing work different for patterns?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-04*

not that i know of

though i typically go a size larger just to be safe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

ok, i guess i could jut bring it in if it is too big

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-04*

yeah you can always make garments smaller but its hard to add fabric that isnt there

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

true, and 6 isnt much larger than 4 anyway

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

you know what must SUCK for Audrey?

Her Dad teaches at her school.

if she posts to discord at school her Dad'll know.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

oh whoa

BUT if her dad post, shell know

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

> Busts into Dad's art history class
> "Dad! We had a deal! If your not posting I'm not!"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-04*

lols they are 2 cute tho

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

they are.

When you see someone who could low key be marinette in new york.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-04*

nono
we don't talk about marinette in new york

**Bill** - *2017-12-04*

No spoilers.

I assume.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-04*

it's from the comic

we don't talk about the comic after that

**Bill** - *2017-12-05*

Oh, I remember that. Yeah, was sketch.

Things that amusement greatly: Mark online at school lunch time and Audrey not.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-05*

Yeeee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-05*

Audrey cant ground mark XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

shoutout to that one photoshoot organizer at otakon a few years ago who organized the shoot with some people and then none of them showed up. (not because something bad happened they said they might not show up anyway) (bruhs)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

wat .-.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

my knees are still bruised from roller skating XD

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

kawaii as fuck.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-06*

So is my knee lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

im hoping it clear up before konkon XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

i'm waiting to see if I have surgery or not today so I don't know when I'll be able to post i'm sorry BUT Y'ALL CHECK OUT THE FIRESTORM ON THE ANIMENEXT FACEBOOK PAGE IT'S GOIN' DOWN
https://www.facebook.com/animenext/?fref=mentions

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I'd rather you bring up why you might be going in for *SURGERY*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

ok but have you seen the page i mean I think the animenext admin might need some surgery if they keep taking shots like this

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

What happened

And Finn was like the first to comment on it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

they've been posting memes on the facebook page but not hip memes, and people are complaining because some of them are untasteful and also because this is a convention's facebook page not a meme page

also my jaw kind of hurts (has been for a while) and i can't properly eat or open it much because pain <:dab:370384480613040138> 
seeing if it's a dental issue that can be repaired today and if not i'm headed to another doctor

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

Thats not good

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

Okay, is he defending his right to do what he whats cause he likes it?

that's hilarious, you can't do that anymore.

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

Hope it's something not that bad

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

ikr they're losing so many attendees

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

Everything must be pre approved by tumblr.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

biru what would happen to your company if they started posting  bad memes every day

granted the yu gi oh hat one is prime meme content but the way the admin is handling it is super unprofessional

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

if you are trying to get people to buy things or attend something they have to pay for you have to maintain some semblance professionalism

yea who ever is doing their social media is pretty unporfessional, plus its just bad PR/marketing

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I'm agreeing with you.

Very unprofessional.

But.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

plus stolen memes and art

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I want to highlight that arguing back against offended people these days is a *crime against god*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

police are on their way for meme theft
i'm offended you think that and wish to argue further

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

/kickban

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

i think rather than arguing with attendees they should listen to the feedback and actually take it into consideration. a company shouldn't be arguing with a lot of its attendees

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

We're they edgy memes or like... just bad memes

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

there's alot that wrong with it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

a lot of fma chimera memes and tumblr screenshot memes

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

I did notice a lot of fma ones recently

Now that I think about it

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

it's unprofessional to have a meme account. It's unprofessional to say to customers "I'm the admin. I run this my way". It's UNHEARD OF to do so when you don't represent the organization as a whole.

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

Didn't really notice they were all from aneext

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

^

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I mean yes, people are easily triggered these days.

I'm not spiraling down that conversation.

but you don't use the organization you represents social media account to comment your personal opinions against it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

yeah, they're saying they're doing it to increase interaction with the fans but there are a hundred better ways that can be done

"What if a child is afraid of wigs: should we ban cosplayers from wearing wigs?" üåö

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

this guy is a fool.

If he's not publically canned Anext is going lose significant business.

Of course, I haven't liked the administration of next for years now.

So...

üçø

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

Ye I don't care either way tbh lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

think of the wig-fearing children u guys

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

The children part is fine tbh, I think it really just comes down to : hey is this a meme account?

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I'd say fine in what way, but meh.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

He shouldn't have even brought it up tbh

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

correcto.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

*le automatically assuming guy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

yeah it's the whole meme/unprofessionalism of it. i think the con board is going to have to have a very serious skype call (good ol' archaic ways of communication in the con circuit).
and then fighting back when people were like "hey... what is this."

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

they should be tossing this guy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

def shouldnt be in charge

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

i wonder who it is. they're claiming not to be the con chair but on the facebook page it says Team Members and the only name under it is the con chair's name, and i know zenkaikon's con chair runs the facebook page

like someone else from the con should step in and try some damage control :3c

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

Ye

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

Vince, whoever that is.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Ye das the con chair

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

yea but hes not the one running the account i think

cuz he started off the post with  "im not vince"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Ye the person posting is saying they aren't the con chair I don't think they'd dig themselves into a super deep hole by lying like that. They're already in hot water

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

this is so bad for PR dude

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

guy justified himself to people in the commnets with statistics.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Would angry and negative reacts also show up on it though. Like yeah there's an increase in interaction but is there a chance it's because of the complaints

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

yea facebooks metric are pretty much "all press is good press"

at least from what I've seen managing my companies page

**Andrew** - *2017-12-06*

So the adage goes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

Ye they're only gonna do something about it if they are worried about attendence dropping

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

I've seen a few people on my newsfeed say they won't be attending anymore that's how I found out about it :0

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

guess we'll all have to go to Otakon then.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

üòÇ

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

or if we listen to Marisa, comiket.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Make a new con. Animenextnext.

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

no.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

My friends all do this thing called comitia which looks like a similar comiket esque event but there's no cosplay so I'm gonna check that out but also be sad because no cosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

Hire me to do social media üòÇ I'm not offencive and Ill post good memes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Animenext^2

You're hired

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

> Tom gets hired over you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Now we have two social media managers who can bounce ideas off of one another to prevent this debacle :3c

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

Tom and I can manage it together üòÇ

Hot memes and actual important information

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

**WAIT**

Horimiya cosplay when.

***THIS ISN'T EVEN OPTIONAL YOU HAVE TO***

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Tomo-chan cosplay

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

Horimiya first.

Tomo isn't as good.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Tomo hears you say that and is on her way to drop kick you

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I'd say fight me but I'd lose.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

Whose cosplayingg me

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

Tomo.

Tomboy.

basically street fighter.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

What going on?

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

you guys need to cosplay Horimiya now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

Who are you addressing?

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

whose current reading Horimiya, has a thing for guys with long hair, and needs to cosplay more?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

Ah

So me and Tom then üòÇüòÇ

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

no shit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

üòÇüòÇ that would be üëåüëå

And not hard lol but if I make Tom become one more husbando he might murder me

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

whooo, do you have TMJ?

sldo lol nice try animenext

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Woooooo
Current cause is unknown they're saying it may just be simple stress \(ouo)/ but I'm stressed 24/7 so it's weird it's affecting my health yo. Like the hulk.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

Do you clench or grind your teeth at all? i have that problem and i tend to do it more if im stresed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Not consciously but they did tell me to get a mouth guard. I was at a party once holding a plastic cup (the fancy plastic kind not the red solo kind) and accidentally held it so hard it shattered and everyone was like "chill out yo" ouo
Stress is my existence you take it away and I am an empty husk

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

yea, I got as mouth guard like 9 months ago, its helped alot with my jaw pain

its only for nighttime but I dont have pain nearly as much anymore

10/10 would recommend

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

When in doubt; you can convince Marisa to do something by relating it to cosplay.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

What anime characters have mouth guards

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

O.O

i do not know XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Won't do it then it's not weeby enough <:dab:370384480613040138>

but but....

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

Weeb life > health

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

i mean, i used to have a problem where smiling for extended periods of time would hurt so like, you can smile longer for cosplay pictures without pain? idk im just grasping at straws at this point

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

"it's not you, I have a medical condition that says I can't smile at you."

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

I'm not going to eat anything at all ever until Konkon so my teeth remain sparkly and I'll probably be supermodel thin

I can live off of water and mouth rinse

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-06*

that... is not a good idea

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

yolo

**Bill** - *2017-12-06*

I will hurt you if you do that. Pretty not taking pictures of you is the same as a stab in the back, so.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

I won't be able to walk from weakness of hunger but I'll reinforce my leggings it'll work out

Like furry stilts

It's like I can feel the breeze on my teeth

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-06*

Though I think they're the kind of person who screen caps everything just in case there's something to complain about.

that's the feeling I get.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-06*

i intend to do that and then always get lazy and don't

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-11*

I was thinking about that. Weiss would need to do the worm maybe.

I think the Adam and Eve we saw at Collosalcon are going though lols

Wait aren't you going though? Go get the pics boy

**Bill** - *2017-12-11*

my current stance on photography is I don't want to sell myself on it.

cause then it'll be a business relationship rather than a potential friendship and blah blah blah.

also child, EVERYONE. Is going to be at Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-11*

Nah, Saikou is a joke.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-12*

OOOO all i could think of was <@!288513265661902858>  with the weiss wig lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-12*

/imagines a room full of boys unquestioningly in Weiss wigs

**Bill** - *2017-12-12*

Only in your dreams.

Then again, everyone loves white wigs.

yeah I dunno about Otakon. Room block is probably gone, given it's been open a whole hour.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-12*

They probably have stuff open but it won't be the hotel connected to the con center, otakon has like 10 hotels under its thing. Or it did at the old location, they even had a deal with the airport hotel like 20 miles away or something.

**Bill** - *2017-12-12*

it's more it's a long trip and a good portion of the inner circle here won't be there.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-12*

Cardboard cutoutsssssss

**Bill** - *2017-12-12*

I don't remember them.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-13*

ok phew that would be awesome

because i mean

they were everywhere

hiding in the shrubbery, waiting for the opportune time to announce that you should stay out of the waterways

**Bill** - *2017-12-13*

Didn't you leave before the lights turned on?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-13*

last year i think i left right around when they were supposed to? it was cold.
these are from when it was like 90 degrees out

**Bill** - *2017-12-13*

Ye, I remember. Totes ditched me.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-13*

I'm going to try and get a hold of the fucks through the main site.

It's the principle of the thing now.

I don't even feel like getting the actual scarf now. I don't have it for Konkon, so I'm going to look like some random instead of a member of the group. üò¢

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Ummmm possibly? But dat a big group

**Bill** - *2017-12-16*

Is there even anywhere big enough at peddlers village

THEY HAVE A MURDER MYSTERY DINER but you need reservations and it's $65 a person

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-16*

Yea true, but plus who ever is in anyone else's car

Like Leanna

**Bill** - *2017-12-16*

Mine was pretty good tho I AM shy so

*shrug emoji* it doesn't show I don't think

**Bill** - *2017-12-17*

As I got know you I had a hunch. Might be biased, I think it's similiar to the way I am.

Shy until you're among friends.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-17*

*finger guns*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

biru i did a sappy now u

**Bill** - *2017-12-17*

Stop I can't be nice with people I don't know well I'll blush and die.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

peer pressure

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

Peer pressure to be nice

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

You've know me like a third of my life I can be nice to you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Bill it's kinda funny I'm seeing all the photographers from Konkon and they're sending me pics back and I'm like oh cool these are nice maybe I'll shoot with them again

And then I see their rates are like 100 dollars for 8 photos and I'm like spITS

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

keep me around cause I'm cheap eh?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Nah cause we best frands üíï

I know you like to make fun of those guys tho lmao

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

nah, you gotta be playing the long game like Tom and Jess. 8 years of friendship building up to free photos for a hobby they started this year.

They think they got me fooled. üòã

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

was our plan the whole time obviously

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

especially with the part where you hated anime.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

yup, just makes it that much more believable

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

But to their credit, they're probably better than me. I wisecrack to Marisa and Andrew about their rates cause at least I've got that on them.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

pls consider me i only charge $5000 per photo

i can go fetch my bad photobucket portfolio anytime it's super easy to reach if you have a strong adblocker and  patience to deal with how awful photobucket is üëå

ALSO I FOUND MY SD CARD FROM ANIMENEXT

IT'S BEEN MISSING FOR 50 YEARS

I CAN FINISH THOSE NOW

art

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

can't blame me for wanting to look like I belong with the group.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

ye it's cs2 üòé

i can get cs5 through my school for free but i'm too lazy to download it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

im surprised it runs on what is that windows 10?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

ye 8)

except the color picker is weird. it recently started acting up so whenever i pick or alter a color it's the secondary color instead of the primary one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

oooo weirddd

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

i'm so happy i found this drive I did photoshoots for some friendos and then was like "i'm so sorry. i lost it. i am a failure." but now I can be like 'GUESS WHAT NERDS LOOK WHAT I HAVE'

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

yaaaaaay!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-18*

biru remember your pictures of flora's sayonara no tsubasa finale ranka
i can finally send her the rest of those like on the stairs and whatnot. beautiful.

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

mhmm.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

Woah! It's the fabled dead bill on the hill pic!

So rare

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Omg

That is art

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

is it just me or does katsu have a butt ton of photoshoots/meet ups?

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

no, it's Katsu.

Katsu *is* photoshoot con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

im so conflicted üòÆ

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

_All RWBY for 72 hours straight_

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

there it is.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

lmao i dont even have a full rwby cosplay yet though XD

*sees rwby shoot, sees borderalnds shoot, sees rwbyxborderlands shoot* wat do

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

you should show up to all of those in a rwbylands, but.

rwbylands is Labinnak's domain.

edit mangaloo.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

theyre technically over the dance infiltratino thing too

I HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO üòÆ

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

which leads to we should plan said cosplay workshop day/weekend/so on.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

*me, peering out of the hole of college that I live in, the sweet taste of freedom so close and yet so far* yes we should

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

Where and when.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

After the 21st 8-10 pm cause that's my last final

Also I work the next two Saturdays orz

But Sunday's are nicu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

tom and i are busy with family BS till the new year

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

I think into January is a good idea, like the 6th/7th (first weekend in January) or the day after ice skating.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Day after ice skating would be nice ya

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

Don't see why not

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

as for where the places with the materials and such as well as space are Georgia's and Tom and Jess's. Georgia's is fairly close to where ice skating is. Not that I can volunteer either of those places, but facts be facts.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

I can volunteer mah house

I have a big work space too

And lotsa materials

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

i have space but not a lot of materials

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Ya I have paints and fabrics and foam so

Also sharing is caring so I'm usually pretty cool about that

I've been cosplaying so long I have a dragon horde of materials tbh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2017-12-18*

i can bring our sewing machine so we'll at leas have 2

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-18*

Huzzah

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-18*

I got Fucking leather

Lots of leather

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

I had figured Georgia would volunteer, but you know. Her house.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-18*

I understand I'm behind but when and where is a workshop happening

Well more when

I assume Georgia is the host location cause like

She always is for this

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

correct, and the sunday after ice skating.

Not... 100% confirmed yet but that's the idea.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-19*



**Bill** - *2017-12-19*

Look at all these photographers getting you guys your photos not even a week from Konkon and then there's me.

üëåüèªüò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

**Bill** - *2017-12-20*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-20*

I won;t be in a catsuit

I'm just going blonde in casual clothes

**Bill** - *2017-12-20*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-22*

yeah it was lmao

yato xD

or he thinks hes a calamity god ya never know

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

Yeah when it ended with "kisses" I was like OH GOD

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-22*

welllll

that part is out of character most likely

**Bill** - *2017-12-22*

I mean, there's a reason I didn't mark interested.

Looks kinda... sketch.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

Oh no weebs

**Bill** - *2017-12-22*

sketch is the wrong word, just very amateur.

which i suppose, everyone has to start somewhere.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

Still hurts my soul a little tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-22*

its like the type of weeb that has decended sllightly to the 3rd layer

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-22*

i thought yato was a god of luck
time to fight over anime opinions

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2017-12-22*

i mean the series at least starts with him  as a god of calamity

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2017-12-22*

it starts with the tale of a simple handyman

**Bill** - *2017-12-22*

So I'm reading a photography article with some links to free resources. I look at the home page of the site, which sells I dunno, photography tutorials and stuff. 

Out of the top four guides this site has, two are Boudoir: Workshop in a Book and Fine Art Nude.

chatham station has a nice gazebo outside it. It's bright enough today I could see which station it is.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

Aurri Photoshooooooot!

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

Actually.

Jess and Tom, you'll likely want pajama versions of Nora and Ren. There usually pajama parties in the evenings right <@!245270932602486784> ?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

But then whatever shall I do with these perfectly good Ruby PJ pants?

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

I didn't know if anyone told you okay, gawd.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

Oh no one did

I was just wearing these the other day and Tom was like "aren't those Ruby's pjs?"

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

They are tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

Got then for Christmas like 2 years ago

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-02*

Does ren have PJ'S?

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

Probably?

yeah, he must.

Check the third (i think) episode where Nora and him are introduced.

if Ethan has a patreon... does that mean Ethan is going to do a lewd tier?

o0

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-02*

*pull out cash*

*puts cash back*

**Bill** - *2018-01-02*

I actually looked. ~~there's a lewd tier~~ None of the tiers have anything to do with his business. It's all about twitch streams and facetime with the creators.

I thought Rebecca was the photog?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

for?

ohhh i think they are both photogs and cosplayers

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

both

i think

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

ye both i did a mini creep

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

I'm sick of having a backlog.

for photos.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

Sorry friend ;/

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

I just need to... take better photos.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-03*

That is unrelated and wrong

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

on the contrary.

If I take better photos, they'll be properly exposed in camera. if not properly exposed, properly lit so that all they need is an exposure hike.

Nor will I take 17 photos of the same thing (in actuality I tend to do bursts of three) which will speed up selection.

I get the feeling I'm going to want to drink well at Katsu.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-04*

OH YEAH everyone's at magfest now they had to drive to snowmaggedon to reach it but most made it yehaw

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

God I hope it doesn't snow for katsu

<@!184437198865563648>  <@!351785752197201920>  did we ever decide if we are taking the monday after katsu?

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I have the day off either way.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

ok so really its up to tom then, and a hotel room

on one hand its one less vacation day I have to use but i dont now if tom will want to drive on sunday

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Gotta talk about cons overall. I want to know if I should book connecticon.

When I get back home in 20.

I'm going to put all the con fridays for the year now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

also need to know to take off on thursday for katsu

opinions tom?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

Hmm I don't really wanna pay for another day but also driving back Monday would be nice

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

well... yea lol and we are driving down thursday?

we have rooms thurday night right?

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Hal has a single room in the Gaylord, everyone is pretty much coming down from both room Thursday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

mmkay, so <@!351785752197201920>  when do we wanna leave thursday?

as is do you want me to take that day off

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

Wait so everyone is coming down for both rooms Thursday, is there 2 rooms?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

we have to coordinate this with Georgia and Hal.

Monday on the other hand. It does make a lot more sense to leisurely come back then.

We don't have to stay in the gaylord either, we can find a cheap, more removed hotel.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

yea especially cuz i know how wiped tom is after a con and i prefer him not driving dead

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

Ye, also we gotta get Hal some money for dah hotel

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

gib da man da money

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I don't think anyone in his room has paid.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

ye but we're responsible at least we try to be

also didnt you wanna get some stuff on the car done before then tom?

urghruhr now im getting stressed

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

I have a room at the gaylord for thursday night through sunday checkout

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

does Georgia?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

as of right now everybody has said they're coming down thursday
nah hers is friday-sunday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

oh shit

welp cuddle puddle

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

Lol ripppp

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

lol were gonna die

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

definitely a need for another room then.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

i mean if you stay in my room on thursday you have spots set aside for you by virtue of your position in my room (all Intended roommates get a spot prior to unintended)

but if it looks the way it seems, georgia's group will come with three, then there is you three, then mak and I. 
If Jackie and ryan also decide to come, it'll be 10 people, so rooms should do a 5/5 split

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

we might be able to add another room unto georgia reservation for thursday?

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

if the other room is in the gaylord.

Georgia was holding back because of the cost of the Gaylord thursday.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

^

plus originally it was only gonna be like 6 people coming down thursday

and they were a mix of our two rooms so it was like not a problem

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

opps üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

This is weird cause of the way the room and cars are split, it's not like Tom and Jess are going to go to another hotel then come back to the gaylord.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

yeah, anybody who hopped into my room should probably just stay in my room for simplicities sake, though it will probably be more expensive

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

point is if there's a non gaylord reservation for thursday the cars don't even split the way the rooms do.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

10 ppl in one room gonna be hell though i wonder how much additional night is

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

10 people in one room isn't possible, unless we're literally doing the sardine thing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

10 people in 1 room is possible, its just not fun

also if theres a non gaylord room why are you worrying about cars

everybody parks near the gaylord, loads luggage into my room, then those going to the other location only need 1 car to get to the other hotel

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

I rise from my sick slumber

Anyways I was gonna bring my air mattress

I mean I guess I could call the Gaylord and see if they still have space Thursday to extend my booked room

But also

A lot of peeps in my room agreed to a certain price already

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

they agreed to pay for friday-sunday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

Yupppp

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

if they want to come for thursday it should be obvious that they'll pay more

Charge the thursday room separately, that what I'm doing

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

true, people way want to come thursday because all of a sudden they can stay in Hal's for free.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

nah they can't

my room costs are split for friday-sunday and the Thursday Night is separate,

people in my room doing the whole weekend I'm telling a lump sum, but if anybody outside is joining in I'm asking for the fair share of 1 night at the gaylord

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

but does #everyone know that.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

they should

Its what it says in the cosplan doc and its what i've always said

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

i mean tom and I are good forever whatever we owe you

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

"Hotel Rooming: 
 Room #1:  Gaylord (Halim, Jackie, Mak, Ryan, Jess, Tom) [MAX CAPACITY] 
(Hotel cost: Friday/Sat/Sunday kids: 91. Thursday night visitors pay an extra amount based on the $210.00 divided by # of people there)"

straight from georgia's cosplan google doc

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

I'll talk to my peeps and see who's coming when

Cause Tristan was gonna hop in my car for part of the drive

And roman and reiley were coming with me I think

Though roman has never ridden with me before so that's weird

Another problem, can you park in the Gaylord parking lot if you're not checked in yet?

I think maybe I should just try to extend my booking another night cause this is looking to be a major hassle

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

i just parking panda'd it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

is that cheaper than staying at the gaylord?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

usually

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

What were we thinking about? a garage?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

to park 4 days at the gaylord (thursday, friday, saturday, sunday)

its 120 before tax

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

compared to parking panda?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

where I got parking down the street is 91

so its like a 30 dollar difference

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

hmmmm

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

i saw a garage that was 20 a night

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

yeah but can you get a confirmed spot in it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

you can reserve ahead of time

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

check for reservations soon then

cause it tends to fill up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

good idea

<@!351785752197201920>  we gotta do the parking thingy

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

yeah we figure that out tonigt ye?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

after cleaning the house and shopping rip

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

cool, went out on lunch and got my beer and thread and a seam ripper

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I need beer.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

i got beer, come over and help us clean XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

naaaah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

tfw no one in your car wants to answer theIR MESSAGES

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

That's cuz they not part of the LIT AURII DISCORD

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

ditch em.

kidding of course.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

bae did you mean tfw you need Jackie to confirm if she's in your room

cause if she isn't you can steal bill

fuck she is in our room

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

<@!245270932602486784> come in our car insteeeaaaadddd

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

true though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

you can help me cue music and hand snacks out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

i committed to driving roman and reiley and tristan tho

like i REALLY want to but bluh

and it would make sense cause roman and reiley can go with geoff and justin

_tho boy golly gee i wish they would answer me_

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

> "cue music" 
> You misspelled "play Weezer on loop".

well, if they don't want to pay the cost for Thursday, they'll have to recoordinate rides so they can come friday instead...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

thats fine

yushhhh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-05*

The meta plans

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

i think with your car tho the concern is space

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

its got trunk room lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

how big tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

bily packs like nothing

i mean yea your obv gonna have more room in your truck lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

I think you have more space than I do in the trunk, but if it's needed I can drive it now that's not a solo drive.

I'm not exactly volunteering yet, but.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

you and tom could split drive

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

too late to staff zenkaikon anymore i hope you all signed up <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

but up to you

oh yea we toootally did marisa

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-05*

(^u^)/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

real talk tho if these hoes dont answer me

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

we need to legit go through woodbridge on the way XD

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

oh, but we are currently looking at heading back monday instead.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

for once I'd say skip school and not follow up with an ignore me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

//has three classes on monday

poop looks like im still drivin

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

well we don't have set in stone yet either

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

true.

Though that's what, second week of the semester? You'll live, especially since it's a one time thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

ye but she also missing classes on thursday and friday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

yeaaaaaaaaaaaaah

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

for the glory of the Gazebo lord.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

noooo its ok ill keep driving with the hos

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

don't rule it out, just see if it comes an option.

we'll figure out the rest.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

ya but skool

if i miss monday ive officially skipped 6 classes orz

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

if u wanna come with us well go home sunday if not well stay till monday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

i gotta see if these hos answer first

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-05*

as long as that cool with billy and tom

yeye

just as a backup

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

but if youre coming home sunday then yeah it would work for me

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

it's a moot point if you're still driving the rest of them. Solve that first.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

like i know roman and reiley can theoretically go with justin if we wanna condense cars

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

Saves money. That argument aughtta be appealing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

tristan is the only one im not sure of, and hes on the way in the last two hours of the drive

cause he lives in maryland

yeah i think im still driving

sorry bois but at least you can stay til monday now

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

so long as our nonexistent plans aren't the cause.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

Nah i cant abandon tristan he doesnt have another ride

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

He has a car, he used it for roller skating.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

yeah but bluh then he would have to pay for parking alone

**Bill** - *2018-01-05*

My car can do 5, has before, but that's up to everyone else. I wouldn't the one crammed in the back.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

where's tristan from

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

Forest Hill, MD

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-05*

maybe I can grab him on the way

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

well if justin isnt driving down thursday i cant put rei and roman in his car

which he might not

im checking tho

NANI THE FUCK JUSTIN HAS A FULL CAR ALREADY wow ok guess im driving

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-06*

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I mean, unless 7 at Katsu isn't literally hell, but then we'd be talking 8.

Slightly crazy.

I just checked if I could add a room, they're still booked out.

<@!351471675843411978> is this for Justin and Rayna?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Probably going to be the same group as last year, plus a Georgia and a Hal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

Nice üëåüëå

John Arron and Andrew too?

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Probably?

I mean, yes for Andrew of course.

I haven't heard from John or Aaron in quite awhile.

They're still in for Zenkai, last I checked though, so I can't imagine they'll skip next.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

Ok coo üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

So what's the Anext room plan

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

course Aaron has also made the decision to be a NEET recently, so....

I've got two rooms thursday to sunday.

We had 8 last year.

Beyond that?

Dunno.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

Does Sheridan have joint rooms?

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

They do and we should have got one last year, but we had the fiasco thursday.

I'm calling to see if I requested it when I booked them now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

Sweet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

What a relief that someone else manages hotel rooms for once

I used to have to do it all the time

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

Billy is best hotel managerüëå‚ô•Ô∏è that being said we could take a turn

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

lol is it something you *want* to do?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

No but I feel bad you always do it

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I don't mind.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Bill has Organizing‚Ñ¢ in his SOUL

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

Best thing you can help me with is watching the sites so we know when we're able to book the connected hotels.

Which is the *only* reason I've used twitter.

Besides. I get 3x points on travel expenses with the card I got recently. üòõ

Granted, I don't think I can book con hotels with Chase, but I'll figure out a way to turn those points into good.shit.

Such as getting a hotel near Gen's possibly for nothing, as I do not want to drive there and back in one day.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Yeah you were thinking about that return party too huh

That drive looks like ass

Not gonna lie

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

To next?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

To Gens for a partay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

Oooooooo ok

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Ya I wasn't sure about going between gas cost and the time to drive

Plus that weekend is my turn to visit hal

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I mean, I don't think I'd go if you two didn't.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-06*

Like I'm waffling on it

I have the day off from work

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

I'd also say carpooling if we can figure out how to get everyone into le car.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

the westin hotel at MAGfest is having huge problems and is an awful place to stay right now, reportedly.

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

One of the fate cosplayers is having a shit time.

well, both of the ones I actually got to know a bit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

are they at the westin or are they having magfest troubles

a super mega famous cosplayer (i'm talkin' 18k+ likes on facebook) messaged me on instagram yesterday but it was the wrong person 8)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-06*

Lmao oops

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-06*

<@184437198865563648>  we have to decide for sure tonight which car we are bringing to Katsucon because we need to know for parking permit

**Bill** - *2018-01-06*

It's just us, so we don't really need my bigger car.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Ok we'll get it for ours

Parking has been aquired

**Bill** - *2018-01-07*

Yay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-07*

Dear Katsucon Large Photo Shoot Scheduling,

With the second year of Katsucon's official photo shoot roster approaching, it has come to my attention that there are many issues with the photo shoot system that make it more difficult for cosplayers to enjoy the convention.

Katsucon is renowned for its cosplay. Other conventions like Magfest, while held in the same venue, just don't have quite the emphasis on cosplay culture that Katsucon does. I find that the new photo shoot system clashes with cosplayers organizing their schedules. 

The situation occurs like this: cosplayers must book their private photographers well in advance to ensure that they receive quality photos of their cosplay. This often occurs months in advance of Katsucon, so photographers can ensure they are making enough money to attend the convention to begin with. Therefore, cosplayers have already set aside times to shoot with these photographers. They can pay as much as $100+ for an individual photo shoot, and often have to pay a non-refundable deposit for a very specific time slot.

Meanwhile, it seems that group photo shoot hosts do not announce that they are hosting such events until a month out from the convention. This was the situation last year, and seems to be the situation now. Cosplayers are often unable to attend group photo shoots because of the private photo shoots they have already committed to. This prevents cosplayers from getting both private photos and socializing with cosplayers of the same fandom.

If Katsucon cannot fix the situation, cosplayers will no longer want to come to the convention. The group photo shoot system complicates cosplayers' schedules, so staff can expect to see a marked drop in satisfaction (and returning attendance) of convention attendees if they do not change their policy. Why would cosplayers come to Katsucon when they can't even attend convention events? Otherwise, they would pay for private photographers at lowers prices, closer to home. 

I believe it is best that Katsucon either announces official group photo shoots much more in advance, or remove the inefficient system because of how it is negatively affecting cosplayers. 

From, 
A concerned attendee

**Bill** - *2018-01-08*



Shit we can't go to Katsu anymore.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

all of katsucon is cancelled now guys

**Bill** - *2018-01-08*

spoiled it. spoiled it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-09*

are they having a furry meetup. katsu usually always has a furry meetup in that one hallway near the gazebo

i can't find the meetup but katsucon had a booth and was advertising at a furry convention. they want the furries.

why is the group that runs j1con having a press conference. that sounds really random

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-09*

whaaat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-09*

they announced a press conference on facebook as a way to announce upcoming events I think? like cosplay prom and this year's j1con and other random stuff.

war flashbacks to when their con was called "anime experience" and was literally held in a massage parlor. the video game room could only fit 3 people because it was literally a tiny private room with a massage table.



Who going

**Dave** - *2018-01-09*

*spit on deh non-believahs*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

<@!351785752197201920>  do you think we should buy 2 of these to sleep on at katsu? https://www.amazon.com/Inflatable-Swimming-Pool-Mattress-Raft/dp/B00005CA6C/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1515618856&sr=8-2&keywords=pool+float+mattress

that way we can move them aside easily during the day and its not as big a the regular air matress

feel like it would be easier to pack too

**Dave** - *2018-01-10*

anyone remember when colossalcon tickets went on sale last year?

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Think you can already get them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

I don't think so

**Dave** - *2018-01-10*

nothing on the site

just trying to get an idea what month it would be, have to see if my cousin wants to come

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

Yea idk what month cuz we heard about it after tickets we're allready for sale

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-10*

Colossalcon tickets are on sale now :0

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Oh they announced the date.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-10*

East?

**Bill** - *2018-01-10*

Colossal east.

**Dave** - *2018-01-10*

east is not

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-10*

Ooo

**Dave** - *2018-01-10*

the site says they still have to add the info

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-10*

Regular colossalcon is on sale east probably too early

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-11*

<@!351785752197201920> <@!184437198865563648>  car pool this weekend?

**Bill** - *2018-01-12*

Yeah.

I'll drive if you like, you guys have driven a lot recently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-12*

Thanks bra üëåüëåüëå do you want us to come there or do you wanna pick us up?

**Bill** - *2018-01-13*

I'll come to you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-13*

I'm gonna say leave about an hour and half before from here so 2?

**Bill** - *2018-01-13*

<@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> our route down to the rink is like literally past your house Georgia. If there's an interest the 5 of us could drive together to the rink.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-13*

HELL YE

What time can we expect you

**Bill** - *2018-01-13*

<@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> you good with space requirements for cosplays? Everyone's doing a casual afaik so I wasn't thinking it's a problem.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-13*

The trunk should be enough space for all our stuff <@245270932602486784>  should we bring air mattress?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-13*

Yeeee it's probably comfier to do so

**Bill** - *2018-01-13*

Kk, something like between 3-3:15ish Georgia. You guys cool with leaving closer to 1:30 than 2?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-13*

Should be ok

**Bill** - *2018-01-13*

Kay. I'll let you know when I head your way.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-13*

45 might be better

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-13*

UHHHH yeah we'll get cosplay on now

**Bill** - *2018-01-13*

Yeah, that's more like it.

On my way out.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-13*

Ok just come in when you get here

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-13*

ETA?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-13*

3:02

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-13*

Yeet

The way things go prob 3:10 Les be honest

**Bill** - *2018-01-14*

Should we be recruiting to BNE? <@!245270932602486784> @therest

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-14*

Maybe

I'll explain later

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

ooo the zenkaikon amv contest is open. should i finish one of the videos i have like 90% done and submit it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

I feel like you've said this before üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

probably but it wasn't open before ;3c
y'all should enter too what amvs do y'all like

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-15*

I've only seen 3 code geass and 1 toradora amvs

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

you've only seen 4 amvs in your life?? wat

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-15*

Yeah actually

Maybe like 10 tops

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

does jess know this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

Lmao I haven't seen many either

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-15*

does tom know this

what a scandal

i like amvs but they're better when watched in a big audience so you can hear the audience reactions. deuce has been uploading a bunch with audience reactions from con contests he runs, like zenkaikon. some are golden.

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*

Much katsu crunch was done today, thankee for the hosting Georgia. üòÑ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-15*

Yeeeee, good shit !

Everyone at least got a little done... Some more then others

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

Yes thank you Georgia! I got so much done today  and no longer feel lost!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-15*

üôè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

yeeet im glad everyone could be productive

Today on the Katsucon Facebook group:

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

*goes to find post*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

_gathering_ not a _panel_?

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

I'll save you the time, those 13 comments are people into the idea. There was an event link in there too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

Gathering sounds sketch panel would be more legit

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

Well, little late to run a panel.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

True

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

Cons in less than a month.





I asked Jess(es) for these since I'm never in photos. Passing them around.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

Oh hai dat me

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

~~photoshops undesireable out~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-16*

Savage

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

you didnt see it from me

**Bill** - *2018-01-16*

What, Sakura-San?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

_i said no such thing_

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Truly savage.



Haaaa cringe.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

<@!288513265661902858> do you want to be my "date"?

(Pic for attention)

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

They have that wristband system now which is mega helpful

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

I don't think I'll get a wristband

I have too many friends and Hal to dance with

I don't need no randos

But also hmmmm random RWBY people tho I might need the wristband for

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

i want to see the dance queen from last year. her dress. so fluff.

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

nani?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

the dancing queen
young and sweet
idk how old she was but floof

this her

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

No, the wristband thing. Cause I don't have a date to the formal and quite frankly wondering if I'd rather drink and rave.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

If you are available to dance then you can pick up a green wristband

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

you can grab a green wristband which signals that you're open to dancing ye that^

if u a girl i recommend keeping friends nearby

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

To let people know you are open to dancing

I will not be getting a wristband üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

THESE PEOPLE WERE SO GOOD

i miss katsu someone take me with u

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

Come baaaaack

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Yeah, Marisa's comment sums that idea up pretty well. Probably ends up all about the cringe.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

i had 4 dances last year. 3 were cringe anD ONE WAS GARY AND I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM. I WAS THE CRINGE. I'M STILL SCREAMING

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

Who Gary?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

the old president of the anime club i'm screamin

i have the facial recognition abilities of a goldfish he wasn't even in costume

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

Lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

ooo nance just opened katsucon booking. ***i wanna go aaaaaaaaaa***

maybe crunchyroll will livestream it they used to do that

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Wait, Rowan Gary?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

waIT NO CRUNCHYROLL IS BLOCKED HERE I CAN'T ACCESS THE WEBSITE AT ALL IN THIS COUNTRY

ye

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Damn, savage.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

if u see him dance with him he super sauve. but he mentioned getting married i think so you'll have to fight his partner

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

Anyway, yeah. Wristband thing sounds cringe worthy. I try real hard to not be cringe thanks. Interest in formal continues to dwindle.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

if u get a wristband you have to wear a fedora and ask girls to dance by calling them m'lady

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

The wristband thing is actually pretty common in clubs and things too

Tom said I should get a wristband just so I can can stand alone, wait for guys to ask me to dance and then tell them I'm married and walk away

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

u gotta cosplay a character that would match that level of harsh

step on their dreams

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

That's savage.

With my luck that'll happen to me.

Definitely nope.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

BILL NO YOU CAN DANCE WITH BUDDIES

also Jess tom is correct that's hilarious

I'll get a wristband so RWBYS I don't know can befriend me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-17*

have a blockade of amigos who only let rwbys through to the famous Wezrez Cosplay, or teach hal kung fu so he can fight for u if anyone else approach

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-17*

O yeah hal is a ninja he can fight anyone

I will dance with all the amigos

It'll be fun

We can do awkward dance circles for the fast songs

**Bill** - *2018-01-17*

huzzah, I have time off approved for Katsu, Next, and Colossal.

and Zenkai.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-17*

nice

i still havent put in for katsu :/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

I officially got off work for Katsu yesterday yeehaw

ive been transfering and getting transferred money for katsu today

i feel like some kinda crime lord getting paid off

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-18*

that's laundry and it's illegal

**Bill** - *2018-01-18*

I can get you that whenever.

Just tell me how.

Does katsu do anything special for Valentine's Day given it's the weekend after? I always thought that timing was weird but let's be honest what's more romantic for you nutters than taking photos in wigs.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-18*

A lot of cosplayers give out Valentine‚Äôs Day cards. To people cosplaying the same series or in lieu of business cards.

I got a ton of ladybug valentines the year I gave out stickers

And also one handmade bracelet dang

That mostly happens when Katsu is during Valentine‚Äôs Day but that happens so often people will probably bring valentines anyway

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

i wanna bring valentines

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

Hand them out to all the cute 9s's then I'll go and try to steal them back

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

YES

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-18*

That would actually be adorable

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-18*

no i gotta make a corny valentine for all my cosplays

me: "thats a fairly short packing list right?"
Packing list it 3.5 pages
"ok maybe not"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-19*

i got an annual passport to the aquarium because it was only the cost of 2 visits so while you're all at katsu i'll be sobbing and taking selfies under the aquarium gazebo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

AQUARIUM GAZEBO NO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

<@!351785752197201920>  and <@!184437198865563648>  should i take off thursday, friday and monday completly?

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I'm doing thursday as a work from home.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

i don thave that option

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

that said, I can work from the car if you guys want to leave earlier in the day.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

i can take a half day or a full day

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

working from home is my half day option.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

are we still planning on getting a room for sunday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

half day thursday, full day friday

humble recommendation

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

You could always skip class monday...

Georgia: *If you guys get down to Katsu before me I'll be jeaaaaalousssss*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

assuming traffic is BAD and it takes 4 hours

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

I honestly have no freaking clue what we're doing towards the end of katsu

When do we have the parking spot til?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

uhhhhh 6? i think

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

We get a room, we relax sunday night, we leave when we want to monday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

id do a half day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

^^ im doing half my classes thursday

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

Monday is the one thats up in the air

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

we could probably leave home at 1:30

well do you wanna drive home dead?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

so we'd leave sunday night?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

or monday

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

or afternoon

are we doing anything fancy on sunday?

is there a reason to stay late?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

more convention time?

idk how billys hpotoshoot schedule is either

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

I mean tbh I dont really care ill drive home sunday, if you guys wanna stay late into monday thats up to you just let me know

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

see you say that now but i can allready hear you waking up sunday and being like "ughhh i dont wanna drive"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

oh yeah but ill say that monday too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

and for the rest of the con

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

We can do something in the evening, have some dinner, sleep *not* on a floor, then leave while the sun is up monday with a decent night's sleep.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

yea but we can sleep better on sunday night than we will all weekend

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Remember, the formal *and* rave are saturday.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

Im not going to both üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

i think its safer to drive home monday

üò¶

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

we can but we need to get another roomm then

so get on that bois üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

imma a girl

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

and a place to park

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

If Katsu's anywhere near as good as Otakon (which it should be) you'll be pretty dead inside sunday. God the drive back from Ota sucked.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

could get one further out of the harbor if you want so its cheaper and away

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

i dont even remember the drive back from ota i was so tired

but katsu tends to be less miserable

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

billy do you have any kind of rewards thingy with hotel chains? or AAA?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

ill probably be leaving by like 2 or 3 on sunday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

id love to like actually go see DC on sunday evening but idk if that would be possible

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Mhmm. Folks have triple A, I've got the chase rewards gig.

What would we want to do in the evening?

That's the only question, cause book somewhere in that area.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

never forget that the gaylord has a bar

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

i mean id like to go see DC but idk if <@!351785752197201920>  wants to do city driving

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

lmao more like do you wanna do city PARKING too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

that too

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

DC isn't like NYC, if it helps. It's got wider roads than sparta. Super weird.

still, there should be things in the area that wouldn't be so bad.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

yeah DC is bigger roads but the street plans for it are ASS

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

it'll be daijoubu.

Georgia just trying to convince us to not have fun without her. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

answer the other question first, what would you like to do sunday night, if anything.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

I DID answer that but tom need to weigh in

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

whos sober and wants to drive around national harbor............................

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

what is going to see DC tho?

Cause I've never been, asides from the hotel Ota was at.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

go to the big rectangle thingy

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

the washington monument?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

yea and the reflection pool and the museums

and the white house

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

*isn't that occupied by super mutants*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

ye boi

like thats all i know ive never been to dc idk whats there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

FIGHT THE SUPER MUTANTS

theres the pencil

and the air and space museum

and the capitol building

and the library of congress, i like that one

and the supreme court building

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

the drive from gaylord to that hotel i sent doesnt seem too bad

then maybe uber into the rectangle? toms doing that thing he does where he ignnores making plans again

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

_puts the visa concerige to work._

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

Yeah there's alot to do in DC that is cool like the museums

But

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I'll see if they can dig anything particularly cool up that's not too much effort after a long con weekend.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

but?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

I still don't wanna drive into DC and park if I can help it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

well the hotel i found is just off the highway

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*



clearly that's what we need to go to.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

oh boy

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

***clearly***

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

_blaze_

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Two notes: Presidents day weekend means either 
A. the memorials will be packed with tourists
B. the memorials will be packed with protesters of some kind

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

oh tru

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

And it's still going to be le cold, so walking outside extensively is kinda nah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

that too

we could find something lower key to do too

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Museum is decent idea, we could always go barhoppi---gak

^ Tom strangled me right there.

that was the joke.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

how dare, why are you impedeing toms bar crawl, in search of the perfect glass of water

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

says the one who needs to get a fake or something by colossal east.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

we keep drinks in our room too ya know

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

tru.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

ughhh this whole thing is stressing me out

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

the hotel?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

hotel, what we are doing, taking days off

did you ever add on thursday <@!245270932602486784>

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

we're taking off monday, I'll book the hotel (have to in order to use chase rewards), so just find something you want to do or wait for me to hear back from the concerige.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

i did noooot because i already charged everyone for the room

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

oh wait shit, that's an actual thing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

im actually baffled what were doing for thursday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

how much is it too add thursday?

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

200 approx if I remember right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

yeah

210

plus a 22% resort fee i believe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

maybe we should find a diffent hotel for thurday ngiht then? i just dont know how were going to all fit in one oom

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

that was a nightmare with car situations.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

oh right we allready have parking there...

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

and you guys are technically in Hal's room, so you're covered.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

True but still

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

you're right.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

We can in late so I kinda feel responsible

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

this was going to happen without you two.

All of Georgia's room wants to show thursday and not pay for a room thursday.

That's not even you guys.

<@!245270932602486784> Extend your reservation. I'll cover it and if anyone contributes they do and if they don't they don't.

it's the only thing that makes any sense to do.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Bill whaaaat you crazy dog

That's not fair there's probably another alternative

Also the issue is more that only I wanna be there Thursday

But my car is stuckxoming with me

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

The alternative is you ditch them to find their own transportation and come with us.

You tried that, Justin has a full car.

I'm a old dude, 12 people in a room with make very ded. Very dead photographer don't take photos.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

HNGH I'll call later today to extend it when I get to hals

But I'll wrack my brain for a better solution

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

You've have come up with one already.

You're a smart cookie, you knew just as well as I do.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

I'm ~~Afina Tyndall~~ a smart weenie so I'll think of something

That's a last resort plan

And even still, I'll pick up a few extra hours to pitch in

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Don't worry about it. I'll be pissed if you end up not finishing a cosplay because of that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Nah my to do list is pretty short

Theoretically, I'm at that point where 24 hours of solid work cause finish all my cosplays

Perhaps not to the level of detail I want, but I could definitely finish/skip out on remakes

Don't worry bout itttt

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Remember why I liked v1 Weiss particularly?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Detaiiils?

And my COOL WEISS PERSONALITY YEAH

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

No, the detail work on the skirt. The snowflake embroidery.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Oh yeah but that was easy

I just combed like three jo Anns for the material

I'm actually sad that Volume 4 doesn't have an edging like that

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

what thursdya is this again'

for what con

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Katsu

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

are y'all getting another room altogether or...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

You have it covered

Katsu

We're gonna try to extend the booking

Why did Katsu send twice what

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

ok

ah then why is  <@!351471675843411978> asking you about extra costs 
I got confused

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

They're staying Monday too with their own plan

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

oooohhh

I'm still confused whats everybodys plan for katsu

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

Georgia is going to extend into Thursday.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

cause I have thursday-sunday and I know Jess and tom are in my room

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

You having your room does nothing for the 5 people in Georgias who can't sleep in your bed.

I'm covering the Thursday, because I'll die if I sleep in a room with 11 people. And dead people don't take pictures. Whatever anyone contributes they contributes, idc.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

i'm confused about how georgia's extension is related to tom and jess's paying for a room

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

It isn't.

Solve the issue of where I can sleep, where the three people in Georgias car can sleep, and we all won't be sardines Thursday night after the drive down.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Tom and Jess are talking about Monday

Anything tom/Jess/bill related is about them staying Monday

Anything me/bill/my car of monkeys related is Thursday of Katsu

I think you scrolled too fast to catch up and got confused bae

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

probs

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

yea i feel bad cuz i know tom and i got added in late so even though we are in your room i feel like i caused a problem üòÆ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

lol nah your all good

you actually took the place of two other people so its perfect

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

still have to figure out what to sleep on, im still liking the pool float idea

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

georgia is bringing the extra blow up queen size bed

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

for her room? i have one too, im just trying to figure how i can pack lgihter

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

not sure, i thought we were gonna sleep on it in my room or give it to some other pair

cause Roman usual brings his giant blow up too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

ive never room packed so im having a minor freakout lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-19*

get advice from the georg

<@!245270932602486784>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Gotta drive but I can voice call if someone tells me how to do it?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

i cannot i am at work lol

but no biggie just give me your wisdom later

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-19*

Oh wait I can send you my generic pack list later tonight

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

didnt you mean more of packing people into a room beb?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-19*

ye

i mean i also want to be conscious of how many bag i have but yea im more freaking out about the people packing thing, i still like my pool floaty idea instead of bulky air mattress

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

@everyone (I should really make a role for the con goers but eh, everyone else has the server on mute by now) ANYC room blocks are 200 a night. Not that I remember speculating on doing htat, but it's of note.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

NYC is a day con ~

**Dave** - *2018-01-19*

üëÜ

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

I could see staying saturday evening and going out in the city.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-19*

fucc the citi tho

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-19*

Rip I'd go to katsu but there's prob no housing left

And no clue about ANYC

Could easily commute from my house tho

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

we commuted this year. Industry con, lots to shop less to do, but we had fun.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-19*

Yeah, I used to commute to NYCC so I assume it's not much diff

Katsu seems a bit far for commute tho

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

It's not a close con.

ANYC is in the Javits.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-19*

Yeah so anyc is legit the same as Nycc

**Bill** - *2018-01-19*

But anime focused and a shopping con, not an industry/press con.

I know I said industry before, my mistake.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-19*

Shopping is fun tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-20*

yeee

the artist alley was no joke ast least in terms of quality

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-20*

**Andrew** - *2018-01-20*

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

The ideas from the concerige.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-20*

OoO

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

Real helpful.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-20*

The dinner cruise is cool but $80 after a con is meh

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-20*

true

**Bill** - *2018-01-20*

that's my thought too.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-21*

Is that Andru
cryptid

**Bill** - *2018-01-21*

<@!245270932602486784> Lissy is Yang Saturday, you can hug her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-21*

YES

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-21*

i can see fire emblem's lissa cosplaying yang

firemblem

**Bill** - *2018-01-21*

Speaking of, Lissy is also Hinoka apparently.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-21*

evolution

lissy's name isn't zoe, is it

i know a zoe who cosplays lissa and hinoka

full circle

**Bill** - *2018-01-21*

....

Her name is Lissy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-21*

lissy should cosplay someone named zoe
f u l l c i r c l e

**Bill** - *2018-01-21*

Tell her that, she's in BNE.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-21*

rwby spoilers is there who's @ everyone-ing in rwby spoilers

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

the gaylord has a rooftop bar wtf

but it has a dress code? laaaame

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

You're bringing a formal dress.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

dress code is smart casual though

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

smart casual is bullshit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

ye boi

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

i mean like, Jeans is smart casual.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

basically the same as business casual plus nice jeans

but like no tshirts

basically my work clohes

sept i can get away with leggings

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

the NYC office is smart casual.

Hence my feet are up, I'm wearing jeans and a flannel.

I still might go though.

Maybe I'll go there instead of the formal or the rave. That's me right there, classy drinking at the bar guy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

Im not allowed to wear jeans or flannel

well if tom sticks to the whole "no formal and rave thing"  may meet you there

sounds neat, ill have to bring a nice sweater or soemthing

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I mean, I should go to the stupid dance.

Gotta meet new people, bleh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

i wanna go. i wish they wern't on the same night

could also check it out thursday

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

easily.

Or friday. Or sunday afternoon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

says only open to registered guest though

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

_shrugs_

we'll find a way.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

so im asuming theyll either want our name or a key card

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

plus the bar is open till 2pm.

None of the Katsu stuff is likely to run that late.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

am you mean?

also lobby bar

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

true and true.

We can bring the minors with us to lobby bar too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

yes!

we can bring the kids XD

uhhh im so hype lets go now

*cosplay isnt even done*

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I *quite clearly* need a vacation, don't you think?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-23*

i still have a rent payment before katsu you know, plus cosplay work üòõ

**Bill** - *2018-01-23*

I have half a dozen shoots to plan, including the one which I'm going to try and really break the mold with and do differently.

so bleh.

I wanna waterpark bar anyway~

(and TECHNICALLY the software I work on rolls out to the Asia Pacific region before Katsu but... meh.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-24*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-24*

**Bill** - *2018-01-24*

That's right. I'm the *serious* one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

How many drink I owe you billy?

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

I'm never going to hound anyone for the tip thing.

Though Chameleon (I should get her name) mentioned tipping, so maybe it'll finally happen.

(Unless you count that dollar Marisa stuffed in my camera bag like I'm some strip club whore.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-25*

*tucks a single into camera strap*

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

*for the vlog.*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

lol that was more of a "lets make sure i but you some drinks at katsu cuz on top of photos you have done alot of things that benefit me lately"

or before katsu ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

I'm going to AC this weekend with Dad and the Braun guys.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-25*

Drunk bill is unfiltered it's great

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Yes, which means I *really* shouldn't be talking to people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-25*

drunk bill kills rica off for us

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

*especially* over text, cause then you don't even have to say the things, you just type em up and send them awwwaaaayyyy

Rica is down.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

drunk texting can get frustrating though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-25*

is she DEAD tho

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

That's what's gotta get sorted out.

Oh I do a bang up job at it and you know it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

at drunk texting?

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Yeah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

oh yea üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

And anyway. I still think I owe you guys drinks/whatever Tom enjoys.

Cosplay glue most likely.

Not the other way around.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-25*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-25*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

and look free cosplay money! lmao

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

It was trying to continue when we got back that did us in.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

yea, which tom told us not to do. See tom just dont stop at the liqour store ont he way home for us this time

turns out a glass of half rum half beer might not be a good idea after like 10 whisky coktails

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-25*

u crazy adults

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

"adults"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-25*

Kurtis tried to play a fighting game with me when we got back and he was not grasping it with that much in him

Then rudely interrupted by SOMEONE >w>

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

MARK is an adult.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

the someone is me

puking and blacking out

annnnnd I dont wanna do that again

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

It was kinda my fault too...

I've got that pretty good tolerance going for me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

yea and to think my tolerance was better then than it is now

so yea i dont wanna get that drunk again. although i am thankful i blacked out for most of the puking

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Yeah, sorry, definitely my fault.

Don't drink as much as me.

There's a lot of me to get drunk.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

haha then gabby came over the next month with tequila and I did it again

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

I still refuse to drink Tequila.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

sept she took care of me that time

i had never had it except  in mixed drinks

but also we had alot of other alcohol too. I get in the most trouble when mixing hard liquors

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Which I better watch out for, after September I think Jen might end up on a mission to get me to.

Yeah, while you can mix hard liquor I don't too much. I at the least stay in either colored or clear.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

yeeee i should remember that next time lol

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Despite the memes, I didn't drink that much in college. My expertise really is just bourbon and scotch.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

I should technically just stick to beer and wine but mixed drinks are so good lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

i'm virtually walking through katsu in my head to come up with spooky spots. did I get them all. aside from like, back hallways with maintenance doors which are spooky in a different way.

if i was rooming with you guys i'd probably get up at the crack of dawn and whisper "Get Woke‚Ñ¢" with increasing vigor until everyone was awake and really annoyed at me.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-27*

Jess would grab you And pull you into the abyss

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

üòÖ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

you two are doing made in abyss cosplays, confirmed. I‚Äôll wake you up for it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-27*

Omg I'll sleep right through it

I'm hard to wake up

**Bill** - *2018-01-27*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

**Bill** - *2018-01-28*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-28*

Fuck my cosplay isn't done but I'm so ready for Katsu

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

Soon ‚Ñ¢



How to not be sketchy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

sketchiest part is that it's only boudoir <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
at least try to hide it behind advertising "regular and boudoir!" shoots

can you imagine how messy hotel rooms would be if homestuck was as popular today as it was in 2012, and people were doing homestuck boudoir. white sheets and grey paint. wow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

EUGH

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-29*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-29*

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

If we're doing lewd, gotta do it right.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-29*

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

So is Connecticon still Georgia and that's it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

bill question

were doing weiss photos after the rwby shoot saturday

can we start doing them before, and use the time after as overflow?

crescentbladed, the ruby in our BNE group mentioned wanting to snap a few photos after the shoot

<@!184437198865563648>

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

I've got Lissy and her Dad till about 30 minutes before the shoot.

You need a full day of Weiss Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

I doooo i really do

i wouldve had more time if the stupid formal was on friday like it shouldve been

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

Half day Pyrrha wouldn't work?

Not that I'm suggesting changing anything at this point.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

i scheduled my shoots so late friday, not really

plus <@!288513265661902858> was already bummed we werent doing genderbent longer

and sakuras busy schedule locked us in on that shoot too

but yeah

i wish i had more weiss time

its cool tho, worst case scenario ill sacrifice single pics to get some pair and group pics of weiss

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

as do I.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

at least ill wear weiss a lot this year

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

well, this was why I wanted to book time in the first place. Weiss is a shoot I wanted to try my hand at specifically.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

awwww im specialllll

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

This being the shoot being bumped.

That said, I'm your friend not your photographer. I know you prefer group photos so if we lose time on Weiss for Snow we'll do that. üôÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

heLLA YEEEE

ill make sure they dont linger too long

single weiss photos are needed too ‚ú®

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

well, you have that other shoot for Weiss.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

truuuue but i know you wanna get singles too

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

<@!245270932602486784> were photos with Ginny happening?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

Casually probaclyb

**Bill** - *2018-01-29*

K.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-29*

**Bill** - *2018-01-30*

Just wondering.

https://guidebook.com/g/o3lmwfyjow5ht1kcaozqsg75s-20171129043232/

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

im feeling the need to make my own schedule now üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-01-30*

I have a schedule for daylight hours.

After that I go where the people go.

There are dance lessons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

i think the only thing i ahve are JNPR, Renora, and PJ JNPR and maybe the Yatori shoot with jamie on sunday

i think saturday is wide open for us

<@!245270932602486784>  did we ever decide an offical time for pj jnpr? i think we talked about thursday night meybe?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-30*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FP43Zv2EXp_yoejh5UKRWj-ONKBMBswei9udyWM1m9o/edit#gid=0

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

ooo ok so it is friday night

<@!351785752197201920> tom was kinda interesting in the tekken tourny but that overlaps with pj time

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-30*

i mean we can do it after the pj party

thats pretty flexible

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

mmkay, im not sure how important it is to him, so i let him decide, we could do it thurday night too, while the rooms are still all neat and clean XD

your 4pm slot says 4am, i was gonna fix it for you but i cannot edit

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-30*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

i mean it wouldnt surprise me XD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

Tis when the gazebo is a little emptier, early in the morn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

yo why is the neir group shoot at 8:30 at ngiht on saturday i e like when i change out of being 2b

**Bill** - *2018-01-31*

I've seen that person run neir shoots before,5$36 suck. Dj masamune or whatever.

*they

And they didn't pick the time, katsu scheduled them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

oh i didnt know it was a paid shoot, and yea i figured about the timing just thought it was ironic

**Bill** - *2018-01-31*

Was it paid?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-01-31*

ohhhh no i didn't see your correction

i thought you were saying it was $36

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-01-31*

Lmao

You didn't bother to send me a rejection though. I dunno why I keep trying to befriend you.

I'm not anymore, but like.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-01*

Wassup here

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

I have a fear that were all gonna get flu at katsu üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

it'll be me who gets it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

im bringing emergen-c and purel

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Throws airborne gummies like confetti

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

YES

please

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

When I first signed on for Katsu, I expected to basically be tagging along with Georgia and Hal all day like Saikou or Otakon. 

We're going to see each other a lot yeah, but from 10 to 5 it's going to be shoot to shoot to shoot lol.

The power of Katsu.

(You guys get all my attention after sundown though, no worries. üòÉ )

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

FUCK YEAH BILL TIME

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

Gen dropped sherry from Sunday (good thing I pay attention of Facebook or I'd have a shoot planned for a cosplay that isn't happening, thanks Gen) but we might do it Thursday, if ~~I have time~~ I'm in the mood.

But she'll be winter Sunday so That might happen and Allyson Hill (Raven, male sun) contacted me for a shoot too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

Oooooo networkingggg

What's Gens new line up .-.

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

_shrugs_

You wanting to know for Weiss Winter?

Cause when in hell could you fit that in.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

üëÄ no, who's asking üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-02-02*

When. In hell.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-02*

No time, I knoooow

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Not that I don't want to do it too.

Aren't you leaving the con at 3 Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yeeeee

Gotta drive home and get back to skool

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

I has shoot at 3... And Gen cancelled her 2 to 3...

I'mma not take on the Winter shoot. I don't want to be caught up shooting and not saying goodbye.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Dawwww I have the parking til 6 technically I could wait

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

We'll see if I like doing this much shooting, honestly. But if I'm going to, Katsu is the place to do it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yup exactly

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

we'll figure it out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

cause Katsu is bootyful

Im just worried it'll be overcrowded

Inside felt packed LAST year, and that was WITH good weather and people outside

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

I'm not going to miss the other group shoots, like FE/Persona.

we'll have our own Katsu. Cause we can do that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

U right

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Literally just... go to the gaylord for a weekend.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

But then we look weird in cosplay without everyone else

Honestly magfest for some reason is less crowded

Idk why

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

I think they're all too drunk to find their way back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Truuuue

Magfest is more adult

It's during winter break, so no missed class too

Nice üòé

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

I wouldn't say adult.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

More adult emphasized

People drink at Katsu but it's like, lower key

As far as I've heard at least

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Katsu is for cosplay enthusists after all. Photographers and cosplayers.

can't do those sunrise shoots if you're hung over.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

You right

So sunrise shoots Bill? :V

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

You realize my shoot chart starts at the hour before sunrise right?

Someone said they ain't doing anything before 11. üòõ

Not that I'm complaining, though more Weiss time options would have been ideal.

I kinda wanna sleep myself.

Will I?

Who knows.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Sunday is honestly the day I need to sleep in

Maybe.... Saturday.... I'll wake up earlier....

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

it's fine Georgia. Too late to do with anything that's not super early, and like I said I don't mind sleeping.

I plan to drink at Katsu.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

Joe went to magfest this year

HE SAID IT WAS PACKED

WOOPS

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Oh noes

Stupid Gaylord

Also you're not supposed to climb on the rocks

But they can't stop all of us

That wouldn't fly if we went to the Gaylord as just us

_maybe I'll just wake up earlier Saturday just cause_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

we werent suppose to climb on the rocks in the pool at collosal either

and what did we do

Chibi dude fell and bonked they head

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

I didn't climb. I stood.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Cause they couldn't stop all of you!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

and they almost got hurt cuz of it

I was trying to be a good boi and not sit on the rocks

>w>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

But did you eventually

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

...

ye...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

_they can't stop every cosplayer_

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

> gets up at 4am
> stands on rock
> "worth it!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

> so tired I forget to wear Weiss, it's just me in pajamas

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

> still end up being great photos

> has lens cap on whole time

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

> screams while canonballing back into bed with hal

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-03*

*doing the Narder thumbs up*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Omg

So Heather invited me to a comic book expo and I think I'm gonna go to that over kindacon

Cause I don't like kindacons venue, it's bad for photos

And it's... sorta seems like a charity case to go? But like fuck it, it sounds fun, and a lot of RWBYS were invited anyways

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Oh wait. Using Georgia? That's no good.

But actually, I don't think that's it. She invited Mark forever ago.

So it's that then sakura Sunday? I'd like to go back to sakura Sunday again. Was a good time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Idk it all depends on how many people she invites

Like if she invited all the Zenkai peeps then it's not, but if it's just me and Mark and some popular peeps??

I didn't plan on Sakura Sunday but I guess I'd be game

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

Hmm. Snooping must be done on this event then.

Make a weekend out of it.

I'm going to drive back home now though, so shenanigans planning later.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-03*

Yeeet

**Bill** - *2018-02-03*

<@!350847001937707022> There was too much going on this weekend but next time I come south I'll hit you up to do something. üòÑ

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-02-04*

Damn no love for me

But hell yeah, hmu next time you're down here and we can do something! <@184437198865563648>

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*



Speaking of panels at zenkai.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-04*

man u gotta have all that panel stuff figured out before you're accepted man

before u even apply for a panel u gotta be golden

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

Why do feel the urge to pack for Katsu allready? My shits not even done yet

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

_shrugs._

I should put on the complete getup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-04*

Yeee

**Bill** - *2018-02-04*

course my primary motivator for doing it at right now is I spent enough buying the crap I might as well.

Direct quotes from steno for Erik's 11th Doctor:

"4. Loosen that bowtie. *Feed your ~~Patreon~~ Sarahah*"

Two shoots left, both Sakura/Jesse on Thursday and Sunday. Le but.
1. Thursday I'd rather take easy, nor do I have any burning interest to shoot BNHA.
2. Sunday I'm pretty busy and want to be sure to say goodbyes and stuff. Even if I end up doing it too, Madoka and Homura poses can be pulled from google images without too much effort.

Urge to not give a shit rising.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

Burning interest
BNHA chara shoots flames 
<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

So you guys change to genderbents I'll shoot David. Easy.

I need to decide on the 5th con I'm willing to take a Friday off for. Or if I can get Gord to let me work a Sunday for a day off / take an unpaid day.

since it came up I checked if there were any cancellations. No dice Hal, can't add a room to mine.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

üòÆ

HOT TUBS

**Bill** - *2018-02-05*

lets be real though, we'll all be sick as hell cause Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

yeeet

yoooo should I bring pillows to katsu? or do you think rooms will have enough to share with everyone?

**Bill** - *2018-02-06*

Should. Only two people are being reported to be in the room to the hotel (they have a fee like at kalahari) so the linens as a whole are likely going to be lacking.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

isnt it defualt 4 though? not 2?

**Bill** - *2018-02-06*

Not at the Gaylord.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

welp

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

Bring! Sometimes there‚Äôll be a spare pillow in the closet but I assume there‚Äôll be like 8 people in the room and more pillows are comfy

I‚Äôm pretty sure each room gets the standard 2x pillows per bed spot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

Idk how im gonna pack all this shit üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

But with the hotel filled to capacity they run out of spares

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

tru... i may have to try to find those space bags

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

The Gaylord is super fancy they wouldn‚Äôt give their guests just one pillow per bed like a pleb hotel

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

I have 3 and a half pages of stuff to pack üò¶ and thats not even toms stuff

im such an overpacker

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

Use a crate

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-06*

You can ask for more

Pillows

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

gotta get there super early though, they run out on thursday because everyone requests more ;~;

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-06*

Good thing we check in Thursday üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

just check in and be like " i need all your pillows"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-06*

Hi yes I need 40 pillows

Why you ask? My partner and I tend to fall off beds and roll on the ground so we need cushioning

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

moving zenkai chat here for any interested parties
cosplay related event registration will open in april for anyone who wants to do that, except for masquerade which is opening in march. gong show registration should be open now.

omg they're just now making a second info table at registration? y'all. we needed that years ago.

they're having a private meeting just to discuss the playlist for this year's formal ball so obviously they're taking that seriously

gopher apps opening soon go sign up for gophers

lastly all guests are confirmed but haven't been announced yet so look forward to more famous people ;3c

(i left out any sensitive info but you didn't hear any of this from me <:lenny:395307171539189760> )

**Bill** - *2018-02-06*

Man, it's no fun if we don't get dirt Marisa.

Look at all the drama that's come through here.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

the most dramatic thing at zenkaikon meetings is the chats about lines
and joe
idk if he was at the meeting but hoo boy did joe stir up some dirt last time.

people bring in binders and posters and literally fight over lines

oh noooo
I just looked up joe and he's returning to cosplay comedy
if you see it on the schedule I don't recommend it. he's no uncle yo.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-06*

when does registration end?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-06*

april 7th but the price goes up feb 21st

since georgia and a bunch of other people were worried about zenkai's ball, I'll say that this year they have a string quartet to play. the head of cosplay discussed some stuff with the old con chair concerning the playlist, and they're going to talk with the members of the quartet about the best course of action concerning the formal. so probably no chicken dance.

here's some samples of stuff they play (edited with better video eyy)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaJ-Wnj7eno

**Bill** - *2018-02-06*

Aaaand I'm turning off notifications for the katsu fb groups. Too much, no longer care.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-06*

but how will we find all the ridiculous photographers

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

None of them can beat Inoue.

And it's not even photographer posts anymore.

Kalahari just emailed me that you can show up as early as you want on check in day and swim before you actually check in.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

:3c

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

that's the thursday you know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

:(c

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

Colossal worth skipping for.

What you going to miss, the group syllabus reading?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-07*

Yeaaaaah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-07*

*shows up in bathing suit *

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

That'd be the idea yes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-07*

Nothing else covering it up

Also shows up at 1 in the morning

**Bill** - *2018-02-07*

water park be closed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-07*

They said as eaarly as I want üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

<@!184437198865563648> what's your schedule Friday morning again, msginnyliz wanted to find a time to snap some photos of our Pyrrha/Cinder

And you mah fav photographer soooooo üíï

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-08*

SUCK UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP

üòõ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-08*

This is a call out post for Tilt Worm and Wezrez‚Ñ¢ Cosplay‚Ñ¢ for being huge nerds and good friends. Spread it like wildfire.

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

it's not because I do free photos? üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

She wanted to plan to do thirty mins and then go over time is need be

She's keeping photoshoots real casual for Katsu

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

so then 10.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

I don't have a steno for that though...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

Steno?

Also the RTX room just got 100% confirmed so we have a room now

ETHANS GONNA BE SO JEALOUSSS MUAHAHA

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

that's good.

Stenos are those planning documents I put together.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

Ooooooh

You got time

Plus Cinder and Pyrrha is like..... how much angst can you do

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

How many of these have I done for Katsu already...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

*volunteers to do it to take the weight off your shoulders*

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

nah, it's fine... I was thinking about redoing Renora in the new structure I came up with for Weiss...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

_will probably still try to find references for you anyways_

I can't believe _she_ messaged _me_ like she's so cool tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

and you aren't?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-08*

**Bill** - *2018-02-08*

If you find time to finish it I bet yours will look a lot better. üòÉ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-08*

Damn work getting busy as soon as I had something to do

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-08*

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Is your room more expensive than the one Georgia got?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

nay but somebody payed 50 to georgia up front

and then left the room

but let her keep the 50

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-09*

hmm odd

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

shit. did we include that when crunched the numbers awhile back?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

yes

you guys kept getting confused about the price difference not adding up

cause you kept forgeting the 50

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

why didn't I write that into the chart...

I need another 5. rip.

We did it right, I didn't update the chart.

I can edit that for you if you'd like Hal.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

i mean

i just took the total cost and divided it by my roommates

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

821ish?

True, I usually did that but with Georgia's group not paying for thursday it required the extra effort.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

no its like 745 or something

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

well I'm confused then.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

I'm confused too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

y'alls expenses are a weird wess

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

well, the 210 a night is static. The 22 resort fee is static. and the taxes can be applied on individual nights or the total and it's the same.

So... I dunno how you get 745. That's not even pretax.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

Double checked, seems I'm actually over charging by $2.10

i checked my room cost

duh

thats how i got about 745

why didn't you just check your total cost

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

that's what it is. You aren't paying a resort fee.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

wouldn't resort fee be listed under "taxes and fees"

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

nope.

`113.4/630` is 18%.

The con must have negotated the resort fee away.

which is doable, apparently.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

maybe
Theres a reason the reservation you get through the con can only be used for 1 room at a time

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

I think that's just for fair play, but.

which means all the numbers for Georgia's room would be wrong, as they include resort fee.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

What's happening

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

either your room is over charging, or my room is undercharging

probably should call the hotel

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Hal's room lacks a resort fee. I'm guessing it's because neither of your rooms have it, and Katsu negotiated it out as part of the block rate.

can tell if you have the same email Hal just screen cap'd

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

its not an email I opened up the room reservation

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Same effect applies.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-09*

ye but the email doesn't include taxes and fees, only room costs

so if you screenshot the email, you'll see a cost of 630

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

I usually call to get the rates myself.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

for da photos

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Ah. Fair.

_looks at your schedule_

_looks at my schedule _

We're all going to be too busy to do anything together the whole weekend.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

what do you mean bill, we have a couple hour time slots together :V

nah sunday is chill

its just friday and saturday, and even then, at night itll be ok

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

I'm shooting 4 on Sunday. One of which is you, though are you doing a change to lineup?

4 shoots rather.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

yeah im wearing breakdance ladybug instead of ladybug

justin quit on me

and ryan and tristan are doing breakdance chat and evillustrator respectively

i could see if reiley wants to be breakdance wifi

theyre still looking to make a line up last i heard...

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

I have no idea how to plan for that one so let's run with it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

just looking like a sick mixtape

or like ladybug and chat noir

its good, its stuff you can do on the fly

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Yeee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

when in doubt, draw your squad memes

**Bill** - *2018-02-09*

Check the room thing when you can though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-09*

if the resort fee is waived?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

Ye. Get the detailed view Hal linked before.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

from the email?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

He said he checked the reservation on the site.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

uh how

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Ask your boi.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

nyooms away to the boi



**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

Yeeee so there's no resort fee in that.

so this means...?

i need to switch around what people paid me, yeah?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

That's the info. Everyone should pay the `Full con` price. I also owe you the total/room for the Thursday.

You need 75 from everyone. Hal need 106.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

Cause tristan and jab paid me 83 each

already

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

frick

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

And I owe you 323.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

ok so the site says 743

-250 cause down payment already paid

=493

you owe me 323 so thats

170

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

Wait what

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

divided by 6?

=28

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

Your room is divided by 7 Hal.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

and jab and tristan paid me 33

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

It's hard to remember, but Tom and Jess are separate people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

so i need 28 from rei and roman still?

ugh never again am i putting a room on my card orz

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

It's not hard if you get the total from the start.

And everyone can be relied on the cost.

And everyone stays through the weekend evenly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-10*

True true

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

Even if there's a partial stay, it's not too much harder once you realize tax can be applied by night.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

Why did 20 disappear from my room?

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

What you need from everyone is 75.

in what way Hal?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

Well 743.4 /6 is 123.9

You said my room cost is 106?

So.... Where did 20 dollars go

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

It's 7 people isn't it?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-10*

Me mak, Jess, Tom, Ryan, jackie

**Bill** - *2018-02-10*

Oh k, I thought it was 7.

I'll redo that. It was based on 7.

**Bill** - *2018-02-11*

Mm, could have a weekend of it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-11*

YEA

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-11*

so the cosplay event today was insane(ly awesome). You have to change at the venue so when we got there the girl's changing room was gigantic. Everyone was lined up in rows and you had like a 1.5x1.5 square foot space to change. No mirrors, everyone brought their own hand mirror. There must've been like 300 cosplayers getting ready each in their own tiny space crammed next to one another. 
Outside everyone gave out chocolate and there were a ton of photographers and one had a stool. he was taking pictures of me and was like "ok put your leg up. hm. no this isn't working. hold on." and just *pulled a stool* out of his bag and was like "ah yes here we go, put your foot on that."
biru u gotta start carrying a stool it's what the pros do.

and then immediately dude gave me the pictures. sd to iphone converter. bruh that's so swag

also stray cats. lots of stray cats.



"Hey Pipimi! Can I take your picture?

...thanks"

**Bill** - *2018-02-11*

Already being recognized as a pro cosplayer eh?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-11*

<@228287793099440128> for the popteamepic cosplayer

**Dave** - *2018-02-11*

Yes!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-11*

also the pinky in the background of the cat pic looks legit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-11*

Ok somehow I've managed to get all all our shit down to 4 bags, that's not too bad right? üòÖ

One whole bag is cosplay shoes... Another is pillows and blankets

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-12*

No need to pack food. Just eat the shoes when you‚Äôre finished with the costume for the weekend.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

lmfao

great idea marisa

when you realise you gotta pay $40 in tolls to katsu üò¢

round trip

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Ewwww

*has ez pass from mom* üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

üò≠

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

I feel like I need to get easy pass, i've travelled through more tolls this passed 7 months then in my entire adult life

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Oops

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

Maybe we can use mine?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

prob not, its gotta be regitered to the car i think

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-12*

i know someone who wound up with like $200 in fees because they had the EZ pass in their glove compartment and it registered every time they went through a toll booth despite paying cash

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

that suuuuucks

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-12*

they tried to contest it but i can't remember what happened in the end

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

It doesn't have to be registered to the car

I think

Yeah it's not registered to a car

It's kinda like a toll credit card

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

It's not registered to the car can confirm

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

Registered to a person

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

Oooo cuz when I googled it it said the car had to be on the account tho

So like you can use one pass for three cars but all three cars have to be on the account

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-12*

I think that's for claims

Like if somebody took my EZ pass

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-12*

Yeah my dad says you can use any EZ pass

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

Hmmm well if your parents are ok with it <@184437198865563648> unless you have your own account?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-12*

**dabs** so ........

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

It's my account. Lemme check the paperwork but we'll use it if we can. Fuck toll booths.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-12*

Cool thank

**Bill** - *2018-02-12*

I just realized that everyone whose dating doesn't realize it for 6 months. 10/10 Gen and Chris are already dating, and they just haven't acknowledged it yet.

The dance lessons require a partner, fyi. saw that when looking for the answer to üîº

I mean, obviously you need a partner to learn to waltz, but the lessons specifically.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Uh I packed the air mattress

So three beds

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Then I don't have to pack anything for that. Helpful.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

just put a whole bed in the car
extreme conventioning

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*



Yeah... no.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

If you die from the flu it's usually due to negligence

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

more like I've put so much money into this con I'm going if I lose an arm.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

Yang is that you

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

My mother just got back from the ER because flu
Unrelated to the ER visit earlier this week

She got the flu from her first trip to the hospital ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

oh nooooo üò¢

omg that sucks is she ok now?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-13*

She has the flu :3c
They gave her medicine and mandatory bed rest until Friday at the earliest, because if they didn‚Äôt give her a date she‚Äôd try and go to work.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

Thank hospital !

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Science!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

wow how the fuck am i gonna make sure everyone at the PJ party stays entertained

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Soon as people start socializing it's fine.

Just have to make sure people don't group up with only their friends.

But rwby cosplayers are both pretty good about inviting people into conversation and joining themselves. The cosplaying helps.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

No candy for Hal and Georgia at Katsu.

They used up their sweet quote with this latest instagram coo fest. üòõ

lol snrk.

I'd say you guys (Tom and Jess) should do the same thing, but I'm kinda betting you aren't in each other's instagram DMs.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

na we are XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

wasn't sure lol.

I barely use the instagram chats cause no PC access.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

Yeeee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

üòè

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

I'm scolding you, don't smirk. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

don't lenny me scolding you, that's weird.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

My dms are prob what you'd think

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

mostly old?

I don't know if this game really does much.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

Yee

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

A. You're dating someone and *insufferable* about it. (IE: the Hal and Georgia)
B. You have a bunch of people you don't know/wouldn't date, which is a boring set.
C. You have a crush in there, but mixed with all the others you could effective just say "I have a crush"
D. You have someone whose DM'd you recently who wants to know what you think of *them*, and it'll help them if you do the meme.

D's the only interesting one.

But it's still vague as hell, because you have no idea if you're still first, second, etc on the list.

_continues to use logic on valentine's day meme._

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

continues to take things way to seriously

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

I'd be super cute too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

tom doesnt do cute shit like that XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

I'm a huge sap.

Just not going to direct it at someone who isn't an so.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

you get 1 super cute thing per 6 months allowance >w>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

üò¶

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

Idk depends on what you think is super cute i suppose lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

üò≠

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

cept yesterday i guess
/shrug

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

Eh. If this is about the story posts, that's a level of PDA on its own though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

ye i was thinking of dat too

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

Although to be honest I could step up my game a bit, I just get comfy :3

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

‚ù§

and nah not just story posts

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Hal and I are only gay as shit cause we're gay as shit people

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Yea, and you haven't been together for almost 8 years haha

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Also probably the biggest factor lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

We also live a hundred miles away from each other

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Also true!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

If you've ever seen us after a week of hanging you'll notice the excessively gay tones down to just slightly excessively gay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

So all I gotta do is kick Tom out for a little while

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

Yeah, but it's more than a little

You need to counteract like

Years of together

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-13*

Hmmm true.... Not worth üòÇ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

Maybe only let him visit on weekends?

The results will be less immediate, but you'll still get to see him

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

I mean when I'm gone for like 1 day or your gone for like one day

the day after were like OMG I MISSED YOU AGH

for like an hour

üòõ

1 day per hour

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

Imagine the effects if you spent a week apart :o 
You would explode in gayness

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

That Lenny implies you might explode in straightness instead

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

lmaooo

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

I feel the need to point out there's no gayness in here.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-13*

I think there's plenty of happiness in here

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-13*

YEEEe

**Bill** - *2018-02-13*

well between googling how to fold a suit and doing things slowly, the duffel I bought really can carry the whole con's clothing.

And dropping the whole 'cosplay' thing.

Boi I like this duffel.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-13*

Cosplay as Bill the convention attendee

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

Question: 
Do I bring my macro lens with me. Facts:
1. Macro lens has got nice background blurring for portraits
2. Macro lens requires me being like 20 feet away to get a good portion of the body in frame.
3. Macro lens requires good light and more than likely stablization for best ISO preformance.
4. I have never used macro at a con.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

YEAH BLURRED BACKGROUND IS SEXY

everything else is irrelevant

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

Eeeeevery time I use this I have the aperture too low (cause not enough light) and we're missing face clarity.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Clarity like "you can see the lines in my contacts" clarity

Or clarity like "it looks like you took this picture with a calculator" clarity

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*



We're so busy at Katsu, taking it slow to get the lens right will cut into picture time...



That's when it's too low of an aperture.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Yeah you can still see the freckles on my face, you're fine lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

(at 1x zoom, which is 6000x4000 pixels)

https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/12344678/android/sticker.png;compress=true

not good enough. Need sharp as tack.

The new camera is making the space in my camera bag real tight...

first con with the new camera.

Follow up:
Do I bring the manual film camera? I love it to death, but I never use it at cons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Nah

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

=/

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

Nah

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

one point for the packlist, after nearly breaking my glasses at Next's rave a spare pair are in order.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

Oh man I haven't had 2 pairs of glasses in years

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

I have so many though, I never lose or break them and Mom could get them so she did.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

Gif of Yuki from blue exorcist opening his drawer to 6 pairs of glasses

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

I've never broken or lost a pair just couldn't afford more than 1 at a time, I could probably get another pair now tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

im sorry 8 pairs*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

If you say so üòè

I want a pair in every color

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

Under the blue exorcist gif of a screenshot of the hero academia manga with Tenya‚Äôs entire wall of glasses



H-how can you not have 2 pairs of glasses always

Wait do you wear glasses 24/7 all the time or are they for when you feel like wearing glasses and having good vision

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

24/7.

I mean, I don't sleep in them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

All the time except sleeping and like the few days a month I wear contacts

I used to get 2 pairs but then my family lost decent insurance when I was in elementary school and didn't get it back till I was in college so I got used to only having 1 pair

Even when I did get 2 I always ended up wearing 1 alot more than the other anyway

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

Ooooo
Ye I always wear one over the other but we tend to be super accident prone, plus cheap glasses frames with super expensive lenses orz
My sister used kids spongebob glasses for a while because they were the cheapest and they fit 
Somehow one of my pairs just started splitting apart for no reason rip

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

Yeee glasses are spence I get them online now so it saves quite a bit of money

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

ya know

it never occured to me that you might have siblings...

odd

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

:3c

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

Marisa definitely doesn't have siblin... ffs.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

I swear, I know nothing about you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

By law

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

I have a sister in law

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

Are they the same person :0

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

I do not think so

Actually.... I have 2 sister in laws? No wait.... 3 technically?

2.5!!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

limited edition collectors version sister in laws. Collect them all ‚≠ê

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

I'm still not used to he fact that Tom's family is my family now and all that

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

but wait... if you have a sister in law, that means you have a brother?

UNLESS YOU ARE ALREADY MARRIED AND DIDNT TELL US

NANI

Jess ... has informed me that Gay marriages are a thing

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-14*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-14*

post day?

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*



This one for the ice skating highlight, but given it's valentine's day I don't want to have anyone thinking David and her are dating.

rip, guess they won't get a limelight.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

My mom knows I'm too prideful to ask for money if I'm running low, so she put con money in a Valentine's Day card

Clever lady

I thought you lost the right to Valentine's presents from your parents when you got a boyfriend but NAH FAM

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

I didn't think valentine's presents were a thing.

Would you rather me send you the room stuff digitally, instead of cash?

Not a problem.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

>w>

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

<@!245270932602486784>

tangentally, what bank do you two use Tom?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Digitally may be better yeah

Just to avoid any issues tomorrow

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

potentially relevant for you then too, what bank do you use?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

Discover

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

that's not a bank, that's credit card brand isn't it?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

also a bank

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

oh waaaaait, yeah, your weird online bank.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

also a gun

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

I don't think it's relevant for you. Various banks are stepping up to make a paypal style, person to person way of sending money called Zelle. The primary benefit of it over paypal/venmo is that it works directly to your account. No wait time while the money transfers to paypal, then to the other person's account.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

My PayPal works directly to my account lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

yeah Discover isnt on the list

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

get me the email for that. 323 Is what I have, one night + the split for the rest.

Yeah, Zelle is pretty new.

chase is one of the founders and I use chase now.

Or as my southern family says "Miss Georgia Lynn"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

RRIGHTTT

I remember you saying that

same as my mom

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

IK ITS SUCH A COMMON MIDDLE NAME cries

At least my first name is spechul

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

yeeeeee

My middle name is Anthony >.>

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

done.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

which is just my dads name

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-14*

*cries*

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

You have a brother named anthony, didn't anyone think that's a bad idea?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

YEEPPP

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

Lynn is common?

since when.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-14*

oh yeah

super common where you been?

like Rose now

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Got it Bill üëç

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

also, you were able to have paypal skip the paypal balance part and just deposit directly to your bank account?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Oh no I didn't do THAT

some people connect their PayPal to just their card

But I connected it to my card AND my bank

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

if you connect it to a credit card you pay fees.

Don't do that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

Yeah I don't use the card option

**Bill** - *2018-02-14*

but depending on your bank you could look at Zelle too. Skips the intermediary.

_personally doesn't like having money floating in paypal limbo._

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-14*

so like, normally, Hal would get me out of bed by saying "its con day"

but recently its become "its post day!" because that happens more often

but tomorrow is con day AND post day

which means i should wake up with the velocity of 1000 suns

All packed, asides from a few toiletries I'll use in the morning and my laptop. Need to get a bottle of bourbon to bring tomorrow afternoon tho. ü•É

Now I just have to find out if I'm going to be on fucking call Friday night.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

Like for work?

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

Mhmm. It's what I was so tied up with this afternoon.

Not that I know how to do what they need.

Not that they gave an appropriate warning period.

Not that I'm not on vacation. (Alright, they did ask, but it's not ask if I can say no I don't want to do the sucky parts. Real world.)

We have a meeting tomorrow to sort this out.

God.

Obviously I'm a tad bothered.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

What would they need form you on a Friday night tho?

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

Emergency support for a thing I've looked at in the last 24 hours during a rollout of another thing I have a loose connection to. New software goes into production at night when no one will notice downtime.

Not that I'm capable of doing emergency support for the thing.

That's the tldr.

<@&413539551424937996> this is a role to tag us, and if you're taking cash out do it before you leave; atms get hit hard at cons. Always better to bring with you.

YOU LIVE WITH IT KID

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

i wear a high waited white thong under mine which somehow reduced the wedge factor since the thong is thinner than the costume butt

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-15*

what if multiple underpieces/leotards
i wore 2 pairs of shorts and 3 pairs of tights for pyrrha because the side slit wound up too high because I messed up the neckline a bit

for the saber I just got I'm gonna wear 2 pairs o' shorts and only 1 pair of tights <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> scandalous

but the tights have thigh highs over them

I thought it was eating a box of captain crunch.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

**Dave** - *2018-02-15*

Don't let them know what we do at work

We definitely do not dab

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-15*

oo Ravioli?!

tell me more >w>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-15*

once upon a time like 5 katsus ago i was headed out the door, literally everything was in the car I was carrying the last bag out. I realized we hadn't packed food for that night. We had ramen and chips and granola and stuff but that's a friday and saturday meal, y'know? so I ran to the fridge and took out whatever leftovers we had. I was cosplaying ranka that year so I was carrying her top hat which didn't fit in the suitcase. our leftovers were all ravioli in ziplock bags. into the hat they went.
that night we dined like kings on hat ravioli

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

were gonna emo out for a bit on the way to katsu cuz i need some mcr today

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-15*

What anime is that from



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

the best anime

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-15*

I will accept hat ravioli tonight

ship me some please

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

but it 5 yrs old

when you boss asks what your doing on your days off üò≥

"oh ya know, goin to Maryland"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-15*

>w>

oh yah know, wearing colored wigs and worshiping satan

might as well be to him lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

yea pretty much XD

if he asks again when i get home ill just be like "we visited some friends"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

That's not even a lie

You will be visiting friends

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

exactly!

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

***Every*** story and post: "Headed to Katsu"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

yuuup

did that spreadsheet for the katsu room say exactly what was getting charged when i got there?

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

_shrugs_

Wait, do you mean mine?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

ye

the thing you typed in discord

all organized and stuffs

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

usually you aren't charged until checkout I believe, but. If you paid 247.80 as the first night's stay the remaining balance is twice that, 495.60.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

ugh i wish roman and reiley paid me earlier then

cause not all the paypal has transferred through yet (which makes me nervous)

so my bank account, with my 180 i had before, and the partial that paypal has sent through already, at 490

im worried it wont all get transferred through paypal in time

i hounded reiley and roman earlier but they were like no i have to give you cash like

no you dont binch

hopefully paypal will come through though

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

üôÑ

we'll make it work. Worth looking into Zelle though, that goes account to account. Available in minutes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

yeah thatll be a good switch for next time

roman and reileys inability to manage themselves is frustrating though

reiley STILL DOESNT HAVE A LINE UP

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

üôÑ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

like theyre a dear friend but disorganized people make me wanna pull my hair out

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

My approach is to not concern myself. You can't make people take care of themselves.

Not going to try my patience over someone if I don't need to.

It might not work for you, you ENTJ. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

Yeah except in this one scenario, their inability to manage money adversely effects me üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

*Well. Don't go into monitary transactions with unreliable people*

Also not a fix.

The actual fix is to go into with the expectation you'll receive nothing.

You'd have to decide if their company is more important to you than their share of the bill. Which sounds harsh, but part of being good company is being good with your debts and responsibilities.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

its true

but if thats the case i can never have hotels on my card ever

i dont have big sums of money to work with; i get paid 100 dollars every other week at best

i didnt WANT to use my card after i came up short money on zenkai too

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

*What's the next hotel you have booked again*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

_none because i aint dealing with this again_

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

And you're staying with us for Next/Colossal. We have to decide on Connecticon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

good point

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

I mean, I guess you did.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

yeah lmao

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

I have to commit the day off.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

after Katsu problem.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

everything except the hotel payment is an "after katsu" problem for me

my cosplay is done, im packed, im just gonna get my cosplay on in the next 2 hours casually

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

_casually checks if he can expand his reservation for Zenkai_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

aw bill nah ill see if i can hop in with rebecca

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

You say that like you're putting me out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

thats just hassle for you to try to do it

and also might not even be possible :/

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

it's not a hassle to do.

It's very easy to do things when you call the hotel.

It's going to be not possible, like it has the last couple times I tried.

But it's 5 minutes to find out and maybe someone cancelled.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

tru

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

nope, no cancellations.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-15*

darn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-15*

If one come up, Tom and I wouldn't mind moving to another room for zenkai so we could have a bed lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-15*

I know.

I wanted two, by the time I went back to book the second it was filled out.

Call every once and awhile to see if there's an opening, that's pretty much the only option.

Could make a post to the Zenkai facebook groups for 'are you cancelling, let me know' but I'm not about that.

Someone else can.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

YOOOO I just found my old trivia panels who's up for anime trivia after katsu

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

I could do decent .. only if it's series I've seen

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

it from all series and some games and some general knowledge
I have hundreds of questions encompassing all

I had to do like 10 questions a week for anime club for a year and then I did a few at-con panels

*tom are you ready to put your obscure anime knowledge to the test*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-17*

Lmao ready

*Posts entire power point*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-17*

some are multiple choice like these two gr8 ones:

```In Code Geass, Japan is designated which Area under Brittania's rule?
a.) Nine
b.) Ten
c.) Eleven
d.) Twelve```

```What is the name of Lum Invader's younger cousin?
a.) Nine
b.) Ten
c.) Eleven
d.) Twelve```

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-18*

C
And didn't see the second ugu

What does it mean???



**Bill** - *2018-02-18*



It fucking begins.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

Get ahead of the game and start asking day 0 of the con if anyone took your picture

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

I'm already asking on the zenkaicon page

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

I'm creating the katsucon event for next year and asking there

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

^

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

alternatively, "hey guys I cosplayed lynn minmay at katsucon 1995 did anyone get my picture"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Lmao

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

Lmaoo



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*



Someone asked for full formal picture?

~~so it didn't have to be stolen from my story~~



**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

You can send me photos I'm in too, when you go through everything. It won't be much but they exist.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*



Do you know de wae?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

OH OK PHOTO DUMP TIME







**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*





**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

That Tim photobomb is gold.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

üëåüëåüëå

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Soooo side note on tim

Do we like him

Cause I don't know where we should be with him

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

I think he's a good, he saved Jackie from passing out drunk in the street at Otakon

Is there any reason not to like him?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Cause that's not what she saw it as

He was fox right

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Ya

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Actual (drunk) quote from Tim:
"Yeah no, I don't remember you."
Me: "Oh yeah, that's okay, I'm Bill."
"Yeaaaah... I mean I don't think I'm going to remember you."

I thought that was funny.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Rei and Jackie were both avoiding him like hell

Because Jackie said he assaulted her at otakon

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Whaaaaat

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Yeah

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Uh in the room?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Not sure didn't really push her for specifics

But like

The mention of it  had her going into nervous ticks and stuff

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

He seemed nice enough to me, but only as a con friend. I'm well known to be selective for real friendships.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

And I was asked by both to help keep him away from her

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Cause we all left her at the rave (oops) and she got shitfaced, and Tim showed up at our hotel door and was like "here's Jackie, she almost passed out in the street but I got her back here". And so I was like "ok thanks I'll take it from here" and Jackie was like "wait don't go" and then pulled him in and sat on his lap and got waaaaay too close for comfort

She kept asking him if he was okay and he was like "I'm fine"

They were both really drunk

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

/shrug

ask Jackie about it I guess then

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Well, what little I know of Jackie leads me to thinking she could be an unreliable narrator?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

While I would normally agree 
The way Jackie acted in relation to it wasn't like

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Yeah so unless something happened at the rave, he didn't touch her at the hotel room

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Jackie ish

Like seeing how she reacted to the mention of his name and stuff is what made me worried, not the explicit charges, though they definitely have the reactions a reasonable explanation

I don't know how to ask her more about it tho, but since it was at ota I figured y'all might know more about it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Who's Tim?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Fox alistar cosplayer

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Does he Cosplay RWBY?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Oooo shit now I remember

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

He also has done a male coco before

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

You know Jackie better than me, so it's your judgement.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Ye he was at roller skating

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

Idk
Based on what y'all say I would say two people were very drunk
I would also guess something happened
And that regardless of if Jackie was actually sexually assaulted, she clearly felt threatened in a fairly serious way

Tbh id need more details

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Sounds like it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*



Wow look at what my Ruby that ditched Saturday morning posted

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

wat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

They didn't even wear Ruby Saturday, they wore HETALIA

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

draw a circle there's the earth

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Rip.

Hetalia is the death sentence.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

their post sounds sarcastic but after several read throughs it's not? ???

are you sure. hetalia fandom now has changed, very unlike the mess it was 6-7 years ago.
especially here it's still huge but the cosplays are top tier and all the US hetalia cosplays i've seen in the last couple years have mostly been competition-level stuff aside from the occasional leftover peak era fan

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

I'm not that serious about it mari-chan.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

*I've written thesis papers on this stuff do you wanna go punk*
pwease someone chat with me about the social implications and unique interactive atmosphere at anime conventions

or rather the way people say it's unique but really it isn't all that different due to the growing popularity of anime and rise of fandoms in the public eye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

Yeahhh day true

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Oh yeah good plan

I like it

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

(Technically I told Georgia and Hal to do the shoulder resting pose)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Little did we know, Bill orchestrated Erik and that girl too

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Nope. I tried to orchestrate him and Rebecca at the Friday Shoot though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Shipper Bill to da rescue

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Didn't... work.

But Lanie blew Erik off for saying goodbye.

So.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

WHAAAAAT

HOW DID YOU KNOW

We saw Erik at mcdonalds actually

It was funny, we were leaving and his car was in the drive thru

And we were like ERIKKKKKK

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Photoshoot this afternoon?

The rest of my shoots went as scheduled today.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

We we're behind Erik in dealers room but he never noticed cuz we are too short

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

O wow that sucks

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

So as for cameleon kid binch:
I'm torn between wanting to give her auto toned/super quick photos to be done with her and never talk to her again, and my integrity of publishing a lazy set like that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

be lazy

then shes happy and you dont feel pressured

shes kept asking, clearly she favors speed over quality

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

mm... that feels like a loss though. For like, my morals.

And she asked in person, then over instagram on saturday (which I ignored) then she followed up yesterday. Is that really enough to judge her...?

Then again, I say I'm a good judge of character and I didn't particularly like her so...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

ya so throw her 2-3 cause, like i said, she favors speed over quality

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

So since we were talking about it on the ride I tried call Zenkai marriott. The person I spoke to had the thursday available and recommended booking it and trying to add each room as one might become available. Collecting them one by one rather than all at once.

Maybe it'll work out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

yeah otherwise ill probably ask rebecca

i only plan on one outfit a day anyways

~~for now~~

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Katsu was okay to kill ourselves over, Zenkai must be more chill. üòë

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

yeah üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Though Tom and Jess say I shouldn't do as many shoots in the future. üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

YE

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

I looked it up yesterday, Each day of Katsu I did as many as I did the whole Otakon weekend.

Whoops.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

yeah i think my line up for zenkai is Erza Scarlet, V4 Weiss (to give her the love/time she didnt get at Katsu), and Sole Survivor

Thats what i THINK id do at least

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

*opens auditions for pyrrha*

While we could get better photos at Zenkai than we did at Katsu... chill.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Ya i was probably gonna bring pyrrha to animenext so the trade off would be bringing weiss to zenkai lol

ill pack formal pyrrha for the formal tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Not formal Weiss? That'd be cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

That 10 mins walking around as jnpr Friday morning were pretty amazing not gonna lie lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

You and I are planning shoots before your adoring photographer fans do Georgia. I want to take those time seriously too. 

And we are planning dinners before the con so we eat proper dinners together.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh

eating at consssssssssssss

ive never been good at that

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

So both of those are happening.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

AYE AYE

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

And vote in for formal Weiss.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Yeah but weiss' side ponytail is so annoyyyyinggg

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Doesn't she have it in the back in one of the concept arts?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

yeah but not in the show

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Hmm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Maybe......... i should try to finish borderlands cosplay for CPAC...............

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

It's in a new convention center, might be good to take a familiar cosplay along.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

well its two days

yeah good point

bill: actually just wants me to cosplay weiss and pyrrha into infinity

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Mm....

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I played borderlands tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

time 2 start playing league so i can cosplay lux

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Don't fall for that lure.

League is bad and ruins souls.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

but i can PLAY AS AFRIN

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

If my salt is a single Grimm the salt surrounding league is the island of Salem.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

i really need to finish my vault suit tbh thats the next project

ive been slowly working on it for like a YEAR

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Did you see that legit Mac cready at katsu?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

NO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Awww ye they were good

If I see a pic I'll show you

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

1. Georgia yes play the leaguesss

2. Georgia we need to sit down and plan what weekends I request off for April and May

3. No pyrrha zenkai ? :c

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

I mean I could do a half day

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

(Jnpr/arkos Ho over here)

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

So did you get an invite to the "RWBY con fam" dinner last night Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Wut dinner

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Oh wow. Surprising.

Lissy asked if I was going when I finished shooting with her, I had similar response.

There was a video of it on someone's story, saw mangaloo, peter, Gen, etc there.

Lissy's story.

I kinda figured it was mostly RTX crew and Casey's people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

I mean I HAD left the con center by then

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Sounded planned, but I dunno when.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

And I said goodbye to the RTX peeps so they must've known

I did see a big table with labinnak on Lissy's story now that you mention it

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Or maybe it was planned at one of Caseys meet ups?

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

It's a Casey thing so I wasn't torn up over it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Ditto

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Good for Tim and Peter though, cause it's probably why she plugged the two of them on her story.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

~~could've gotten an invite if I cared probably too~~

Yeah that's what I was thinking

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

I'm sure you could have.

I figured you did and had to turn it down to drive home.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

noooope

but its whaaatever

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

We'll just steal the idea for BNE. Better community anyway. üòè

They can have their con fam. We'll have our **FLAG**.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

And tshirts!

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

*Technically we've done that before though, after Konkon and after Ice Skating.*

So they stole our thing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

We..... Have made it home....... Whew

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

üôå

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

yeet

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Now burn the purple bag.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

Shit you right I gotta do that

And order a new one

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Noooo unpack it first

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

kermit meme: burn it anyway

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

What

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

what

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

Ya know the purple bag

Fuck that bag

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

what a dick man.

You know, I brought my photo printer.

Never bothered with taking it out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*



So rob and gen hung out

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Supports the whole 'we didn't end badly' thing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

Yeeee

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

That's a nice amount left. Granted, I still have a full flask since we wound down after the formal.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-19*

Lmao Ye u were drunk

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Nope.

Could have been, after the formal.

I was getting pretty happy.

But not drunk. Right <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> ?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Na def seen you drunker I think we both got a good level of drunk this weekend üëå

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Mhmm. Sorry Georgia, still going to have to wait for that one. üòâ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

as soon as i hit 21

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

I usually get drunk drunk when drinking and chatting with close friends. Any other time I'm still keeping my wits about me.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

I can  get you drunk via The Eccentric Tip Jar

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

Got pretty drunk for that fire in September.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Yea me too tho

Sitting and talking I can get fucking wasted lmao

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

I was asleep so don't even remember

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-19*

we'll do a JNPR shoot outside of con and then when we all go out after I can treat you to drinks 
Since it'll be tom jess, georgia and myself which will satisfy the drinking and chatting with friends requirement >:D

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

üôÄ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-19*

Drunk Nora üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

*wait*
People in here are under 21 and we‚Äôve talked about such messed up things 
We have to delet

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-19*

Ye 2 are üòè

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-19*

THIS IS A TRAVESTY

WE ARE CORRUPTING TODAY‚ÄôS YOUTH

**Bill** - *2018-02-19*

They're the ones doing the lewds.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

We‚Äôve failed as role models

Oooo apparently multiple reported cases of housekeeping stealing and throwing away guest belongings

From Katsu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Yea I saw one of those on FB

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

Ooooo boyyyy

We didn't let them in at all lmao

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Did we have the sign up?

Didn't notice.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

During check out before people formally checked out they were doing it too üôÄ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Our housekeeper left us a lil drawing

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

People would run down to their cars and come up for more bags to find it sifted through
Omg really?? What was it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*



**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

https://petapixel.com/2018/02/15/instagram-now-alerting-users-people-screenshot-stories/

rip talking about Erik's stories.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

That fucking blows

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

Lol RIPPPPP,

Now need to take a picture of the phone with another phone

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I wonder if BNE gossips about us the way we gossip about them.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Probably not

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Picture it, Rebecca and Jamie sitting wonder how Tom, Jess and I got to know each other. Audrey asking Mark about something relating to us. Erik pondering at night ~~why do girls love me so~~ if he's taller than Hal in heels.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

And we don't have any major drama or thirsty instagram posts

We're all either in straightforward relationships and or clearly not interested in any of them

Erik is taller than me

Oh wait

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

other way around lol.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Yeah

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I dunno, I kinda want to hear Mark gossiping with people a bit.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

I think Audrey asking mark about us makes sense

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

it's just a surreal feeling. We know there's nothing to gossip about, yet other people don't. So it's possible people speculate wildly about our group.

(I suppose that's always been true, but I can't say I've had this many friend groups overlapping in my life.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

I feel like Jamie and Rebecca gossip about us

and I feel like mark has an untapped salt well

at least as much as you bill

except you aren't untapped

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

I wanna hear mark uptap his salt

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

you probably have to catch him sans audrey

like completely sans audrey

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

he would get salty over social justice or similar issues. We've seen him go off for people giving nerds crap at his school.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

yeah

but I also think he has like 
a secret pool of salt towards just like people and drama

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

yeassss

#giveussaltymark

Imma tell him we want to see his salt.... another day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Keep in mind there is a Hampton inn like right across the street from the Gaylord like same distance that parking garage was from the Gaylord

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

(that is hugely cheaper)

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

is it cheaper?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Not sure what conrate was

So I can't really say

Base rate says $166

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

that would be. Though they may inflate the rate for the specific weekend.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Nvm $260 on a weekend

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

yeah, Katsu doesn't get cheaper while still in walking distance.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Ye rip

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

gotta decide on katsu ideas before they open the room block up I guess.

Any estimate when that'll be <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> <@!301927856240459777> ?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

April

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

probably april

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Summer ish? I think?

April <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Saw a FB post that said staff said april

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

well that's a month.

ish.

I dunno.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

we got ours last year during Anime next

they sell the katsu tickets cheap there

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Rooms Hal, not tickets.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Yeah they sell tickets like the next day

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

no like

we got both at that time

I got the room on my phone sunday of Animenext

cause jackie and reiley kept bitching at me saying I had to do it for them on my computer

and so I passive aggressively did it on my phone

sent a screenshot into our group chat

and was like 
"I booked our Katsucon rooms on my _phone_"

"it only took a few minutes"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Now you have to up it each year 
Book it on a 3DS or wii or a watch 
Then a toaster

One of those fancy fridges

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

i'll do it on my playstation 4

Except #notroomingwiththemnextyear

so its

#notmyproblem

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Katsu isn't booked the day of announcement?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Also take a look at airbnbs I saw one 15 min walk from Gaylord for under 200 a night and sleeps 8 ppl, also has full kitchen so could bring and cook our own food and save $ . Just an idea

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

30 minute round trip on the schedule we (at least Georgia and I) kept would have been impossible though.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

nah they release rooms in groups

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

15 minute walk like 5 times a day for costume changes would eat up a lot of time ;~;

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

and they had rooms easily available april-august

last year

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I'll be thinking about it more tomorrow, but I didn't leave Katsu 100% sold on next year.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

I remember when I checked for a friend they had rooms available in august

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Lots of people are complaining about Katsu
Gimme the drama I need the gossip

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

KATSUDRAMA

tbh The convention center was really nice and all the cosplays were on point

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I'd have to revisit how I'd operate at Katsu. Too crowded to fight for photos. While I'd still book times with people so I can have a proper one on one time to do photos (the distracted shoots are getting to me at times) I think it'll be much less than 17.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

my only comlpaints are HOLY SHIT THAT CROWD

nowhre to shoot

the LINES

and the drive down

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Really? Yeah Katsu lines suck but with a little searching shoot spots have never been a problem. Unless you‚Äôre a big group then rip

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

It wasn't lines, it was just such bad foot traffic.

Everyone's said this year was ridiculous marisa. More than the last years.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

Yeah i havent been to others to say but it seemed insanely packed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

The gazebo is always crowded but other spots people are good on sharing 
:0 I wanna see it aaaa

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Shoulder to shoulder everywhere on the lower level.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

The ceiling leaked at some point

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I don't think the Gaylord was too pricey for what we got, though should park where Erik did in the future I guess.

There's no where to really eat and as Hal found out delivery gets slammed.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

That‚Äôs when you start fighting

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

So you gotta be able to get into the katsu food places or bring stuff.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Gotta bring hat ravioli and coffee maker cup ramen

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

I mean I don't need to go to the room alot during the day except when I'm friggin 2b and my feet are ded

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Oh Jess. Don't you realize you're on a path to become Marisa? 9 cosplays in three days?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

If we could find something more cost effective with a kitchen and a lil more privacy it might be worth the trade off. But we have time

Lols I technically did 5 this weekend if you count formal and pj

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Woooo
Cosplaying 3 things on a Sunday a few Katsus ago was the hardest due to check out

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

You insane

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Pretty much.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

Gotta go fast but instead of fast it‚Äôs cosplay

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

Everytime Marisa changes cosplay Smash mouth plays

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

the problem is this year the lobby con got wayyyy worse

and that made everything get swamped

surprisingly tho

elevators weren't super bad

except for last day but even then it wasn't worse than expected

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

omg one otakon I had to wait half an hour for the elevator bluh
Zenkaikon gets elevator congestion too. Be careful with the stairs those things are a maze we ended up in the kitchen once somehow.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

really

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

I wonder how many more attendees Katsu had this year

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

i feel like zenkaikon has a shit elevator system, but i always thought the stairs only problem is the escalators get lines

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I'm going to bed. Future plans can be made in the future.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

The staff stairs are super tiny and crazy. Lanie and I got lost on the stairs and needed a cleaning lady to help lead us out.

How do you get lost on stairs? Idk but it‚Äôs happened multiple times

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

<@!245270932602486784>  hey i think peter and the gilly suit squad want ur vids of them

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

where they askin

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Labinnaks discord group call

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

o ya ill get it to them

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Specifically was asked when will you post them on insta and be like "lol look at my drunk (not actually drunk) friends "

Or something like that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

oh they asked YOU?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Ya I joined the call

And I think Peter(?) Asked about it

Not sure everyone in the call other than like Casey and Jake scribbles uses a screen name

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*



I'm not saying I'm a vindictive person.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*



Yup. right there. Behind the shield. Exactly where you needed to be.

I swear, Katsu is the most hit or miss con.

Photos are either really nice or completely uninteresting/bad.

no grey area.

Also I still do better outdoors, at least so far.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

What about really good pictures that seem perfect but are actually slightly out of focus when you view them full sized üëå

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

mhmm.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

dude who wanted voice actress to verbally abuse him at katsu got too nervous meeting his idol and could barely speak so didn't manage to ask his request. she has been spared.
but then he tagged her public account in his con write up saying "dm me if you're ever in philly/south jersey"
dude no

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

ha.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

thats the pic i was looking for last night! lol,although i look like im ignoring meg lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Lmao

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

well, that was the first pose where you were kissing Georgia.

The double kissy face is the second.

He only puts up his shield in that one though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

lmao the whole time i was like "RIP steelwolf"

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

not like anyone wanted a boy in dat pic anyway

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

wait true it was a gay ship.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Lol he hid good

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

where he can be easily cropped out

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

truths.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

_is tempted to just send this to the person who asked 'how was washington last weekend' from work._

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*



how are you supposed to post all your photos on one post........................

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

this was taken at katsucon i think this is what the gummy bears were for





**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

good safe for work sasuke

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

To be fair, I usually don't care about the level of NSFW we do being where ever it's relevant.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

[biru's boss walks by and sees the monitor] "lol nice"

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

probably?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

this is wholly relevant it's about the gummy bear scene

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Guy admitted to going to Jack Astors (a Canadian restaurant chain) because of the uniforms.

Like, he's married and a good guy, but he ain't above a bit o lewd.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

reported

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

that's we yelled "Japneet" all through the christmas party.

Japneet is the HR girl in Canada.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

my first thought was a mix of "japan" and "yeet"

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

None of us would make it through an HR review.

you are not wrong.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

o biru when you saw flora what was she cosplaying
flora and meg said they were gonna cosplay flora and jakob for katsu but I didn't see pictures of it so I don't think they finished in time

maybe I can still do corn with them üôè

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Ranka.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

ooo nice. gorgeous delicious deculture.

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Did talk to her too, which was nice.

she seemed as rushed as I was though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

OH are those yaks



**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I get that Steven. Despite having talked to you once.

I wouldn't call it worst, but there's stuff to gripe about.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

hey i know that person

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

yeahhhhhhh magfest next year instead

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

ye i feel bad for flora and steve this was their first katsu after years o magfest

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

ugh but even more chance of bad weather üò¶

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

*Just go to the gaylord for a friend vacation weekend*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

they're married right?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

ye.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

other married peeps! whoooo

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

there's Jenn and Woody too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

ye!

not sure if married, but they are married even if they arent

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-20*

zippy and freckles aren't married but they've been together like 10 years that kind of counts right

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I definitely feel like I've heard/seen they're married. But can't be sure.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

the genderbent renora we met at the formal got engaged as renora for real and not for faksies like ethan and casey so 10 pts to them

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

NOT FOR FAKSIES LMAO

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

You'd want to do Mag over Katsu tho?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Mag is like katsu but smoler

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

NAH TANKCON

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

***TAHNKCON***

I know Katsu was your favorite tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

ya but even i can see when its too crowded

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

=/

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

but January üò¢

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Lets be real Jess, Feburary has no better chance of good weather than January.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

tho apparently magfest has more attendees

they were 20k this year

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

less lobby conning probably.

People go to magfest and actually do events.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

tru. i feel like mid february is a little better than january. id just hate to not be able to go cuz snow,. or get stuck down there

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

a little snow can't stop weebs in cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

georgia can drive

XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Georgia hates driving too tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

ugh yeah the katsu lobby conning was so bad

its too, i let hal drive my car most of the time im visiting, and i dont like anyone driving my car

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

wouldn't that say more about Hal than you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

i mean yes hal is a good noodle and i trust him

but im so adverse to driving that my adversion outweighs my anxiety over someone else driving my car

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

yea im saying more cuz she has a truck

not for her driving necessarily

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I figured.

I mean, it was very nice of Tom to do the driving this trip and it was nice, but I do expect whatever the next trip to DC is I'll do the driving.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

only 198 days till colossalcon east!

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

yup.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

yo

Katsu was 20k too

considering it was already 18k 2 years ago

plus the lobbiests

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*



i got ittttt

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

wHoS tHaT

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

OWO

Is it too early to make the Zenkai rwby FB event?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Did you put in for a panel?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Ye

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Only thing that would be annoying is if you have to change the time of the shoot later because of the panel.

Then again, I want you running shoots rather than Deca or some other person, so have it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Yeah I didn't want ~~stupid people~~ that group taking it

And people at Katsu were worried I wasn't hosting it again

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I think you can. People are already doing lineups so.

oooh yeah, this way when the rest of the people plan lineups they'll already know there's shoots.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

My other worry is that I might not be able to go Friday depending on how finals get scheduled

But i guess if that's the case... you guys will be there?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

very true.

Need... a second for yo shoot runnin...?

üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Gladly, you handled Katsu the best that you could given a shit location

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

why not just schedule it for saturday? am i missing something?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Nah two days of it

Friday and Saturday

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

there'll be one both days. silly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

We had a lot of people to both shoots last year

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

oooooo ok

spicy

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Ya it was a hit

People loved ~~me~~ it ;V

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

it's where I got noticed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

üëÄ

so will you host both?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Yeee If i can

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I was going to offer to help anyway, cause I like doing this stuff.

!teamwork

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Also, if it comes down to it you can request to a professor to take a final at a different time. It's pretty common to do.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

Yup. I don't believe it myself.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

its a post con miracle

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Ha. Probably someone pissed about Katsu who dropped zenkai.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

RIP thanks bro

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

You interested in riding with us then Georgia?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

üöó

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

YEEET

wait

literally like in the car

or like in the cool slang sense of the word

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

i think he means in the literal car

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

üôå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

does da car have room for ~~all this instagram famous-ness~~ me

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

i am not sure which car we are taking üòÆ

ours probably not lols

cuz tiny

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-20*

maybeeeee ours

maybe not tho xD no clue

depends

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

well have one less suitcase next time than this time

i mean if we took billys car we could pu stuff in the back seat and 2 people could still sit back there

thats not really possible with ours cuz 4 seats

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

I'm gonna have to drive up alone :c

(For room) 
Also I call dibs on being honorary second

Also yeeet Bill

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I meant the room, but car is good. You won't miss all our gossiping.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

Messages came out of order, 
1. Poo I gotta drive up alone 
2. Yeet Bill nice getting the room 
3. I am honorary shoot second :3c

Wait I'm the first man of the shoot (like first lady of president )

Ugh I don't want to drive to zenkai alone, every year I end up having to nap on my way home outside a wawa in the car

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

how long is the drive?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

And to answer your vaguely phrased question, with my car should be able to make 4 fit Georgia.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

It's not particularly bad but it's the nature of the route

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Meanwhile Tom *likes* to drive in PA.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

cuz is easy

driving in populated areas is stressful and busy

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

I can mindlessly drive down 95 for 2 hours no problem, but my drive to zenkai goes through a lot of Amish country and back roads  among other things so I get to concerned to drive tired

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Highways are always preferable.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

blast metal

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

You could go north then west.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

It makes it so much longer and I have to go around Philly then

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

If Zenkai was one week later I could've gone home with hal

Darn

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

You can still go home with me ;)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

üòâ

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

So I guess that's both of you in for the rooming.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

I need to apply for off first but otherwise yes

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

HUZZAH

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

gag shot.

or rather, Georgia just happened to laugh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Ok that's what I thought

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-20*

i'm pretty sure I said a funny

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-20*

Looks like you made a dead parents joke

And jaune is oblivious to why the other 2 don't think is funny üòÇ

Wow that was quick

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Nice timing isn't it.

There's too much good luck going on today.

I'm going die on the way home aren't I.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

*stops casting cool luck spells on you*

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Ha. Or maybe spending a weekend with Georgia has suppressed my bad luck charm.

*if I was prettier I really am just Qrow*

You want to share the event to the zenkai groups now?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

I asked to join the group I'll share it

Oh wow they accepted my invite right away

Ya I'll share it

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I think I'm in another one too. Lemme check.

Added you to it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Dooooone

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

Don't forget the other one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

There's another?

The FB event?

**Bill** - *2018-02-20*

I added you. Different zenkai social group.

This one is larger I believe. It's labeled official.

Smaller actually.

I can just post it though?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-20*

Ye do it



My horoscope from yesterday

About Katsu??? üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Le done.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

oof

Hittin home tho?

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Applies to me as well I suppose.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Maybe dis the Winter?

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Wrong day.

Saw Jen post a video about Katsu being empty at 5am and someone bragging about how they had no trouble shooting.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

says she was winter friday and saturday

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Oh rip you right.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

and yea i saw that video lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Alternative Katsu: sleep during the day and do night to morning.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

or go to bed super early and wake up super early

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

The late night stuff is cool though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

like what? (not being sarcastic i actually dont know)

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Formal, pj parties, 18+ events, bar meetups, pj parties...

Rave.

You know, all the things we did.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

we didnt go to any bar meetups or 18+ events or raves üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

We could have.

I was too tired from the days to rave though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

ye me too lol i could have on Saturday after the formal tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

After formal I'd have had a better shot.

I had a good buzz going post formal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

ye me too, not drinking buzz, just like hyped buzz lols

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Mm.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

OR MAYBE ERIC YES IM STILL NOT SURE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Erriiiiikkkkkk ahhhhhhhhh y u dooooo

*killing me softly plays in the background*

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Give me some of that swag.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

I never realized katsucon is considered an elitist con

Especially in comparison to magfest

I always felt like magfest where it's gamers obsessing over games and not appreciating non game cosplay would be more elitist but apparently not

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

i feel like katsucon is what all the "professional" cosplayers use to try and one-up each other with fancier and fancier cosplays, it's got the most number of professional cosplayer guests and it's cool that the costume quality is high but that makes it hard for new or less experienced cosplayers ; - ; tiny cosplay kiddos

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

Yeah I would consider katsu elitest

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

we make our own con. it'll be the most elite of all because there won't be any elitism aside from it being the most elite.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

Lol see my lack of caring about photoshoots and ignorance of the cosplay community meant that the elitism went completely over my head until I heard people complain about it this past week

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

what were people complaining about? :0 people obsessing over pictures?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

Nah more about snooty cosplayers kicking smaller cosplayers out of shoot spots either by telling them or just encroaching on their shoot area as if it were there own

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

omg that's horrible

that happened to us at otakon lol, I was shooting a group and we picked a random spot and we just got started when a girl came over really angrily and told us we had to move asap for the mlp gathering in like 20 minutes.
no one ever showed up for her gathering.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

MLP is serious business

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

it is indeed
even better she was cosplaying sunset shimmer. costume to match her personality. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

Eyyyyy(who's that <:lenny:395307171539189760> )

Wiki tells me it is an antagonist

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

she's the antagonist of the first equestria girls movie, though i hear she's nicer in the sequels after getting beat up through the power of friendship

ye

think mean girls

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

That I know <:lenny:395307171539189760>

That was supposed to be a dab

How did it become lenny

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

lenny dab

i heard that the mlp movie was really good....................... i.......... might watch it

not equestria girls i've seen that it's meh <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

I missed entire trends cuz I spent too much time consuming ...other media...
*Looks at my 1000 hrs in the darksouls series and sweats nervously*

Prob closer to 1500 hrs oof
I don't even wanna know the hour totals of the elder scrolls games...
Or. League...

Time that could have been spent watching MLP üòè

Woops

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

if you have a switch it counts the hours for you :3c

come on man what've you been doing when you could've been watching ponies

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

Steam counts the hours too but I also plays a bunch of the series on x box too

So that time is a mysteryyyyy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

holy fudge pony movie has a cat character. they went all out furry.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

why is this so high quality

https://youtu.be/fktlkNNp8Mw?t=48

you can feel how smooth that animation is

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

Is that song title a robot unicorn attack reference

Also that is definitely a Disney song

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-21*

yo mlp has the best disney songs

have you ever seen the show

biru i'm converting the server into bronies

this is straight up that one scene from Tangled

https://youtu.be/0rgBWhNIDOE?t=14

one of those weird cases where the horrible fandom gave the show a bad name while simultaneously pouring tons of cash into it that they used to vastly improve the show

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Definitely elitist con.

<@!245270932602486784> if you're talking about Rebecca con, are you guys not doing room I got or...?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-21*

I think the idea is we visit her for a party?

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Ah, reading it again that makes sense.

I just woke up.

Why do my shoot photos look like friggin hall shots.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

cuz theres a billion people

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Not even that.

so much rip.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Yee Hal got it right

It sounds like a lot of people are rooming with Rebecca so I wanna make sure I pop by at some point to hang with everyone

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

not a bad idea, though they'll likely be at the con most of the time anyway.

If it were me I'd make the 'party' day thursday evening so there's no con events going on same time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Sakuras thinking about going to Zenkai



I feel like she's about to ask if I have room space

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

I feel like she is too lol.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

*tiny voice* id really like to keep our room to 4 people so we can all have ample room to get ready and move around and hang out

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Zenkai, unlike Katsu, we won't be hanging out in the room.

Zenkai is cozy, and has plenty of space to be on the con floor together as a group.

*Zenkai is officially my favorite con btw, now that've been to Katsu once*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

üò¶

but i just got *out* of room stuffing for zenkai

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Wait what's our actual room for zenkai

Or, roomS plural now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

me you hal tom bill andrew aaron and john

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Myself, Andrew, John, Aaron, Tom, Jess, Georgia, Hal.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Owo JNPR room?

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Most likely.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

I don't wanna take sakura but would we theoretically add another?

(I'm mostly thinking like Ryan or someone we like)

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

We weren't planning on it, at least.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Gotchu üòé

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Was Ryan at Zenkai last year?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

Nah

But he a Good Boi‚Ñ¢

Mood: the guy who posts three times in a row asking about final fantasy at RTX

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Go outside.

This weather.

Jeezus.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Sunday was bug again right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

mmmm i did wanna make my sole survivor suit for sunday

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

oh wait, fallout.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

OOOO

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

i mean erza is similar make up to pyrrha

which means doing it friday

but idk how to split the day

pyrrha morning, erza afternoon?

rwby shoot is at 3

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Zenkai formal is friday isn't it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

yeaaaah

so i could do erza on saturday after weiss

and put that dark red make up over weiss'

_but thats another not full day of v4 weiss_

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

So I'm going to suggest *subtly* not splitting Weiss.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

do weiss on friday full day

then split erza and pyrrha on saturday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

but also i wanted to do schneeblings with gen and lani on saturday

orz

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

https://sdl-stickershop.line.naver.jp/stickershop/v1/sticker/4519867/android/sticker.png;compress=true

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

maybe bump erza to connecticon

At least, armored erza can get bumped

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

true, connecticon will have less people we know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8d/db/0b/8ddb0bf7780be4a9b038a1ef4dd34e57.jpg

i could do that erza as part of friday cause thats easy to change

dont really care for that outfit THO LOL

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

So Pyrrha morning, Erza, then back to Pyrrha for formal?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

yah im just gonna bump erza to connecticon

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

I'd uh. Imagine that'd be difficult for you to wear.

yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

sorry erza youre gettin bumped again oops

at least im finally finishing my vault suit tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

could do her at anime next too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

nah anext ill have played awakening by then, so i have time set aside for cosplaying that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

or *gasp* not do pyrrha üò¢

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

nAH I HAVE MY JNPR

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

(Jess and Tom aren't going anywhere)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

i was thinking of doing nora on saturday (super tentative tho)

toms also prob gonna have something new in the mix

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

poop

gosh im getting some good mileage out of my pyrrha cosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

are you doing weiss for formal at zenkai?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

nah

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

c:

So Pyrrha/Weiss/Fallout. Simple.

Simple is good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

~~will people get sick of seeing me in pyrrha someday~~

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

well, I won't be for Zenkai. We can get actually decent JNPR photos without *the crowd of lobby conners at Katsu*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

tru

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

im glad that 2b, nora and hiyori all wear like no make up/similar makeup

just add blush for nora

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

And I just placed an order for a XQD memory card which should be much more reliable than even my good card and can do extremely fast write speeds.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Pro gear.

pricey, but pro gear.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

tru

im hype about sole survivor tho

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

though, Georgia has less rwby cosplays to her name than most.

Reiley has done half a dozen at least, for example.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

tru

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

CPAC is pretty much a one day con.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-21*

OH ye u right

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

**Bill** - *2018-02-21*

Maybe when I does a post for Cinder/Pyrrha shoot.

I never gave her a card, so.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

She liked like 3 of my posts but no follow

So I lied

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-21*

oh lmao

you got the ol razzle dazzle

to be fair we havent talked to her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-21*

Ye

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

Homestuck cosplay group when

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

no.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-22*

Biru you can do it too don‚Äôt worry

There are lots of trolls for everyone to cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

So I'd normally start watching the hotel and con for room block announcements about now. Ignore my opinions, what's the con(lol)census on Katsu?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-22*

id do it............... but like as a social con

may also wanna wait til april to see if theres policy changes

**Bill** - *2018-02-22*

having the room and canceling is better than not getting one imo, but otherwise waiting on policy changes is an interesting (if optimistic) idea. other's opinions?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-22*

I liked da katsu

but idk if tom would wanna do the drive again

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-23*

I love katsu

And I will go next year

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-23*



if I am in freedomland i will attend katsu

**Bill** - *2018-02-23*

Alright. So where did people stand on doing Georgia's suggestion of Magfest instead?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-23*

If I have to choose 1 it'll be katsu

**Andrew** - *2018-02-24*



It's a event in the style of the anime

Over the top dueling

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Yo finally.

I've been saying that needs to happen for years.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-24*

that sounds like it should be a panel rather than a random meetup :0

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw5c4uWp7JpJdpLizYgHfNAeiTN5xs2L5-QYSP704uQ

But _ITS BEGINS_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Shoots to be planned I guess.

I'm working on Katsu stuff all afternoon so good timing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

I don't wanna go as ham as Katsu so I'm making sure I don't lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

*snark about you barely making an 11am on the floor time and going to 9:30*

Same. We killed ourselves for Katsu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah I meannnn Zenkai it'll be relatively easy to be done by like 9:30

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

It's dat obsessive streak we have. üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Friday will be mostly social day cause I gots a lot of pics of Pyrrha already

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Final line up is Pyrrha/Weiss/Sole Survivor?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

So early to make line up lols

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Georgia has line ups through 2018.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

I don't know what order were doing for zenkai yet depends on Tom's new cosplay and when he wants to do it but I was thinking rwby on Saturday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

True though

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

But who are they dressed as?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

It's boudoir, doesn't matter as long as it's skimpy and you have a wig.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

It totally matters üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

All of them are cinder

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Here to ruin the good time

Does Sarah do a RWBY cosplay? And y can't I remember

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Cinder, neptune, and yang

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Sarah does the Weiss that Georgia REALLY doesn't like. üòõ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Sarah cosplays yang as primary rwby right

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I guess?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Oh shiiii ok

Yea now I remember lols

Ah yes JNPR Yang Neptune and ..... Cinder??? Lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

I guess sakura could be Blake and Ryan sun

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Lmao Blake makes more sense than cinder at least üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Has Ryan done Sun?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

*He probably has*

Hi Dan, how's it going.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

Cosplay boudoir is just so awkward sometimes

Like some people just don't look comfy

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

well, it is a rather intimate thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Yea it's not like a thing just anyone can do

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

*Or a way to get patreon followers*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

I mean anyone can do it I'm not saying it should be restricted more like you've gotta be brave

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

mhmm. What's the term used alot, body confidence?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Ye that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Yup yup

Like I'd probably do it with a friend/friends for the lolz

But never for the public

That's weird, ain't no one need to see me strutting my stuff in undies

Except hal <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

üôÑ

They're baaaack

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Yea I considered getting a shoot done for a wedding present but dems expense  granted I could have had a friend do it but ye

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

but yes, do with friends for yourself/SO. No patreons.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Double is what we have? Or no?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Single room, two rooms.

probably could use better terminology.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Whats the split on each?

Mean how many did you divide by

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

8.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

So per person payment is 78?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Lol I'm not stuffing 8 people in a room plz

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

It's 8 over two rooms right

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

At the payment of 116 yea

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah, the single column is in accurate as it's a higher number now.

single isn't an option, but my table is formatted so it stays there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

So pay $40 more dollars and get a bed basically

Anyway yea 8 ppl isn't happening so 116 per person

So 232 from me and Tom

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Updated it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Ooooh okay

I wasn't sure how to read it

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Table's more to show the math break down than anything else.

Bottom line is for the full weekend it's 116 a person.

which is thursday->sunday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Gotchu üëç

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

you two didn't know if you could do thursday right?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

I won't be able to do Thursday, must I still pay for it ?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I'd think not.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

I can't on account of a midterm orz I might even be doing a halfway Friday til my teacher gives a confirmed test time

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I'll have to do the costs by night, but I don't think I'd be fair to charge you for something you won't be there for.

Just don't say it's for a con, say it's like, a grandma's birthday in Kentucky or something.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Oh no I can't skip a final that's a big no no

It's near impossible to reschedule finals

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

Lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

especially cause my prof is a good dude but he's a hardass about attendance

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

I asked about rescheduling a final because I was sick once

My teacher was like "sure you'll just have to take it next semester"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

So bill would it be like 116/3 nights for cost per night, times 2 for two nights, 77.33?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Ha.

Remember when we did hoodie NPR and I told you I split hot chocolate on the white part of my sweatshirt?

Same sweatshirt, same thing.

kill me.

Huzzah my approximation math was close

Sweet

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

the numbers are pretty easy once you get the total/night.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Did you see about heathers cosplay event Bill?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

just looked at it ye.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

I wish she had a FB event

would feel more official that way lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

this ain't a super official thing.

From what I read.

Well it's an hour and half away from me.

Add times to my place as needed.

The event is effectively to stand there and look cool at a toy store.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeah I didn't want to think that that was the case but??

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

The contest has a decent prize? No guesses on how well it'll be judged.

If there was a guarantee of people attending for cosplay advice, I'd imagine that'd appeal to you Georgia. But there isn't.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Mmmmm good point

I mean I WAS tempted to go to a minicon that Saturday instead.....

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

and sakura sunday is that sunday.

what's the minicon?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Kinda!con, it's a lot of local fan artists

And a ton of locals are going apparently

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Oh right, that's in Morristown isn't it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Ye in the place with the shit lighting

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

That's local enough driving to phili the next day won't be annoying at all.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Wheeeeres Morristown

Also are we going to sakura Sunday?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I am.

I wanna go see my boi <@!141729881779077121> and such.

<@!350847001937707022>  might be at it too?

Could make that a whole weekend, do Kinda!con, stay somewhere together, then go together to sakura sunday and back...

https://www.facebook.com/events/1861644207480067/

whoops wrong chat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Morristown means hotel or someone's house?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Morristown is a half hour from me, probably Tom and Jess...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Yeahhh the more I look at kindacon, the more I wanna go there instead

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

tsk tsk.

You missed the opportunity to say you'd *kinda* prefer to go there.

I'm with you on that though.

Interesting. I got a PM about the event too.

From Heather.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Oooo interesting

She remembers you then, that's good

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I you know, shot for her Saturday.

So.

*sunday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

~~look at Sakura though~~

Jk not a funny joke

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Nah, Sakura's good. I totally get doing the copy pasta thing.

Do you want to do sakura sunday then Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Mmm lemme check it out

I definitely wanna do Kindacon, dunno if I'll bring Weiss or my Vault Suit

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Vault suit if you finish it in time. Weiss will look miserable in the bad lighting.

Though there's the green, which is prettier.

but outside.

Well, at the least we're doing Kinda. I'm going to sakura sunday, cause it was a good time last time I went.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

How prevalent is cosplay at Sakura Sunday?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

There was a runway for it's costume contest.

It's pretty big.

and that was two years ago.

I have photos from the con, just not up anywhere. Can show you, but cosplay is definitely 40% minimum the people there?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

How hard do people go? I feel like I need a dainty cosplay for something with _cherry blossoms_

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

I don't remember seeing armor...

*oh my god, back when I used the blue label for publishing*

So guile suit dude.





Russian Yato with a sign. <- TOM TAKE NOTES.



This dude is pretty goin hard.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Mmmmm I do still have Yurippe... and Weiss is pretty dainty....

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Weiss might be pretty with pink cherry blossoms. *Do I expect the trees to bloom at the right time, no*

But maybe your luck will make it happen.



Some hardcore stuff.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Mmmmm thinking about that vault suit for kindacon

I should get it done

Yeah I'll wear Weiss or Yurippe for Sakura Sunday, I'm game

Carpool?

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

mhmm.

Alright, das us at least. Tom will decide two weeks before the event he actually want to do it... üòõ

Like, one of those long ones by the washington monument.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

_watah flowahs_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-24*

and they had a dragonfly andni was like i wonder if they have a lotus

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Flower power goes to the cherry blossom festival

Perf

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

Ohhhh Ren would be good for the cherry blossom festival

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

And with Georgia's high luck stat they might actually bloom that day.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-24*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Muahaha

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Though Geek Week is the next thing, week from now right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Next Friday yupppp

Dunno what to wear yet

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

*Ethan: "Bikini Pyrrha!"*

I'm actually starting to wonder the percentage of italic snark messages versus normal messages I send is.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

*shows up in completely covered Pyrrha*

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*



Everyone tells you to cosplay Ann.

Cosplay "Ann trying to get out of being painted nude as a distraction"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Lmao yeah

I can't fault people for telling me to cosplay Ann tbh

That's my hair after a day in a wig cap

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

Ann's fun too.

on my playthrough I dated Ann.

I don't see the appeal to Makoto, and Futaba feels too much like a little sister to date.

some people really like Haru too, but she's added to the game super late so I didn't bother.

I was trying to binge the 90+ hours before AnimeNext.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-24*

Dayum

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-24*

If I show up to geek week who do I cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-02-24*

This is the best line of that entire game.

Tis often how I feel about ya'll.

It's a baby gazebo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-25*

what is going on with CPAC
why are they doing panel applications in waves. why are there at least 3 different 'waves' of panel applications
why are event sign ups only 30 minutes before the event. is it because so many people were no-shows in previous years.

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBY/comments/8073u2/stand_together_saphraen_two_figs/?st=JE3L9U44&sh=b0abe30f das da Illa from Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

ohh i saw those on the katsucon group

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

I wanna know this guys gear and the time of day for that shoot.

And how much editing he does.

*hello inferiority complex*

Cause those are sharp photos and pretty as hell.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

looks like dusky? or dawny?

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

It does. Overcast.

There's definitely editing going on, though I don't know to what extend as the background, while beautifully blurred, is real Katsu grounds.

*extent

Dunno about lighting equipment.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

the background is all real katsu grounds and not another place edited in, i can pinpoint where all those locations are

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

due to the lack of people imma say pretty early in the morning?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

ye i was gonna say later in the evening but u right those stairs are always crowded

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Only time Katsu had clear space was 4-9am.

Period.

Depending on how much light equipment was in use, actually, no matter what, this guy is so much better than I. Beautiful work.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

fight him and steal his ability

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Not how it works.

Definitely had light equipment.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

Just remember is not a competition fren. specially cuz its a hobby

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Nah, inferiority complex galore.

I gotta be the best.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

you'd say thing to me in relation to art or cosplay XD

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

I'd say you don't give yourself enough credit for the quality of your work.

Different thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

if i remember correctly i got got some okay lighting equipment for pretty cheap from B&H

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

didn't katsu ban light equipment though? unless it was handheld
maybe they could get away with using it outside?

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

But I appreciate the thought.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-26*

use one as a pillow and absorb knowledge via osmosis

it's how i passed chemistry

**Bill** - *2018-02-26*

Lucky you.

I'll have to try that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-26*

you're welcome

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

_JESS_

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

No offense you two, but I'd be happy to see Renora photo bump the roller skating one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

üòö

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Won't find out till friday though.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

i would too tbh

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

The every other post cosplay/photography pattern can be annoying sometimes but really keeps my feed looking organized.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

does that mean  renora is scheduled for friday?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

i think the roller skating one isn't that great üòÖ  Renora looks much better üëç

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

agreed lol

how did you see your top posts?

o wait its the website

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

It's not that it's a great photo Hal, it's that you can see the passion between you two.

gabstats.com

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

we're just smoochin

super innocent

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I said passionate not lewd.

People can kiss and it can do nothing. Or people can kiss and it inspires emotion.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

mmm touche

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

I say that, I don't think I have anyone kissing without some real good emotion.

Obviously not Tom and Jess, nor you two... Ryan and Dan gayed it up real good...

nicu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-02-27*

i think tom and i could step it up honestly lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

i wish i could see my follow count charted over time

i wonder if it really is growing exponentially

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

mm, probably can't.

I doubt it's a recorded metric.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

you should be able to somehow

it should be a recorded metric tbh'

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-27*

yeah rumor has it that when you gain followers, you gain them exponentially

i guess i believe it because i went from 2k in November to 2.8k in February

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law

Computer science theory that says technology, or in the case followers, grows exponentially every two years.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-27*

lol

**Bill** - *2018-02-27*

Look at what Gabstats can report to you. It can report, per post, `likes`, `comments`, and `timestamps`. These are all static pieces of a post.

It can aggregate that information to give you likes you got in the last 4 months, but that's based on one of those core stats.

A user has the same static values. One of which, is follower count.

It's one number being updated over and over.

Yeah I have Jake. Let me tell you whats what.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-28*

100lbs of gummy bears

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Rtx plan Georgia. What issssssssss

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

Nahhhh

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Man I got gossip but maybe I won't share.

What about rooming? Where'd you end up?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

we're in the big house with chris and evie and peter and all them

the one with the pool that she got picks at last year

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

I meant for school.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

oooooooooh

i saw rtx plan and thought it was still same topic

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

Oh in another McCormick room

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Random?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

trade with their friend?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

Nah random

Though interestingly enough the boys offered me a space in their room and I was like naaaah I'm gooood

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

That isn't news is it?

Well if we think about it, it's probably your good luck getting you to transfer.

Watch the bitches room is actually going to be a pot den or burn down, and the room you end up in is great.

I'm satisfied. So Ethan messaged me his new bottle of bourbon and I was like cool and he was like I should join him for a drink sometime.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

Interesting

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

yall 
we should just like

make a gossip channel

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

He's really feeling lonely, he said he wanted to hang with me and y'all

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Hmm...

Well, seeing him Friday.

Right?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

He's feeling lonely? after ditching all the people who wanted/considered him a friend

such surprise

much shock

very unexpect

wow

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-28*

Yeah Ethan messaged me too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

I wonder if I'll get a message from him someday 
Probably not since I'm not a Jersey resident

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

And I thought I was special.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

Or because he thinks I peacock around to much

/shrug

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Hmm...

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-02-28*

Yeah probably üòì

To both

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Ethan can tomorrow's problem.

Shower thought: Geek week is being held during midterm week. Decision process???

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-28*

Abandon studies to become full nerd.

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

I guess.

Didn‚Äôt Rowan ban club stuff during finals/midterms?

Or am I confusing reality with persona.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-28*

Midterms were all different times so you may be living in za anime worldo.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

In my experience STEM majors have multiple "midterms" in a semester unlike non stem majors where they only have one literal midterm exam

Cause February is not the middle of the term at all

It should be like mid March

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

You‚Äôd be correct. Semesters usually had a test covering a third of the class.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-28*

We had a final once but when everybody got there the professor wasn‚Äôt there and the chalkboard said ‚Äúno final, have a nice break.‚Äù
Everyone sat around anyway until the start time just in case. Then some lady came in and was like ‚Äúwhere??? Is your professor???‚Äù And took our attendance down on a piece of paper. She said ‚Äúif anyone comes in late, tell them to come to the gallery downstairs and sign in on this paper.‚Äù Someone came late, we took them to the gallery to sign in. They had no idea what we were talking about or who the lady was. 
Good times.

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Rip my memories of college apparently.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-02-28*

Biru: remembers college
Hundreds of high school anime girls flash through his field of vision

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Probably accurate.

So geek week thing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

ye whats up

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

I'mma a come to dat.

Especially since Hal will be up.

Should I just find my way to the geek fest and meet you two there?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

yeeeee

theres parking at college ave

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

that'll do then, sometime around 8.

There's like, 30 people on this event.

Why is... Ethan doing this to begin with?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

idk man

back when i cared about the business i offered it

and he jumped right on it

though a ton of clubs come and theyre not on the facebook event so theres that

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

> Me, blending in on a college campus



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

-wonders how geekweek which is a college student event with little to no cosplayers will serve as any benefit for Ethans business, which sells expensive cosplay props-

((even if they are relatively inexpensive in comparison to other prop makers))

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

it won't.

prop weapon clients aren't even a majority of cosplayers.

Most are too casual to spend that kind of money.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-28*

yeahh

most prop weapon clients are collectors

people willing to spend big money on it

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Feel like collectors wouldn't be interested in replicas made for carrying around a con.

They'd be more into heavy wood, or metal.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

his loss

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

<:dva_salt:365521119534645254> Salty <:dva_salt:365521119534645254> 

I approve.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

honestly i offered it because originally i wanted to go to geek week but was stuck going to VA

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

Oh yeah, that VA trip was this weekend too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

yeah but then i was like lol no

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

to which there must be celebration.

Hey, that's true. Friday is it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

is the celebration of not being with ethans company anymore?

**Bill** - *2018-02-28*

what else would it be?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-02-28*

celebration of being half done with midterms lmao

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

did you want a celebration of that? üòã

the thing ends at like, 11:30 right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

11 ye

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

So I was going to say if we wanted to have a plan for afterwards (maybe not dinner, ice cream, i dunno) we could plan ahead of time, potentially so Ethan wouldn't invite himself along.

BUT

We'll see how these second bomb cyclone plays out cause I'm not heading to rutgers in a blizzard.

I love you guys but not that much.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

shhh it won't happen

i need to be allowed to visit

which means I need it to not be a problem, otherwise how will just recovered from illness Hal be allowed up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

oh yeah no hal we have rocky to go to afterwards anyways

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

noooo, cause if you don't go up this weekend you'll come sooner and we'll see you then.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

that makes no sense bill

I visit this weekend cause I don't have work

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

oh right, you have that work thing now.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

i get my work schedule every week and  have a 5/7 chance of having to work the weekend

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

that's oddly specific odds.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

i work 5 days a week

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

and good ones, tbh. I'd always work at least one day on the weekend at Quickchek.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

i might have mathed wrong

lets think

i think i definitely mathed wrong

one second while I do STAT math properly

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

anyway, storm starts tonight.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

üò¶

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

If the roads are crap I'm going to refrain from geek week. And no matter how stupid Ethan is about getting there, you üëè don't üëè have üëè to üëè go üëè if üëè the üëè roads üëè suck üëè <@!245270932602486784> .

Too many claps.

and if you're already on the campus, it's a moot point.

But!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

yeah ill be on campus already lol

but yes understandable~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

so if I did this right

the chances I have of having both weekends off out of all my potential work schedules

is 1/19

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

that would imply that your work days are selected 100% randomly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

they aren't 100% random 
however they are not consistent, and I don't know the basis for the selection

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

most likely who has requested off.

As well as people who say "i can't work x time frame ever, cause night classes".

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

that effects my work hours more than days

the only people who work consistent days are the people who can only work the weekend

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

waaaaaay to many variables here, cant we just go with "Hal is not likely to have off on the weekends unless requested? "

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

^

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-01*

^

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

That's what I'm sayin

fuck I hate probability and statistics.



Salty! Great first impression, I want to hire you!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

oh WOW that person wanted to shoot with me

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

lol at Zenkai?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

how many people contact you for shoots?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ALL

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

just him i think

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

It hasn't happened before otherwise?

like, earlier katsu's or somethin?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

nah

claire ive known a couple years

i asked jpaden cause of sakura

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Oh wow, then dis loose canon is exactly that.

a loose cannon.

~~Or my plan to lay claim to INstAgRAM FamOUs WeZReZ CoSPLaY has succeeded and all the other photographers know to stay away, mahahahaha~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

le gasp

that would be cray

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

Considering you contacted me first?

Yeah, a little bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

as a rule of thumb i think typically cosplayers message first

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

*also considering how many times I've established I like you as Georgia more than wezrez cosplay, but.*

I'd imagine so.

So thought: when you contacted me the first time, did you think I had done work before?

I realize with the business cards that might have been possible.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

yeah i think i did

and if you didnt i assumed you knew what to do otherwise lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

ha lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

what do you mean by "had done work" like photoshoots?

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

yeah. Private shoots.

She knew I had a camera and I shot at the group shoot at Zenkai.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-01*

ah

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

ye so i figured if you knew about photoshoots that you had been at the con game a while

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

So, I wouldn't have (and likely never will) do the whole 'slots available post', so anyone I started shooting with would have had to be a friend and they'd have to ask me cause self confidence lol. Zenkai was the first time I shot someone individual, which was Andrew in Gumshoe. I had fun with it so I offered it to Marisa and Allison too at Animenext, and you messaged me...

So really, despite not knowing me you came in on the ground floor of my 'private shoot' career.

coincidentally, the only person who wasn't a close friend at the time. And now you... are a close friend.

Funny how that works.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

i nyoomed in

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

thaaaat you did.

and then I was like "see those two? right there? I'm going to ~~abduct~~ induct them into my circle." and history was made.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

whoopeeeeeee

**Bill** - *2018-03-01*

tangentially, I've left your zenkai schedule open as reminder to decide on times early rather than later.

Will get to that.

I think I want to run and pick up some shelving for one of my cabinets though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-01*

organizationnnn

**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

That's one way to spell dibs.

I guess I'm as much of a loose canon as loose canon though.

*Its just because I've put so many hours into Weiss ideas*

I swear.

<@!245270932602486784> If you want to claim the RWBY shoot at next, do it now.

I'm seeing shoots being shared.

well I doubt I'm making it to geek fest.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-02*

Ye, I don think so

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-02*

I is still gonna try

also question, assuming I make it 
chilling tomorrow ? :3c

**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

I've got D&D all day.

:c

Coming from south should be easier, but be very careful. The winds are as crazy as the snow.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-02*

I drove through the last storm bomb

I mean I'll still be careful of course lol 
but I got experience üí™

**Bill** - *2018-03-02*

I've been on 295 in a blizzard.

Experience doesn't mean repetition is a good idea.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-02*

lol yeah I know üòÖ

it tends to be a somewhat comforting thought for others

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-02*

Yea we can chill üëå

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-02*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-02*

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

How's it going with dark hacks guy you two?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

He left early

Made 50 bucks

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

No drama to report?

Can I take no response as a no, cause I really want to hear it was a clean break.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Uhhhhhhhh

Well there wasn't

Until I went to change out of Weiss

And I saw them hugging so idk what that means

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-03*

Well. I don't really care if him and Casey get dramatic. I only care about you in this case.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-03*

<@351785752197201920> BTW what time for the movie? For whenever you wake up

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-03*

_separated from the coolest of cool kids against his will_

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

mm.

I can't believe I'm going to manage to complete miss Hal coming up. Stupid snowstorm.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-03*

I miss you Bill üíï

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

üíó

You need to try and get up for St Patrick's day weekend, cause that's a thing we're doing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

OwO

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

So why are you only having lunch on Friday and dinner on Saturday?

At zenkai.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

OH no I'm eating like a normal person

But that's time to go OUT and sit and eat

As opposed to a quick thing

**Bill** - *2018-03-03*

Smart, though Saturday that's right during golden hour.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-03*

Eh I won't be doing shoots all day

And I'll bump around the schedule if I gotta

Also side note, Ethan's booth was apparently a bust

He made 50 bucks at geek week, and less that at the con

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Big surprise.

How much was he even selling on site? Wasn't his plan to take orders?

_watch he blames it on the lack of models. _

Anyway, not much to bump around. Unless you've booked a bunch already.

Biru stop breaking the law

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

You right tom is a minor.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Pls no that would make me creepy

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Can we confirm a bit of plan for that though? I'm good with Kroghs again and coming back to le vault.

<@!245270932602486784> mentioned wanting to know what plans we have, and Kroghs is more restaurant than bar so age isn't an issue. If <@!288513265661902858> can come up too that'd be great.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

It's all good with me

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

I work the 17th til 6 but then I have off Sunday üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

You'd have to come in the evening after work.

I ain't drinking heavily on a Sunday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Ye that's what I mean

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

<@!141729881779077121> you should come up too. If you haven't made plans with the boys yet.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

Or any other day of the week <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

*the boys*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

We wouldn't go it till around that time anyway

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

It's the same as last time then, nbd.

(I should pregame though, I've got to get more than a buzz this year)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Also St Moritz is across the street too they usually have music and stuff, and a large bar

Also restaurant

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Yeah, works for me.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Annnnddd my cousin works there whooo

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Just need somewhere that won't card the younglings.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Pfft.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

How about an amusement park

6 flags

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

You're too short for the rides Mari chan.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Plz don't let me drink like 10 drinks and a full glass of rum this year üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

That is ok I don‚Äôt ride roller coasters just the one that plays rock music and spins really fast

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

Teacups?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

I love that one!

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

You're welcome to come too Marisa, even if you're in Japan.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Himalaya

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

Naw teacups are ok but yeah that sounds like it maybe. I only know the one in wildwood.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

Some kind of Irish festival is happening in Yoyogi Park that day

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-04*

~~there's Irish people in Japan?~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Alright, that's the plan. Drinks in Sparta. 

I don't remember the last time I went to an amusement park.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

nO I don‚Äôt deserve the clover I was trying to put it on Georgias

**Bill** - *2018-03-04*

Take me to an amusement park ~~I never had friends to go with~~.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-04*

I‚Äôm in japan and part Irish <:lenny:395307171539189760> 
Also they celebrate everythin multicultural in Tokyo yoyogi Park is always happenin‚Äô

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

üéâ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-04*

I probably won't be able to come to St Patricks Day stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-04*

trying to fit a lot of people into Kroughs on ST patties day again sounds like trouble

with how packed it gets

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-04*

Well its me you Billy Andrew and Georgia?

**Bill** - *2018-03-05*

Right now, but dunno if Andrew can.

This time we can try to make reservation tho.

@everyone I guess, last few days for the current Zenkai price.

You going to grab the Next RWBY shoot Georgia? I could see treating it as a break from it too though...

What are the odds if I asked in my story for people to tell me their favorite set I‚Äôve shot I‚Äôd get any answers?

Realistically.

Not in a I want engagement kind of way, but in a ‚Äúmost people probably don‚Äôt look at albums they aren‚Äôt in‚Äù way.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-06*

DO IT

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

i mean...?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-06*

when is Zenkaicon again

**Bill** - *2018-03-06*

may 4-6.

we have a room on the 3rd.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-06*

hopefully nobody has taken those days yet

I'll probably arive May 4th in the evening

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-07*

has anyone answered ethan >w>?

**Bill** - *2018-03-07*

I told him I have to check on my plans.

which is true and I'll do that later.

You don't have to go if you don't want to Tom.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-07*

i responded and said ye day was clear and to keep me updated

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

So... the applebee's rebecca's party is supposed to be at is like, 15 minutes from the landcaster convention center.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

Soooooo

Scoping locations???

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

I mean, we're already going to be there. Also pretty sure the archery shop (best in the country!) I got my bow from is 5 minutes from the applebee's too. I'm mandating that as a side trip, iirc my arrows are rather beat up.

I mostly say this for Tom and Jess, since we're likely car pooling (though I'm not technically sure you confirmed your going?) and they'll have to be dragged along. You and your boi are welcome too of course.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-08*

WOOT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

<@!351785752197201920>  we're going to Rebecca's party right?

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

I also figure doing some other stuff while we're there makes the trip a little more worth it. Can't imagine the party is more than 2 hours.

right <@!351785752197201920> ?

*ugh answer you dork I want to change the topic*

oh fine.

Remember how Flora asked me to do some cosplay/out of cosplay photos for her and her husband?

Sort out the details about that and she's like 'whats the compensation' and I'm like 'eeeeh'.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

like cutsey couple photos?

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

engagement style.

and also aqua teen hunger force.

because nothing says couple like dressing as a soda cup and box of fries.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

lmao nice

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

I just dunno how to answer the compensation question.

cause, I am making a trip to princeton (which I'm turning into a weekend at Rowan, so it's on the way now that I'm doing that) and dedicating a saturday to this, that is a commitment. I'm not *stupid*, it's just... I don't really care about getting money? I have a day job for money, I like doing photos.

*Oh my god, I've become one of those people who doesn't use the verb `take` with photos, ew*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

so just ask them to buy you lunch or some shit

or pay for your gas

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

The lunch things is a classic, but not a good choice here. I'm going out with Andrew Jen and Jeremy right after.

You know those 'pay what you want' style sites? I was thinking of saying something like that. Cause I don't really know how (nor do I want to know) put a value on my time.

Or is that actually trolly?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

hmmm idk how that would work? I dont particularity care about getting paid for my side work, but alot of people usually start out with "Hey Jess can you do X for me? I'll pay you!" so then im like "sweet, sure"

Maybe just be like "toss me a 20 if you want, but no obligation?"

or do the gas thing

what time is the rebecca party?

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

I thought I saw 2?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

that sounds right

yea, its 2

<@!351785752197201920>  if we're going to rebeccas we have to make a mall trip for a pressie

we have a hot topic coupon!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-08*

Soooooo got some bad news

I can't request off for zenkaicon, which means I can only go if I get lucky and not  scheduled on Sat/Sunday

It's a "blocked off" time, meaning nobody gets to request off

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

:c

What's special about that weekend?

Mother's Day is the weekend after, but that shouldn't affect the prior...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-08*

Some sort of event at the store

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-08*

oh nooooo üò¶ UGH

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-08*

I think we're hosting something

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

**:c**

~~Think you can take the job at the other cafe still?~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-08*

No lol
Also they definitely wouldn't give me off

And have the same problematic week to week scheduling

**Bill** - *2018-03-08*

That's the shit part of retail...

well, one of them.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-08*

:((

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

Well, there's always a chance you can get coverage.

<@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> Saturday. What are you doing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-09*

Yea I think so

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

Latest we could leave is 11:30. Landcaster archery is right there, so it‚Äôs not additional. Unless <@!245270932602486784> or <@!288513265661902858> want to go there, we could leave earlier, 10:30 say and do that before lunch.

üôÑ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-09*

horseback cosplay
sometime in the future that should be a thing we do

lots o stables in nj
or I have an aunt in california with horses

[flies into california on the way back to nj just to get a picture of me cosplaying on a horse]

unless that's what you're talking about right now

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

Helpful.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-09*

dis could be us

mass group attack on titan horseback cosplay

*dis could be us*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-09*

That is pretty sweet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-09*

i know there's one place that does guided tours on horseback for $50> an hour we could try and get a group discount and be like "we don't really need the tour we just need somewhere that looks swag"

wait. less than. less than 50

ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-09*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-09*

understandable dear friend

insert I owe you my life meme

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-09*

The current range of emojis is existence is so limited

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-09*

i know, must add more

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-09*

Like, we have emojis that smile and have tears but we need more variations of those

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

You know what. I'll leave at 10:30.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-09*

How long does it take to get there?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-09*

2.5 hrs

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-09*

So we're getting there early to go to archery place?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-09*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-09*

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

<@!141729881779077121> Do you know if you'll make it up st patricks? If you do sunday I'd go see Tomb Raider with you, otherwise might plan something different.

**Andrew** - *2018-03-09*

I won't be free st patricks

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

:c

At least I'll be seeing you in april.

<@!228287793099440128> want to do another escape room? There's a couple for it to be 20 bucks on the weekend.

Georgia is in so we were thinking Sunday after st paddys.

**Dave** - *2018-03-09*

**Bill** - *2018-03-09*

Cool beans. You going to come to st Patrick's day?

Given you actually drink you'll be an excellent addition.

**Dave** - *2018-03-09*

**Bill** - *2018-03-10*

Kroghs in Sparta. Then back to Tom and Jess's.

<@!228287793099440128> <@!245270932602486784> Any preference on room? I've done speakeasy and jewel heist so those are out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-10*

Nah either or is good to meee

Or I guess any or is the quantifier?

**Bill** - *2018-03-10*

different difficulties.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-10*

The harder one then lmao

**Bill** - *2018-03-10*

Submarine is the absolute hardest.

*ngl that's my preference*

http://lastminuteescape.com/escape-rooms/?utm_source=Main+List&utm_campaign=accdddea02-SnowDay2018&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5a31a8ebff-accdddea02-145502745&mc_cid=accdddea02&mc_eid=93dc7b3e6e I forgot to link them.

That would help.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-10*

I like the hotel one

But I also like international relations and that's all USSR stuff

The sub is also cool tho

**Bill** - *2018-03-10*

I'm cool with the hotel too.

<@!228287793099440128>

<@!228287793099440128> Low on time so Hotel it is.

<@!245270932602486784> <@!228287793099440128> 3:10 or 4:40? My rough idea of a plan is go do room, have some dinner, then go home. I imagine it's going to be a slow morning getting up after saturday. ü•É

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-10*

4:40 I think

**Bill** - *2018-03-10*

alright, last mention of the night <@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> <@!228287793099440128> <@!245270932602486784> and I, Sunday the 18th, 4:40 in Wayne, the hotel room.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Ooo is it vanderwood or whatever his name is? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

*how do you know that*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Cuz character list on wiki, and searching the MM tag on tumblr üòÇ all the spoils.

I don't know anything about him tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

people want a vanderwood route but I don't think it'll happen hehehe
that'd be like getting an echo girl route

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Ewwww pls no

Dat binch

Yea I saw him and I was like "owo he got long hair, who dat??"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

long hair bois club vip

there is one chat at some point where he's in the messenger and everybody flipped out. it was a great chat.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Lmao why did that link to google maps for me? Yea I've seen some spoilers but none of them actually make sense to me yet

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

LONG HAIR BOIS CLUB VIP GOOGLE MAPS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

I have top teir membership

I'm honestly so confused with the story right now in MM so I basically have to play more. Cuz just playing zens route it was like "this guys tried to kidnap you and blow up your house but you bit his hand and ran away with your bf So he gave up"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

yee! each route tells a different story where different things happen but they all reveal clues about the bigger picture going on. some things overlap. they tie it together pretty nicely, especially in Another Story where everything takes place in the past. you get some really great origin stories for stuffs

was zen's route confusing?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Nah, I think it's the one they recommend to do first?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

ye good boy zen

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

They recommend to do all the casual characters first but I don't have much interest bin yoosung or jaehee but I'm scared I'll get confused if I jump to deep right away ü§∑

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*



you could always go back and do casual stories later if you want

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Yea! Such a good boi at first I was like well dis boy full of himself but then he developed an actual personality so that was cool üëå

Yea I was thinking I could just go back if I wanted too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Zen is also a spicy boi üòÇ are they all spicy? Or like is that his thing?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

he did perform in a spicy play üå∂ 
each character is a little different, there's usually at least one spicy-ish call per route. except jaehee. poor jaehee. 
in the valentine's DLC i think? everyone has 1 ending but 707 has 2 endings, a white chocolate ending and a dark chocolate ending that's essentially fluff vs spice

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Spicy jalapeno üå∂Ô∏è and omg that's amazing. He'd be all spicy and I'm like "everyone can see this chat yo"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*



there's a relatable picture i'm trying to find that i kept seeing but of course now that it's relevant i can't find it uguu



basically in his route zen is spice but in every other route he's like "MEN ARE DANGEROUS STAY AWAY FROM EVERY MAN ON EARTH"

i hear that seven zero seven is ripped. that seven has a six pack.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Ohhh yea I read that lmao

I hear he has a seven pack

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

bye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

üò≠

*How is he ripped when all he does his eat chips and sit at his computer*

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

üëÄ

*has a personal interest in that answer*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

The answer is.... He's an anime character

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

ripped

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

He is truly blessed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

i forget what route it's in but the characters actually try to discuss it in a chatroom. someone is literally like "707's actually ripped" and everyone else is like "how???"

it's because he's so religious he is blessed

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

*looks at catholic medals on neck that has been wearing as long as I've had them*

I don't think that's it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Yea! Lmao it gotta be that cuz soda, chips, and not leaving your house does not get you ripped

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

but have you dressed up as a nun

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Well that and.... Anime character

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

he does other things too sometimes <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Really talk though, pretty sure none of these Bois should be fit sept zen cuz he actually works out and I guess jumin cuz he runs like half an hour a day or something in his private gym

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

seven has a reason too ;3c
yoosung isn't fit he's a wimp which suits a college student
jaehee should be shredded with all the work she does

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Real talk:

You don't want to play a dating game with a bunch of fat dudes do you?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

idk about V. Ray is kind of ripped and he shouldn't be tbh there was a shower scene in his route

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Theres things between fat and fit Billiam

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

dream daddy was successful and had fat dudes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Jaehees fit from running around for jumin all day erryday

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Matter of perspective.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

actually maybe ray isn't too ripped it's hard to tell

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

rip
how much do you know or care about spoilers i don't want to reveal too much
also I think the end of V's route is pretty messed up that should have a warning imo

OH yeah some things ray does are a little. not child friendly. i could post a picture.
but now that I think about it V's bad ending is worse so??? ???? maybe V has a warning too and I just cant remember

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

üòÆ I mean I'm not actively looking for spoilers

I have like a minor impression of all the routes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

good that is good thing 2 do

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

I know more about V than Ray honestly

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

something messed up happens to V in one of the routes. can't remember which I'm assuming it's seven's

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

biru whose route are you aiming for

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

The MC.

Minus the whole lack of a face she pretty cute in what art I've seen.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

She has a face!



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

no eyes tho :3c (or does she?)
what about jaehee. or there's another route that ends up with a girl

OH YEAH

the avatar duh

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Golden eyes? Unique.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

YEET

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Yup. So imma romance the MC. Or. Herself. Myself?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

narcissist route

there are a few endings like that

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

*puts phone down for 13 days and romances self* üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

Hack the game so you play as a different character

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

3 hackers in the game

4

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

So many hackerz

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I know of software that I could write a visual novel in.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

biru writes his own mystic mess spin off dating game

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I just lack art, script, music, creative talent.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

renpy?

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

But I can code the game.

Yup.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

joint effort lets make a game

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Aurii visual novel. Every route Elfreide and Afina don't hook up in is a bad end.

Like fate stay night level bad ends.

3 good endings, 40 bad endings.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

YES

DO IT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-12*

That sounds horrible

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

LETS DO IT

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-12*

What are the 3 good ends

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Probably one where they end up in Callora, one in Eraia, and then one where they elope.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

Does this mean any route where the protagonist pursues Elfriede or Afina results in a Bad End as well

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

Aurii has no protagonist, so...

Alternatively:

I already established I'mma be romancing the MC.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-12*

*Am I the only one that doesn't like Rebecca's blake photos?*

She looks great, don't get me wrong.  The purple tinting just doesn't look good at all.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-12*

yeah im not a huge fan of the purple tint

too dark

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

I dunno why it's even there? It looks like a bad white balance setting.

And to let *that* slide the photographer did next to nothing for Rebecca and that's not cool.

There's literally an auto button, and like 8/10 you don't need to edit it anyway.

Colossal has such a weird breakdown for price.

Well, Oddly enough Colossal kinda pushes you out of overcrowding.

**Dave** - *2018-03-12*

last time i talked to him about colossalcon

**Bill** - *2018-03-12*

the per night price doesn't fluctuate all that much.

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Wouldn't it make more sense to spend a longer time here though?

Since it'll be your primary trip back while in grad school?

Georgia's awkward guy from Katsu is the last commenter.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

awkward guy?

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Sakura's photographer.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

oo he was awkward?

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I'm just repeating what Georgia said.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

well i figured, i just dont remember

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

yeah he was nice and friendly but so so awkward

im more concerned with HOW YOU SHOOT DURING A PANEL

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

it's more like a workshop.

Dunno about boudoir though.

Maybe the model isn't planning to strip?

Or maybe said panelist has this idea, but no model signed up for it yet?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

*holds workshop in hotel room*

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I imagine they'd use a few tables to a 'bed'.

though boudoir doesn't need to be on a bed either does it?

One of these days I'm going to get curious to look into it from a how to perspective.

*meanwhile my regular portrait photography needs work*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Did he say that?? In the story thingy?

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

No, he said that when we talked him through breaking up with Casey.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Oooooo

Leanna noooooo

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

> slow motion zoom in on Ethan.
> Ethan turns around snapback
> "Girls love bad boys."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

this is _nightmare fuel_

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

*turns Ethan into a meme face for being a douche*

I blame myself for this. You see, I was thinking the other day that if Leanna drinks (i don't know if she does), we could extend an offer to join us st paddys. She local, probably been there before having lived in sussex before. 

Then the universe caught wind of that and immediately had to pair a single woman up. You see, I only have couple friends. And the options were limited. So the universe directed her and Ethan together.

QED: I blame myself. Poor Leanna.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

gasp no

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I mean, if that's *actually* the case I can just jump now. But it's not.

I can see Leanna going to for the big bad Ethan.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

REALLY

eugh

no fun no fun, big bad boy types are LAME

theyre too intimidating to date

hue intimi-DATE-ing hue

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

My guess would be some people like having an assertive SO.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

eh probably

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Leanna drinks

She drank on NYE

I thought she said she was asexual tho??????

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Not saying it's some mystic messenger stuff, but Leanna strikes me as the passive type.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Ethan won't like that

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I commented on this yesterday, and last weekend I thought.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

ethan, thinking hes gonna get more tail now that hes single

HA

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

That you think she's lying?

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

She posted a few things that seemed a bit counter intuitive to the ace as fuck thing.

Not lying, lying implies negative connotation.

But yeah, I guess.

I don't care if she is 'ace as fuck' or not, just can see a scenario where she isn't truly.

Let me pose this <@!245270932602486784> :

Would Savage Ethan be inviting her over at all if he didn't think he could get with her?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Ye all I mean is Ethan definitely has a requirement for sex in his relationships and it's part of the reason he was not  happy with Casey

Side note: they only live about 50 mins away from each other

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Does that contribute that much?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

No

That's why it's a side note?

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Wasn't sure.

She went to tech, so she's probably well adjusted to the 'everyone I want to visit lives an hour away or more' thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Yea exactly what I mean is they live close enough to hang out often if they wanted

Don't fall for the fuck boi tactics Leanna

Aaaaaaahhhhhh

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

> slow motion zoom in on Ethan.
> Ethan turns around snapback
> "Can't be a nice guy... Nice guys finish last."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Ethaaaaaannnnuhghghbdjdbhshdbjd

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I can't even spin it in a way where Leanna be using him for Props.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Yea.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-13*

Ethan also has a problem with the magnum condoms he drops for his magnum dong 
I suspect Leanna is probably asexual, or at least close to it, (has super low sex drive and super sexual sensitivity maybe?) 
So that won't go well at all lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Lmao whaaaat? (About the condom thing not the asexual thing)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-13*

Did we not tell you about this

One time at what I think was Georgia's BDay 
Ethan came upstairs to the kitchen with Georgia and I 
And complained about his 8 inch cock and how it was too big

(He had been drinking and it was late at night)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Ommmgggg

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-13*

He explained it made it harder for him to climax, and that it hurt Casey so sex was hard

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

And this is the magnums he talking about??

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Where did this transition come from damn.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

From Ethan being a dick

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-13*

Something about how he used to always get some and his struggles with his relationship if I remember correctly

Heard a lot of his sexual exploits that night

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Lmao wtf ethan

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Remember when I was confused about how people though I'm secretive?

If Ethan is open book I'm okay with secretive.

Ethan is streaming.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-13*

Is Leanna there

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Ethan overly open though he the opposite end if the spectrum

And yes she is

Oh no be just started a live video

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

OOPS I DROPPED MY MAGNUM CONDOM FOR MY MONSTER DONG

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Did he like drop it on purpose??

I wanna know what the stream is but I don't wanna enter it

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I popped in. He has it aimed at the tv, game streaming.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

Oh yea I saw they were playing Halo and overwatch

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Guys I'm going to start a prop business and do nothing but stream on twitch, while being a dick to my employees. Girls dig that right.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

"girls love jerks"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

"Nice guys finish last right"

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

I mean. He's right.

Except in the case where the girl is making the moves.

_looks at Jess and Georgia. _

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-13*

Lol no they dont

On both accounts

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Eeeeh.

*I'm not even a nice guy so it doesn't matter*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-13*

üò± <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Like, Erik is nice guy. A 50 year old man called me salty.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-13*

Wut

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

What do those have to do with each other?

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Salty isn't an appealing trait to be know for?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

no i mean the statement about erik and the salty statement

**Bill** - *2018-03-13*

Erik is a nice guy. I'm a salty guy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-13*

ah

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

You can be nice AND salty!

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

~~and still finish last!~~

I should come with a trigger warning.

I'm just being depressing for the sake of it.



**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Hey girls like it if you finish last <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

BAE

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-14*

It's true tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

I WAS GONNA SAY THAT EARLIER

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

<#361532671714656266> in sync over here

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Both people have to be playing or this story ends in a very bad place.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

_table 1 still has a lot to do if they're üé∂ going üé∂ to catch up to table 2_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

y u gotta be like that?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Jess let's make secret plans that don't involve one of our characters being racist :p

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

G A S P

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

lets get our character super close so that we can brag about it üòõ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-14*

DO IT

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

YEAH DO IT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

üôÑ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

üòè fuckin got em

Tom and I planned this all along of course

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

I want to see Aldus reaction to Eliran being like "nokri can go duck off"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-14*

üòè

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Jes write ur post üíï

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

I'd have said "gotta start with dating" but that doesn't apply to some people. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

https://i.imgur.com/mzpDxt4_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium and did I not say this was me?

If Aldus is Zen, does that make Eliran Jumin?

Lol Nokri can be Elizabeth the third.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

na eliran is zen XD

i mean i gues aldus is kinda zenny too but

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Wasn't Zen a wolf boy?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*



oh tru

depends if your talking personality or appearance

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Nokri is Jumin

?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

na i disagree lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Well Eliran definitely can't be jumin if she Elizabeth the 3rd

Eliran hates her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

exactly

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Aldus is Jaehee and Eliran is Zen

Cause Aldus has to put up with her bullshit for his livelihood and Eliran hates her and will have nothing to do with it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

yea but nokris not rich XD

nokri is yoosung XD

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Omg

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

na yoosungs too nice

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Fuck yoosung

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

nokri is RIKA

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

And not literally

How

Everybody loves rika

So much so the idea of the MC being able to do what she does gives them a boner

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

i dont know that much about her but i saw some spoilers that she not so nice

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Rika is *wonderful*?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

ü§∑

i read that she was abusive to V

could have been misinformed

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

I can see Nokri being Rika

There a lot goin on with her

How Nokri sees herself: how the RFA sees Rika
How Nokri really is: how Rika is

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Damn.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

yea thats like the only thing i read about her before avoiding more spoilers

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

Get ready for a roller coaster woooooo

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Yeah, so might want to work on that Marisa, cause like I can't stop Eliran and Aldus from murdering her.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Chaotic neutral

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

EVIL

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

Every villain is lemons

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

spoke to Grey Towers. Will be free to go there, but do have to do the paper work.

also requires picking a date in advance, and doing so memorial day is advisable since they don't do tours before then.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

this is for georgia?

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Originally.

It's a cool place though, so...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

WHOOPPEE

Wait doing it on Memorial Day or before Memorial Day?

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

before.

That will be interesting to schedule, obviously.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

ye im game and i can prob do it

itd probably be after practice shoot

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Yeah, we'd want that. Figure it out later while I'm at my desk.

<@&392353143540940801> convince me to suggest we go to Buffalo Wild Wings tonight.

I'm really tired, but I somehow still kinda want to? I don't understand it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

I dont have work tomorrow, unless i wanna go in for an afternoon shift (i probably wont)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-14*

Jennas post swayed you i see

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

but i also have to ~~not play league~~ work out and shower because i can hang out

but hanging out would be fun üòÑ

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Yeah, I was thinking it before and I saw Jenna's post and I was like "well I mean."

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

I am allready laying down and pm in for the night I'm tired as hell and I think we might be getting pizza

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

I kinda figured you would tbh. You'd have to leave pretty soon Georgia, not exactly a short trip.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

~~we could all hang out on league~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Me and Jess don't do drugs.

But yes, you're probably better doing that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

i mean i could skip the work out

it would be bad tho cause i already wasnt running enough cause of finals ehhhh

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

I mean, I wouldn't bail on you if you did come this way. Just like... you'd have to get here.

It's a tad impromptu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

yeee

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Nice enthusiasm. Be fun to see you. But you know. Don't put yourself out.

**Dave** - *2018-03-14*

run all the way here, it's a win win

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Then double it to get home.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-14*

I can hang tomorrow night üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

If you want to come into the city.

Going to IBM tomorrow afternoon, so I likely won't be done for the day till 5ish. I miss the early train.

(City IBM office)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-14*

Jess technically has league installed

as i said >w>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*



Mark can just adopt me tbh

He's just all around such a cool dude

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

That's amazing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

Do I try to run the animenext RWBY Photoshoot, at least for Saturday...?

Or do I take a break

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Up to you. Might be worth taking colossal east too though.

Person running it last year seemed more on the "someone needs to" bent.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

>w> I will take that bullet

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Mm. You can put me down for them too.

let me know if you want to.

We have to pick a date for Grey Towers so I can send in the form too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJhP4lhgqCe-heik6JtAQQRRVZYNxmmOzhjyJyd79q0/edit?usp=sharing heres my calendar so we can cross reference

when do you think youre most likely free

May 13th i could probably do

finals are done by the 11th i believe

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

13th is mother's day.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

GOSH frick i havent put any holidays in

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

why don't use a calendar application...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i dont like them lol

april 8th, that wrestlemania is at night if thats any help

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

I'm coming up from Rowan, that afternoon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

poop

day before memorial day? üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

you want to do both days castle point?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

hmmm i guess i didnt particularly care no

it was just nice cause i knew a lot of friends would be there

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Then going is a good idea.

memorial day weekend runs into the place opening tours again, which if we avoid we get freeish reign of the place.

(side note, Weezer is July 20th)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

whoop thank

and oh its memorial day WEEKEND not memorial day that they start

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

probably.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

could say screw the cosplay workshop day

no one really gets productive then anyways

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

The days (before memorial day) I can do are:
April 21 (your with Hal)
April 28 (your working)
April 29 (kinda, We wouldn't be able to get there till the afternoon, that the day I go on that wolf preserve photoshoot. Earliest start is 2/3. AND workshop day.)
May 12 (your working)

Too much going on on the 29th, I'll strike that.

we can go into the summer after that, but if we're doing that I want to call back and see how it'll play out when we're there.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

eugh summer photoshoots and heat make me melt

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

especially as Weiss.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

may, at least, im at the end of the school year

but i havent started salesperson stuff yet

hm hm

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

it's up to you. it is your photoshoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i mean im willing to say fuck it to cosplay work on the 29th

but if the wolf retreat butts up against it too much then thats irrelevant

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

We can try, though I'm a bit hesitant. Workshopping may just be hanging out time, but sometimes there's nothing wrong with that. friends helping friends detox from the crunch.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

ehhhhh yeah

idk the lack of productivity when the hangout gets too big usually frustrates me

<5 people is usually productive

most of the time

greater than that is a good hangout, but sucks at getting things done

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

well you plan around that. üòõ

It's up to you.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-15*

Yeah agreed

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

im game to do the 29th if you think you can do it

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

alright. I send the woman an email, I want to confirm how late we can be on the premises. Earliest we could be there is 2, if the wolf preserve doesn't run over and traffic is good.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

wait

is this your wolfie photo thing or snother thing?

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

photo thing.

Event being run by the photo shop in Fairfield.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

kay check that date then

thank for your patience in finding time for me and my somehow busy self

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

If it's not in delaware, there's a 90% chance I'm involved in the thing you're doing.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

truuuue

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Did anyone else want to do photos there?

Cause I have to put an estimate of people involved on the form.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

did u pick a date?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

29th

assuming that all plans fall into place but thats the date were shooting for

OF APRIL

april 29th

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

that's the weekend before zenkai, ill probably be working on stuff also idk which cosplay

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

its like a castle-y thingy

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

You have connecticon down on your calendar too, so that's locked for you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i have off for it, essentially

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

yea i know lol im the one that came up the location originally

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

but no money has been put towards it

O RLY thank u jess ur too kind

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

or at least i commented on it at some point

i could be wrong, but its near my paretns house so ive known abou ti for years

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

indeed, but you *intend* to go.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

I dont think so no

id like to go see it but i dont have a cosplay for that setting

at least i dont think i do

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

I meant to Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

ye i intend to go

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

If you want to come to grey towers to see the place you can. Think the inside is closed though.

does... anyone else?

I have the last day to put into a con weekend, so I can.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

intend to go to connecticon?

hal probably, assuming he can get the time off

potentially ryan or reiley

i feel like most everyone is too focused on animenext or zenkai to really consider it

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

of the two hotels Connecticon recommends, one only has a kings, and the other bundles up (thursday to sunday I assume for this, given distance? Or friday?) to 680.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

orz thats rough buddy

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

wait I fucked up, old one.

510.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

i feel like i stayed a little farther away once and it was like 200 for the two nights total

lemme look

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I mean, it's 148 a night which is a really good price for cons. Only Zenkai is lower.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

theres a comfort inn (thats honestly a personal fav when it comes to hotels farther from a con center thats 125 a night

430 for the weekend and includes breakfast/parking

its only a king but ill bring DA MATTRESS

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

hmm.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

https://www.choicehotels.com/connecticut/east-hartford/comfort-inn-hotels/ct138/rates?checkInDate=2018-07-12&checkOutDate=2018-07-15

heres the site if you wanted to explore

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Audible sigh as Mark didn't plan it on a weekend I have plans.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-15*

You don't have to go lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-15*

Of course I do. That castle is gorgeous.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-15*

WOOHOO CASTLE COSPLAY

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

Anime Japan is open from 10:00-5:00 on Saturday and Sunday. tickets for each day are separate, plus cosplaying is a separate cost.

should I attend both days, one to explore and one to cosplay, or should I try and fit it all in one day but risk not seeing everything/not buying anything/not cosplaying?

i was only going to attend one day.... but i think i might shell out $25 for the extra day.......
because the first hour will probably be spent in line, and then I'll spend another hour putting on the costume, and half an hour taking the costume off, so that's already 2.5 out of 7 hours of the con, assuming the lines are short. I'll likely have to wait longer to get in and then wait in line to cosplay.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

_spend maximum money_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

*if I go two days then I can buy things without worrying about running out of room because i'm also carrying a cosplay*

**Bill** - *2018-03-16*

Says Georgia, who complains about me telling her to treat yo self all the time.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

i don't want to spend money
but anime japan

ugh plus it'll cost at least $15 for transportation

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

not going to the con in cosplay?

you change there?

**Bill** - *2018-03-16*

you have to apparently.

Japanese cosplay is more restrictive than american.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

viva la america

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

the weather should be nice but if it rains one day and I go two days then I can choose the sunny day to cosplay
yeah you can't travel in cosplay thats bad

they won't even let you enter if you're already in cosplay, they'll turn you away

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

what do they do if you travel in cosplay

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

judge you harshly

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

~~are you saying that doesnt happen here~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

omg I saw a foreigner dude in a mad hatter cosplay walking around yesterday. no idea what for. he was getting crazy stares.

there's usually a giant dressing room they put everyone in and you get like 1 square foot of space to change and put on makeup

no mirror :sobbu:

oh tfw no sobbu emote here. it's üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-16*

o ya id do as much make up as possible beforehand

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-16*

ye

i wonder how long it takes people to apply bodypaint in the mega dressing rooms

they're very strict on phones which is nice. not allowed to use any phones or have them out at all in the changing room because of japan's problems with voyeurs and creep shots. people are not shy in the changing room. but that means you absolutely gotta bring your own mini mirror.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

People asking if there's an organized list of all shoots at Zenkai...... ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

now that would be taking on more than you need to.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

It wouldn't be too bad, just makin a google doc

It would ensure that RWBY doesn't butt up against anyone

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

The other organizers aren't going to be as organized as you though. They'll change times and locations, not update, stuff like that.

You don't want to be on the hook for the doc not having an update you have no idea about.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

Truuue

The disorganization just makes me saaad

I meaaan Katsucon used to use a google doc and it worked out welllll

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

and Katsu is currently a mess organization wise.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

Well that's cause they tried to do an official registration but before that some random person volunteered to open a google doc with all the shoots on it

Otakon did the same thing

(Before they switched locations)

That's funny that the unofficial organization worked better than the official one wow

Ok I didn't post it in the group, but look how nice this spreadsheet be

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FVsQRp2gAwsJcaVuHWK8fc2DFBXMvb86jafq8Ulysn4

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

As long as you don't try to maintain it...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

I woooont

I'll give it a day to figure out if I'll even do it

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

I could see value in posting it and letting others fill in shoots.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

Yeah that's what I planned

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

are you meeting us at Kroghs or the house <@!228287793099440128> ?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-17*

probably the house

would just be easier

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-17*

Only 4 people fit in our car tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-17*

hmmm you right...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-17*

When I come, should I park in the street? So people can still use the driveway lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

I'll park where I was last time, it's just Dave's car to keep track of.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-17*

<@351785752197201920>  can you move the car out to the street?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-17*

yes 2 other cars can fit in my driveway besides mine,

nah i dont think theres a point can im parked really close to the bushes i dont think anyone else wants that since they hit that car every time i leave lmao

i guess theoretically someone else could drive thier car and i could drive it back since kroughs is not far

unless the person that drives isnt gonna get intoxicated enough

since dave is going home I could put that on him >w>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-17*

Idk

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

That'd be the only benefit to Georgia meeting us there, as a sober driver...

If Krogh's actually has valet parking free, they'll figure out where to put her truck.

Depends on Dave.

whose probably napping again.

**Dave** - *2018-03-17*

yes. i sleep

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

what your plan later Davo?

**Dave** - *2018-03-17*

meet at toms, if i need to drive to the bar, i will

**Bill** - *2018-03-17*

coo. I'm heading over a bit earlier, but Georgia should be there by 7 and we'll head out then.

**Dave** - *2018-03-18*

the escape was at 4, correct?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-18*

440

**Bill** - *2018-03-18*

Well. I suppose you had time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-18*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-18*

Woooo!

Thanks for visiting üëå üëå üëå

**Dave** - *2018-03-18*

i havent used paypal in forever, there a fee subtracted from what you're given?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-18*

If you use a card you have to pay a fee to transfer,if you use a direct bank account it's free

**Dave** - *2018-03-18*

yup, clicking "next" said no fee.  i r bad

**Bill** - *2018-03-18*

Ye, PayPal is PayPal. I want to use Zelle but no one has that.

They kept having the con the same weekend as Zenkaikon *even after we made measures to ensure that wouldn‚Äôt happen*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

lmao yeah

that was the most stupid thing

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-20*

The con chairs had a meeting and they put a lottery place each year to decide which con could announce the dates first
And cpac was like lol nah we‚Äôll hold it the same weekend anyway and both cons can suffer <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-20*

20 dolla for one day

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

I mean, CPAC is much bigger than Kotori despite being a small con.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

yeah much bigger

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

Just don't think this is Kotori in Hoboken.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

i like CPAC too ive always liked it

i stopped liking kotori after a while oop

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

same with us.

Though the staying in my dorm helped quite a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

billiam is grey towers, is that entirely a private shoot

like NO ONE ELSE there?

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

mm... Maybe?

Some staff for grey towers, probably at the visitor area. we can stay past when the close the gates though.

until sundown.

I don't think it's open to the public that day though, so the only other people around would be other people with requests?

why?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

i was wondering if the request system was like 1 person per day or somethin

i dont wanna spook anyone with my weiss-ness lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

nah it'll be fine.

Maybe they'll just think it's a wedding dress photoshoot. XP

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

LMAO YEAH

or im the toothfairy, according to a small child at zenkai last year

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

niiice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

so we're basically doing a mix of weiss stuff?

the new trailer with the ponytail on the back, and reg v1 weiss?

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

Actually yeah, the original idea of the grey buildings was v1 Weiss.

Forgot about that.

yeah. We'll get content for days because we'll have trained up. üëç

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

wooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

conteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeent

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

you can woo less, it's solo content.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

[smaller woos]

are we also doing the bloody eye white trailer part?

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

we can.

whatever sounds cool. It's you time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

Nah let's focus on the other two

Also good news my finals don't conflict with Zenkai

Bad news they're so badly timed



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-20*

ouchie

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

The 9th is going to miserable for you.

Oh bless, they aren't literally back to back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

I'm gonna try to reschedule multivariable

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-20*

11pm jeez

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

Yeah Rutgers does them in time blocks like that

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

and that's one you'll actually take time for.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

Yeah I'll smash Foreign Policy and Causes of War

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

hell ye you will.

will have to celebrate the end of the semester.

and we'll have plenty of time at Grey Towers, so getting a collection of idea together wouldn't be a bad idea. I wasn't kidding when I said I might want to scrap the whole planning documents things. Maybe I need to trust myself to be more creative without safety nets.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

We'll see what comes of our practice session at da park

**Bill** - *2018-03-20*

more thinking of larger theme things. Like 'v1 trailer' or 'bloody eye', stuff like that.

So are you going to come with us Thursday then Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-20*

Mmmm good question

I have to reschedule my math first and then I'll see

They may make me take it early, in which case I don't wanna Pre-suppose anything too soon

ALSO

they don't explain the logic behind the latter, so it quite likely is biased or overly simple. The shadowbanning they explian though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

the venue has kinda craptastic lighting indoors anyways

its only good outside

and even that is a view of the street

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

Which works for fallout, they have cities.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

yeah

not great for weiss yang or pyrrha

i know ill finish my suit by kindacon, i hope i can finish the armor too

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

The problem is you have awesome friends to hang out with on the weekend.

RIP.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

exactly ;3

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

chalk one thing up to workshopping days.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

eh i can sew during the week

tuesdays and fridays my classes end by noon

so next tuesday ill do some hardcore sewing hopefully, and work on armor friday at home

sakura sunday will be nice cause ill be max so itll be super lowkey

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

hmm.

I was going to say if the sakura's are bloom Weiss would look good too, but... For some reason Max and sakuras feel right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

yeah its very ethereal

v reflective

v #deep

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

Ethereal...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

light and emotional lol

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

those work better.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-23*

üëå too much sewing stresses me out, I gotta do it in shifts. It's.. odd

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

makes sense

im that way with foam

i can sit down and sew for 8 hours but foam im like

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

Dy~ing~

**Dave** - *2018-03-23*

Who's going to awesomecon in DC?



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-23*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-23*

wow why do their hair colors math their characters?

**Dave** - *2018-03-23*

It was simple geometrics

**Bill** - *2018-03-23*

So much stuff in DC...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-24*

If Lindsay is touring cons then is Michael watching their kid or are they all traveling together  :0



Goblin slayer and Sachi-iro one room news. Eyyy

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-24*

>w>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-24*

If I stand in this line for 3 hours and shell out money I might be able to get an autographed goblin slayer book. Maybe. Probably not but maybe.

I‚Äôll find out! <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>



Look at all this nerd junk I got for free

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-24*

Geek week posted their photos from the event



Hal said he looks like a fan meeting a cosplayer lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-24*

Lmao trueeee but still cute

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-25*

The only thing missing is a hover hand and the look would be complete
He has avoided the fan look‚Ñ¢

The line was short so I went and bought a couple signed manga, whatever the booth had left that was autographed (there was like an hour left in the con and like 3 people in line so I don't think people were really dying to get their hands on these series), and I'll be sending them to the US later this week for zenkai's charity auction if anyone is interested <:lenny:395307171539189760>
shipping is weird though and either gets there in 24 hours or 5 months so if somehow it's not there for zenkai it'll be at whatever the next reputable con charity auction is.
I don't trust animenext's so not that one.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-25*



DOES THIS PERAON HAVE ANYTHING BETTER TO DO

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

I blocked them.



Beach cosplay day is live. and I even got invited.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

HOW DO I GET INVITEDDDD

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Georgia messaged the host to invite me last year, I'll check.

Yup, same deal, they have the ban list still.

although the invite button is there, so...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

So maybe it's public this year

Maybe they heard me complain

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

listed as a private event.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Somehow

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

I'm asking her if it's a mistake or not.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

I uh am not invited whoops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

wuuuuuut?

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*



you are.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

the plot thickens

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

https://www.facebook.com/events/1511479535597210/?notif_t=plan_user_invited&notif_id=1522087447906544

I dunno if you can open that link or not.

think invite being open was a mistake.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

i cannot

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

You wouldn't be able to no. It's based of the invite list of the event.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

oh ok wasnt sure

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

was indeed a mistake, still an approved invite event.

*Dumps BNE's information on Sarah to go through adding*

Well. Meh.

Might as well promo it in BNE first, only get the interested people.

Since the ban list thing makes it a pain.

(did tell her to add you two Jess)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Why do they make it PRIVATE ugh

Stop being weenies my god

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Looks like a copy pasta event description too.

Not everyone has a safety Hal.

Admittedly the paperwork does ruin the event's reach, but.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Yeah but if they run an event they should be prepared for creepers to show up

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

creepers? in the *anime* fandom? ***Never***.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

So the ban list makes sense, but they make it private to make it so that the creepers don't even find out about when the event is

Which makes it impossible to promote

And that's why their attendance is sucking butt

If they just made it public, and were prepared to oust the creepers that inevitably show up from year to year

Then they wouldn't have to worry about people not coming????

It's very frustrating to me as a cosplay events hostess

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

can't oust someone from a public space...

Though iirc one of their bans found out anyway last year so.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

I mean they can get security if there's people harassing cosplayers

Sarah tends to be sensitive though, not gonna lie, so shes probably also quick to slap a creeper label on most guys

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

In the description she did say cops will likely be around.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I mean, I was surprised I got reinvited at all so...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Yeah so like, cosplay beach day 2014 had 150 people, last year they had 40

Like how does that happen

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

I wouldn't go to  this without you or Jess, tbh. They set the stigma in the air for creepers that I'd spend the whole time not talking to anyone in case they want to point the witch hunt my way.

But I'm reserved outside my ~~friend harem~~ circle.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

ill take any excuse to go to the beach

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

(She added you guys)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

yea just got the notifcation

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

But I feel like if I went without ~~ratio~~ a female presence I'd be tagged as creepy loner by default with this group.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Possibly

Which is why I'm skeptical of Sarah's list

A dude sitting alone with a camera automatically puts red flags for her

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

Of course that's like, one of my biggest fears, so it weights a tad heavily.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Sarah's nice, but her oversensitivity has always been an issue

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

liiiike I said, surprised I got an invite back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

You did take pics for her at kogarafest

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

Why does it need to be with private and a ban list

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

She probably didn't forget that fact

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

Why not just a ban list

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

THATS WHAT I SAY

Jess is great, realizing these same things

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

I was about to say, that's probably why she remembers me.

If the person they ban can see the event, they ignore the 'banned' list to begin with and still show up.

control of information.

but this didn't work last year so.

Better idea is to message the actual event location/details to the members of the guest list who aren't banned close to the event. They only have to give information to the people they want, 'going' to the event or not.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

Yeah but that's not gonna happen

You can't expect that in this day and age

And they always host it around the same week in July and refuse to accomodate other Saturdays so if the creepers have any sense, they'll figure it out

(They lost attendance one time cause they scheduled the same weekend as two cons and refused to reschedule)

I have a couple bones to pick with cosplay beach day, it's a hosting disaster in my humble opinion

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

"can't expect that in this day and age": You've been spending too much time around me again. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

/steals portions of bills personality by mistake

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-26*

Put that back

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

it is rather messy. Best thing to do is go with your friends *(pyrrha voice: hello again)* and let them crash and burn everything around you; you'll have fun either way because you're with your friends.

Well, we're both Leos.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

/hesitantly puts parts of bills personality back

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

"hesitantly" what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-26*

/still wants to keep these traits but listening to jess is priority

oh my gooood i dont wanna be in saltine cracker class

**Bill** - *2018-03-26*

eh. Keep being you.

If you need salty I'll fill in for you.

I've got plenty to spare.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-27*

zenkai said they had the first part of accepted panels Feb 3

why havent they updated with the second round, its been two months

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-27*

they're doing panel acceptions in rounds too??? who decided that was a good idea and what is the purpose

time to go stalk the staff facebook

ain't nothing about panels but deuce has been pushing a pre-con amv screening at his house
that seems strange. i guess helping the preliminary judging?

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

<@!245270932602486784> Where is the planning for that team RWBY shoot with Leanna/Snow/Katsu-Blake. Leanna asked about bee photos and I said lets roll into the prior.

unless the prior isn't happening?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

Gotchu <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

I believe we all said 5:30 was a good time

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

saturday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

Yee

You have been added to the group on Instagram too

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

I saw. This conference call is worse than a liberal arts lecture.

I can't manage to tune them out and do something else entirely.

5:30 works.

so did Leanna just add daydream without checking with you?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

Sorta

Better than duchess tho

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Explains why Grey got shot down so quickly, definitely don't want to turn someone down when they already got into the chat. *nod nod*

and *sooo* much better than duchess.

I'm thinking a friday night thing, since free weekends have become terribly scarce in April. The 6th or the 13th? The 13th *is* the day before Kindacon, and Kindacon is the day before Sakura Sunday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

13th!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

Either works but I don't think we are going to kindacon

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

~~I didn't convince you to do that?~~

Cause I thought everyone was doing Kinda, then coming back to your place, and then leaving for sakura sunday.

whose doing what now, I'm confused.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

im committed to kinda and sakura

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

I meant me and Tom not all of us

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

I know. I also can't remember what Hal is doing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

ughhh accidentally double booked us for that day

Fuck

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

I only know Georgia cause Georgia is doing everything, same as me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

hal was a maybe

depended on work and if the family lets him have da car

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

I mixed up kagora and kinda so I made other plans for that day

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

I mean, if you didn't buy tickets so be it right?

You aren't out anything, other than spending time with *Muwah*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

Nah I didn't buy tickets

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

[smol voice] and moi

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

~~who are we kidding they just want to see Georgia~~

But you two are doing Sakura Sunday right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

I believe so

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Kindacon is whatever, only thing I'm concerned with figuring out is carpooling to Sakura.

**Dave** - *2018-03-28*

whenever is fine with me, just let me know what everyone else decides

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

If Hal's up, it's a moot point, probably better to take two cars to start with. If he's not, Georgia was going to ride with us, but driving back to her place and then back to us the next day to do that would be silly. Originally we had talked sleep over Saturday to make that work, but if you guys can't host that we have to adjust. (and you are *not* obligated to don't even feel guilty saying no if you have to or so help me)

Quite frankly it's a moot point, Georgia can easily crash at my place too and we meet up here and go to sakura sunday. But more people is more fun right.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

Idk what time we are going to be home that night. I still have to discuss with Tom what we are doing and before I double book again. We are not doing anything the 7th or 8th right?

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

If you're asking me, nope. That weekend I'll be visiting Andoru, Jen, Jeremy, Allison, and shooting for Flora.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

ya i have work and wrestlemania to do

whoopee

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

aight lets sort this out

so i told the dnd guis that lets just decide on the 14th for now and see what happens specifically stating that i wasnt sure

so the plan for kinda was that everyone comes here only if Hal isnt up?

i mean ofc hal could come here too thats not a problem

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

no stinkys allowed :V

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

wed probably out the couch bed then

we've left it closed cuz there was no point

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

we never really talked about Hal, with Hal it just makes a 5 man car pool a bit much. Only change to the plan I'd make is Hal/Georgia drive to Sakura Sunday and I'll drive us three.

from your place.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

are all of them in morris town?

both cons*

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Sakura sunday is in philidelphia boi.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

ah kk

so is kindacon a pay at the door kinda thing?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

I poured you a coffee babe

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

or did you guys buys tickets already

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

i think you have to pay online

theres "limited tickets" at the door

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

kk

just trying to figure out if I need to definetely cancel dnd and what were doing

i have no problem doing that if were definetly doing a stay at my house

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

doesnt that depend on if yall are on board for kindacon, and then if yall wanna host guests?

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

I got my ticket yeah.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

we were on board for kinda ye, and ofc i never have a problem hosting guests

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

TIME 2 BUY MORE DONUTS

anyways so ya thats okay then

hal is the only variable

tho hes not going to sakura sunday cause he definitely has work

well, more likely than not

hes worked every sunday i know of

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Such is retail.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

hmm okee, but if hes up... if you guys stay at my house... how will he get home then

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

So sleep over between kinda and sakura. Are you guys doing D&D or kinda? (Also tell D&D to come to kinda obviously)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

lmao i already did that

i told em that we double booked and need to reschedule

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

uhhh assuming no escape room friday, satuday we rendezvous at the con,

you three in one car, me and hal in another

then saturday after con he can leave and i just hop in with yall for sakura sunday

o but then i need my car to get home

HMHMHMHM difficult

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

yeah exactly

same thought process

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

Uber :V

yeah idk id have to take a separate car to the con then

and then we could all still carpool to sakura sunday

and then get back to Vault Garrity‚Ñ¢

and i can head home from there

and bill can drop yall at home and go back home himself

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

We are not going to kagora right?

That's the 21

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

**were** not I dont believe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

Ok good

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

No ones going to kogara.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

Ok good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

ye im not goin

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

We went to the one in fall which I'd consider again since that's a slow month for cons.

November or October.

K. So plan is as it was the Halim variable.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Righto, then back to the original thing, escape room good for either the 6th or 13th? (We can book further out too, I'm just looking at what I can actually do in the near future.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

6th works but i have work the 7th

which just makes no sleepover

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Well, I‚Äôm traveling the 7th so I‚Äôd be going home anyway.

Princeton for the photo shoot, then Rowan, etc.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

13th seems more fun

but jams up against kindacon

which would mean sleepover TIMES TWO COMBO

which depends on jess and tom

and also just generally on if we feel overscheduled

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

~~i always feel over scheduled lately~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Do you want to do the escape room at all?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-28*

Sure it it's a Friday night it shouldn't be a problem

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-28*

yeah its weekends being blocked out as of lately

but other then easter Kinda is our last plan til Zenkai

/sakura

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

/punts escape room til after kindacon

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Mm, I‚Äôm quite busy in April. I dig it.

Post kinda?

21st is a Saturday and iirc Georgia will be in Delaware. 27th?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Yup.

(Side note: Sakura Sunday has a 10 dollar ticket to enter.)

Can pick up online.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-28*

ive had the kindacon and sakura tickets open on my laptop for like 500 years

**Bill** - *2018-03-28*

Sometimes I just see zenkais accepted panel list and want to kick the Internet

_three my little pony panels_

**Bill** - *2018-03-29*

Artoria Grey posted a line up in one of the Zenkai groups and basically said 'contact me if you want to shoot' and I'm still like... eh.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

Do itttt

**Bill** - *2018-03-29*

That's not a good way to make friends, it's a way to make clientele... at least that's the feeling I get. I don't need clients.

oooh, Rebecca is running Zenkai's BNHA.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-29*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

sakura sunday, so many cosplay photographers are posting about shooting at sakura sunday

but saying cosplay isnt required

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

oh?

I'm not surprised tbh. It's not entirely a cosplay event, so you get alot of other people there.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-30*

Andru come hither i have a question
was last year's otakon the con where we went to the shady roadside Checker's stand to eat in the ten billion degree heat and the cashier thought my elf ears were real, or was it the one where we somehow wound up an hour ahead of the rest of the carpool and had to wait at Wendy's and some kid started yelling at us from his car as it was stopped at a red light

**Bill** - *2018-03-30*

@ him stupid.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-03-30*

I really hope Jake doesn't like Casey. If he does he's being strung along like no ones business. Or maybe they're a covert couple, which I'd be okay with.

Actually nope, I'm straight up rooting for Jake x Casey.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-30*

I think... Casey might be in some sort of relationship with NojuCosplay?

I just.. don't know exactly what it is?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-30*

I'm wondering that too

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-31*

Anyways I ship it cause they seem to be cute cosplay gays

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

*slow dab* hey kids we should watch angel beats the night before kindacon so everyone's hearts can be ripped out simultaneously ~~and I can drag people into cosplay it with me~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

Ohh yeeee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Gotta make tom and Jess cosplay another precious couple <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

~~Or Violet Evergarden because I need to be hugged watching that~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

Who Hinata and ....yui? Is that thier names?

It's been so long

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

YA HINATA AND YUI

or Jess can be angel

But I dun wanna fight Jess

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

Truuuu

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

Jess's thing: emotionless girls for cosplays.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

IS IT

SHE HAS WHITE HAIR

Tom who would you have wanted to be anyways

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

~~TK~~

We all want to be TK.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-31*

Huh?

~~i dont want that to be my thing~~

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

Georgia said you could cosplay Angel from Angel Beats. Angel is also an emotionless girl like 2Butt.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

ALSO WHITE HAIR

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

So I made the joke that'll be your thing.

ALSO swords.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-31*

But I don't like being emotionlessüò≠

Also I did 2b more so I'd have something to go with Tom's Adam

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

~~to convince tom to have long white hair~~

YUI is prob better than

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

~~and cause you wanted to show off that leggie~~ üòè

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

She's peppy

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

Then you can do Hinata x Yui. Yui is Nora with a death metal kick.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-31*

Ooo neat

ngl, if angel beats becomes a group and I can order the uniform online I'd do that. I always wanted the uniform blazer, and I can pass as Matsushita with no effort.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-31*

Well I haven't even seen it yet so let's not get ahead of ourselves

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

if you don't like it your banned from the server though. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

OH YEAH YOU CAN BEAT UP TOM

assuming he's hinata

Gotta get the bae on otonashi

Death metal Nora is such a good description wow

Oh there's Shiina too, aka irl hot topic

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

~~I think still describes Yui~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

ALSO TRUE



Wow I bought my Yuri outfit 3 years ago

Still fits <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

I need new thigh highs tho, mine were butchered for Pyrrha LOL

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

easy to pick up.

~~Just go to Hot Topic~~

everyone is irl hot topic.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Do they even have plain ones??

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

whew

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

I thought they just have stripes and edgy stuff

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

the suplex scene is the best

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

I really wouldn't know Georgia.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

yeah all hot topic stockings will be nerdy, striped and edgey

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

fine fine.

I only go to Hot Topic to look anyway.

*Whoops* now I'm listening to Girls Dead Monster.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

I can't wait to CRY AGAIN

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

m-maybeeee won't cry this time

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

/jump cut to watching angel beats, were all sobbing

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-03-31*

TWT

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-31*

When are we watching angel beats

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Friday night before kindacon is my suggestion

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-31*

When is that cause I don't think in convention dates

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-31*

Lol you can get plain thigh highs at like Kohl's or Walmart

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

April 14

**Bill** - *2018-03-31*

walmart: now catering to the nerd fetish community

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-03-31*

If you need thigh high socks though you'll probably have to go online

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-31*

hmmm hopefully I can come up...
work change things up and has me working saturday this week so I'm worried they'll do it next week too :c

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-03-31*

Oh noes plz don't do that work

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

<@184437198865563648> replying a few days late, but idk yet. I want to go but I think my job prevents it

Towards Sakura Sunday

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

Aaaah that sucks. üò¶

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Yeah I'm trying to see if I can work things out. My club is going

Cause we take people there

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

It's a perfect trip yeah.

I wonder how many people Andrew and I would recognize. üòÖ

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Prob no one but Malcolm

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

Lol yup

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Yea most people from my freshman year don't go anymore. Only returner you would know from last year is prob Malcolm. Everyone else is new (we have 80 members who come once in a while, 30 consistent according to our sign in)

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

That's the usual shtick with clubs.

Lots of one timers.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

No like the 80 are people who come to a lot of meetings, but not all

Including one timers we have 115 signed up

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

Shit girl. Way to break the records.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Lol thanks

It's a much better club than even last year tho so that's prob why

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

~~it's cause I graduated right~~ üòù

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Nah, I wish you could see how it's grown tho tbh

(it's cause matt isn't on eboard tbh)

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

Savage. But also true, I can tell.

I'd be great, just being off a Thursday and at Rowan somehow lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Lmao we meet on tuesdays

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

~~that's actually impossible~~

Just take a big selfie or something.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-04-01*

Lmao we do have some Thursday meetings too but yeah we changed format last year

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

How laid back is laid back at Zenkai?

I've got Schnees, Golden hour, and team RWBY Saturday, beyond doing the group shoot. Team RWBY is also going to involve bees, because lol Leanna. Monica messaged me about Saturday but like, I'm on a strict no burn out schedule for Zenkai after Katsu. 3/day feels about the cap for that...

outside of Nepotism anyway.

speaking of nepotism, Tom, Jess?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

I don't know what we are doing when but we are both running low on content ‚ô•Ô∏è

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

this is for Zenkai.

specifically.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

No I mean we don't have line up for zenkai yet because it depends on if leo is done

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

Ye, although we didn't get a ton out of the renora shoot at katsu. Could do some more but not if you are busy.

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

No, that wasn't optional.

The *only* issue I have with *moar renora* is an outdoorsy shoot is more fitting for the characters.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

Yeah tru

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

but we're doing Renora.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

~~babe what are we doing for sakura?~~

i wanna do the corny pocky game thing! cuz tom wouldnt do it with me yesterday üò¶ he said "theres no point if no ones taking pictures"

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

~~and now we know exactly why I'm the third wheel in your marriage~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

Get green tea and strawberry Pocky >~>

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

Wow Tom. Where ever will we find that at an Anime convention.

yeah, but I realize I also want a buffer for nepotism.

I'mma turn Monica down.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

tom do you think leos gonna be ready for zenkai?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

I would like it to be

But I'm still unsure if my wig will come in time

It'll either come eight in time or right after

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

thats ok your dying your hair blonde anyway!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

~~my bleashing my hair too~~ but ive been thinking about it for like 6 months

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

I've been trying to dye my hair blonder for over a year bruhhh

I got it highlighted back in December

Maybe January

Was taking baby steps

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

üëÄ Georgia literally said friday "Everyone should just become blondes".

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

Yeah no it's a table 2 thing

You wouldn't UNDERSTAND

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

~~jess is doing it too though~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

~~You told me to dye my hair no less~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-02*

She's defecting from table 1

No man Tom and I gotta coordinate

Soon we're gonna have matching NASA hoodies and toe socks

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-02*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-03*

if jim allows us to use the rink again üôè

I wanna do an old-fashioned homestuck meetup where we build a can town :3c

it seems like the last documented can town was built in 2016 *come on guys we can make the biggest and best can town*
I won't be there during thanksgiving but that would be a great time to do it because food distribution places always need donations at that time

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-03*

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

We've been making irl Weiss jokes for half a year though. She's even the heiress to company.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-03*

Hello Georgia my rich BFF  <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-03*

Heiress to the car dealership fortune

**Bill** - *2018-04-03*

Man, I thought the Georgia is Weiss joke was old news.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-03*

_as did I whoops_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-03*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-03*

oh ye we gotta buy too

wooopie

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

its still considered an advance rate price

12 dolla

then it goes up to 15 dolla

what time do we anticipate getting back from sakura?

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

poo

cause of snowdays, my math class added one more class, and i can either go friday 13th or sunday 15th

but its at night so

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

last I checked we weren't getting together on the 13th.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

the night before kindacon?

we had spitballed it i thought

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

You had suggested it, it never got talked about.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

oh okie that works out then lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

what time was the class sunday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

7:40-9 pm

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

that would be difficult I think... Last time hung around sakura sunday for a good 4 or 5 hours, and that was without the 2 hour drive down.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

yeee okay ill go to the friday session then

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

*Also fuck having to make up classes because of snow, isn't your fault*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

nah its 6:40-8

so one hour earlier

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

I'd have skipped the make up out of spite.

Which is a dumb decision, but I never said I was smart.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-06*

yeah no i cant afford to miss valuable info lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-06*

yeah, can't fuck with math classes.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-07*

üôÉ üôÉ

**Bill** - *2018-04-07*

Except when he doesn't do Chat. üôÉ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

So I have a wedding the Friday before CPAC

So I know we haven't done official planning for it yet, but I'm leaning more towards just going Sunday for this year

Cause I'll have the wedding stuff and it'll save $$$ not having a hotel

So I'm game to do starfire that day too then üòéüëâ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-07*

üòé

I honestly have no idea what we're doing lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

I know Jess was keen on being ~~hot topic~~ Raven

Tho there's no plans for CPAC yet ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-07*

Yeah, I'd do beast boy in a heartbeat if it wasn't for the green skin

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-07*

Dooooo ittttt

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

‚ú® I can help with body paint ‚ú®

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-07*

‚ú®

**Bill** - *2018-04-07*

Not that I have a preference either way, but Hoboken is daytrippable. No need for an overnight if you did want to do both days.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-07*

Yeah it's less that and moreso the wedding though

Cause everyone's gonna be getting LIT so

I'll be driver ü§ì

But it's somewhere far too so I might be getting a hotel with my bros idk

**Bill** - *2018-04-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

**Bill** - *2018-04-08*

Well I knew that. üòõ

Some buildings would be great for v Weiss trailer too.



Holy shit that's a FANTASTIC spot.

There's no panes, it's a little walkway.

Holder hall.

The weeb shop is still here.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-08*

Owo pretty

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

We kept that 2-5pm almost exactly.

That's pretty cool.

I'd have liked more photos of them out of cosplay, but it worked out this way.

Got really cold though.



<@!245270932602486784> Do they realize that's... where we said we were running our shoot? Like, why?

Why you do this.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

Ughhh humanity

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

I mean, by default we'll overshadow them by numbers alone.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

~~Black butler sucked and is dead as a fandom anyways...~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-09*

ow wow ok

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

Yeee

Like why would you claim that time slot without checking first.....

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

they *knew* the time.

They were one of the first people to join the event for RWBY, I think.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

people dont get it sometimes idk man

part of me wants to revive that zenkai photoshoot registration list again....

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

i thought you went ahead and posted it anyway?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

i didnt

but i should

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

what's to say anyone will check it anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

yeah it legitimizes the rwby shoot a little more at least tho

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

the fact that you made both wouldn't help. But as long as you don't try and organize them people, and let them organize themselves into the sheet, go for it.

Make sure you say it's unofficial though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

gosh look at me and my diplomacy, im so good

anyways yeah theres so many shoots i cant keep them straight, ill post it and say its an unofficial list

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

*are you diplomaizing me in this scenario?*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

wha no

"the size of it has dwindled" well duh

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

?

aaaah, I wasn't following the post.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

yeah

you cant have an hour long shoot with 8 people wha

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

Sounds like they just want to be in the RWBY shoot while running theirs.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

reschedule ya damn shoot person

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

well, if you look at the first post in the event... They might predate RWBY.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

black butlers dead tho

idk man i dont control the whims of the public

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

It is, just don't want to claim we had the idea first.

Maybe Vincent can chase them off with his minigun.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

lmao true

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

Best claim spots early... though you weren't taking on Next or colossal right?

~~oh right ANYC~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

colossal id do saturday

prob just saturday tho

anext idk yet

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

There was only a Saturday last year too. Too much water park to be doing shoots all day.

(Though there's a waterfall nearby apparently which we should really check out. I didn't last year.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

ok im totes posting the unofficial list

_pray for me_

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

I liked it.

I helped.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

thank

at least no one can say i didnt try

**Bill** - *2018-04-09*

"There's no such thing as a mistake, only not trying something."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

Daw thanks bill who said that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-09*

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

speaking of sakura sunday travel...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

ye whats the plan for sakura sunday

i gotta be back on campus by 10 on sunday

also i have 0 plans for zenkai friday, whats the photo plans kids

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Sakura sunday makes the most sense like this I think:
To Kinda:
``` 
Georgia
Me, Tom and Jess
```
To Tom & Jess's:
```
Georgia
Hal
Me, Tom and Jess
```
To Sakura Sunday:
```
Hal, Georgia
Me, Tom and Jess
```
Back from Sakura Sunday:
```
Me, Tom, Jess, Georgia
```
And you leave from them Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet i dig it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

~~With the time zone that's exactly what we'll be doing~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

*MM noises going off*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

OH i thought you meant in person XD

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Oh, ooooh. MM as in mystic messenger.

Yeah, that one's phrased pretty weird there.

Marisa wouldn't room with us at Zenkai though, she'll be with the staffers.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

yeaaah probably shouldve capitalized that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

weather in person, or virtually you can hang out with us

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

yeah staff gets free room sorry fam üò≠ but I could try and get you like some kitkats or potato chips from the staff room next year. so fancy.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-10*

Yes omg you should have capitalize d

I read it 4 times

Like Holy fuck Georgia

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

"mmmmmmmmm noises"

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-10*

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

More like one of the synonyms of humming.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

~~MM noises are mmmm noises~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Knight Light
Electromagnetism
& Actually Married.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

woooOOOOOOOO

i like how the ship names for fictional characters have become ways to refer to us in pairs

well except actually married

thats the Real Deal‚Ñ¢

With Stinky‚Ñ¢ that means we'll also have:

Cherry Blossom Boudoir

and also whatever hal and i and hal and jess are, those dont have clever names yet

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

I thought you guys liked wezmelt.

Hal and Jess don't have anything, iirc.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

I like wezmelt but is that universally accepted

i gotta keep these ship names straight g-damn

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

*Whose opinion matters more than yours?*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Two things for Sakura sunday. We should probably try to get on the road earlyish, given it's a 2 hour trip. Parking gets crazy. 

Second getting food is a pain, cause it's a bunch of a food trucks and it's packed. I was talking to Flora and Steve about that and maybe want to bring a picnic lunch peeps?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

tom and marisa are like: Dat üëè Good üëè Dark üëè Fantasy or something likethat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

im washing dishes but i just thought of a name for beorgia did you guys come up with one yet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

BORGIA

that was a famous dude in history

Cesare Borgia

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

omg really

what about A Model Relationship
because he's a photographer and u a model

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

He was the son of the pope who inherited a lot of money then blew it and got assassined

marisa is too good gdamn

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

unless u guys get a ton of money and then get assassinated then we change it to beorgia

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

imma get assassined



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

_anonymous kraken who are you_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

ME üòÑ

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

that's incorrect. It's 
"Where every person on Earth grows a single wing and the couples join hands and fly upward into the heaven together while the rest of the world spins around in circles like a boat with only one oar for the rest of eternity."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

~~biru and hal can both be intellectual and fancy at times so what about sophistigaytion~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

Hal isnt a fancy boi

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-10*

u right

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

~~They can't be in the closet if they're boyfriends~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Can you tell your manager you need to put money down in advance for this?

*these

It might help.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

Nah it won't 
He's setting final rto for the summer by the end of the week anyways (Sunday night)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

üò≠üò≠üò≠

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

If I bother him about he'll just tell me I can't have it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

Yea I understand

Still that sucks it's still awhile till summer üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Maybe you can strike a deal with a coworker to take you shift if you have one.

Rtx is a week right?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

I'm going to try but like

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Maybe that's why.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

Can't do it till week off

And nah it's cause I'm on the bottom of the totem pole and people get to dibs dates from me

Even if we don't work the same position

Or if I was trying to rto for it months before them

I tried to rto for zenkai in feb

One of the guys who got it asked for it after I did, during the period that we were told we can't rto cause we were gonna have a meeting to set the rto for the summer

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

Ughhh üò≠ that sucks so bad

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

~~maybe gonna start another job hunt for better hours

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-13*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

i need a location not a lenny lol :p

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Tom's been taking Marisa lessons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

What time you coming?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

late

earliest I get off is 4, latest 5. 
then I drive into princeton to drop something off

then I drive to yall

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

So like, 9 give or take an hour.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

ya probably

I'll bring the mac and cheese if need be

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

we don't want to stay up too late... It's a two hour drive to phili and getting there late will make parking hell.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

ya figured 
I just tend to have mac and cheese in the car

~~doesn't have the willpower not to buy 10 for 10 mac and cheese deals~~

_its like 5 dollars of savings_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

Our address is 101 Signal Hill trail Sparta NJ 07871

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

it means I could by 5 more if I wanted

estimated drive time for both stops i need is 3 hours

huh

so I'd actually probably arrive by 8
unless i'm super unlucky

-knocks on wood-

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

What time does Kindacon end?

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

11pm?

They have a rave.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

are yall planning on the full kindacon?

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

*I can't rave without booze tho*

There is no plan for it yet. I kinda figure we'll leave for around dinner time like Kogara?

~~Go eat chilis and send you lots of photos~~

~~Bring back chilis for you to eat~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

ew cold knock off applebees üòù

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

There's little plan.

It's a 2:10 drive to Sakura Sunday, so if we were *smart* we'd leave like 8.

that'd also be pretty miserable.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

Are we all smooshing in one car for that?

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

no.

Me, you, Tom & Hal, Georgia.

Georgia will come back with us.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

Mmk

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

(You could go down with us too if you wanted, but I *figure* you have a preference for Hal-lem.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-13*

Ya I 100% need to drive separate cause I gots to go home direct due to work the next day

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

Yup. It'd be pointless for you to come all the way up again too.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-13*

UNDERSTANDABLE <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

Wait did noone give you the address still?

**Bill** - *2018-04-13*

He got it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-13*

Are you saying you don't just put Vault 101 in the GPS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-13*

That'd be sweet

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

So I know we're thinking about the heat wave of tomorrow, but it's going to be muggy and 50 degrees sunday. Keep that in mind, bring jacket or sweatshirt, etc.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

I'm gonna die both days

Tomorrow I'ma sweat and Sunday I'll freeze

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

Haha thanks üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

<@184437198865563648>  what time you pick us up? So I know what time I need to be seven-ified by

Sure!

It's right in my closet so it's not hard to get out

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

10:30? I'm going early to get the tire replaced so hopefully that's not a problem getting to you. I'll keep in touch on that one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

Okey dokey. Worse come to worse me and Tom can always go on our own

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

* You'll have to come get me.

LIke, I apparently can't highway with this, it could pop the tire if it gets too hot.

Not sure.

I have a spare though, so if we're pushing time I'll be like 'k thx bye, I'll do this later and use that'

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-14*

Well whatever we gotta do

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-14*

deuce's pre-con amv judging party thing is today in the US. doki doki. tomorrow he'll post the results of who got into the next round for at-con judging online.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

Internal screaming

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

You'll be fine.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-14*

15 minutes, joker-rat has not broken character once

Only 2 others have reference photos it looks like?

**Bill** - *2018-04-14*

That's points in your favor.

Joker rat tho.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

Ok friend were heading home now

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-15*

I hope you guys have a shorter drive lol 
It'd be awkward for me to arrive first

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-15*

Nah we just got here

**Bill** - *2018-04-15*

<@!141729881779077121> We're not going to sakura Sunday. 20 degree winds, 44 degrees, and rain all day. It's just not going to be worth it. I don't know if you were debating it but I wanted to let you know.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

I misread Hal‚Äôs post as him being trapped at his uncles farm like a horror movie

**Andrew** - *2018-04-15*

<@184437198865563648> Yea I understand

I'm still on the fence myself

Ron and the guys aren't sure either

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

~~do i use my staff powers to peek at the current amv score ratings and rip off the proverbial bandage early or do I wait a week do see myself get rejected when they make the official announcements~~

i should be Patient‚Ñ¢
~~i gotta know~~ patient

**Bill** - *2018-04-15*

screw the rules.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

no rules, they're public google doc forms and they were posted in an event on the staff page. there's no rule saying we can't look at them. mainly we just can't leak them so I couldn't like screenshot them and post them elsewhere

omg if there was a rule I wouldn't even dream of doing it

**Bill** - *2018-04-15*

* screw common sense.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

~~should i look~~

the only reason it's so tempting is because i'm out of chocolate. i ate the only box i had earlier and then took a shower so I couldn't go out and buy more. I have kitkats but they're limited edition kinds and I already ate them before, the rest have to be saved as gifts.
there are 3 unopened bags and an unopened box but they're all alcoholic kitkats. why are there so many different kinds of alcoholic kit kats I haven't even gotten like half of them.
also no one cards me when I buy them even though they're *clearly* labelled as bad come on peeps. a random japanese guy will tell people i'm his 16 year old granddaughter but i don't get carded buying candy? ridiculous.

SOMEONE POSTED A REVIEW OF ONE OF MY BOWS i'm happy now i am content and no longer possessed by sin

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-15*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

It was one of the cheap experimental Halloween bowties from a blind bag (I put all my flawed ones in discounted themed blind bags) but they said this was their favorite. Heart emoji

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-15*

DAVE
YOU'VE NEVER POSTED A SELFIE HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW YOU HAD A CORPOREAL FORM

idk how much he posts in the day but to me he's like this spirit that pops in occasionally to say something super witty and post dank memes then disappears into the nether like a phantom. someone i've never met can't exist.
i'm blaming dave for my own shortcomings don't take it personally bro i'll draw you as a magical girl this week to apologize

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-15*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

*don't do drugs*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

You gotta pay to crawl around in a gilly suit? üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

Oooo yea that would make sense lol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

Oooo I never been to a rocky show üò∂

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

LMAO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

we sat down and they gave us bags of bread and toilet paper and confetti and stuff and I was so confused and scared they had to give me a print-out of explicit instructions of when to throw stuff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

Yup I have that lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

Adorable

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

someone used to cosplay betty at otakon at it was a REALLY good cosplay

now that I think about it they were probably a Rocky Horror performer oops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

Opps

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

u know whats a good musical

little shop of horrors

I know all the words and songs from a bunch of musicals but i've never actually seen them because I sat backstage <:lenny:395307171539189760>
Seussical the Musical is fun because the stage hands don't need to be in all black and ninja-y, they actually wear Thing costumes and get to be noticable on stage. at least the way we did it. that was nice.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

I've seen bits and pieces of little shop of horrors but I've never actually seen it üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

~~my next cosplay~~



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

Do it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

i've made the puppets for Audrey II before but it was the tiny versions, others worked on the big version that someone actually wore.
omg a bigger one could be carted around a con in a wagon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

üòÆüòÆüòÆ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-16*

Seymour is shit at naming

Like its a great musical but for real

You're telling me nobody saw him name his plant Audrey 2

And went "bro really? You're that desperate/bad with names?"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

audrey be like "wow so amazing, where did you get the inspiration for this name?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-16*

Poor Audrey 
Either she has abusive rich dentist with a laughing gas addiction

Or a poor creepy boi with man eating plant that "just happens" to always be by her side

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

plot twist: Audrey II pays homage to its namesake and makes Audrey queen dictator of Earth

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-16*

After eating her lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

Wow the two girls next to me walked out halfway through

Guess they didn't like it

But otherwise there were a lot of peeps there

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

I can see why people would be culture shocked by it

It is a bit if an anomoly

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-16*

~~its also not really that good anyways~~

~~extremely overhyped~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

Never been to one myself, but I had read up about them

Probably not my cup of tea

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

There's also rice in my Everywhere

I truly have become wise rice

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

Omg!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

Yeah I go because justin

And this one is at Rutgers

And not _starting at midnight_

I don't really understand the fascination with just ONE movie but eh???

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

Yeah it's just a cultural phenomenon

Kinda nuts that it exists at all

With all the specific things ya gotta do

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

it flopped really badly when it first came out, but some theaters in california noticed that the same people would come and watch the show again and again every night. they started coming up with all the little shouts and participation methods. when it stopped airing, other theaters began to pick it up for niche groups. it began as improv but then turned into a routine that discouraged improv, and people started showing up for the audience participation and see the unique crowd reactions. it was like a literal cult.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

IM SCREAMING I HAVE A STORY FOR YALL IN 10 mONITES

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

***suspense***

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

SOMEONE RECOGNIZED ME AS WEZREZ IM SCREAMING

that's the story

Anyways elaboration now that I'm waiting for a bus

There was a girl with a 707 jacket and blue hair waiting and she comes up and she's like "are you Wezrez... Georgia?" And I'm like /silent screaming

Apparently some girl met Justin at Katsu and she must really like him cause she drove 6 hours from Pittsburgh to see him in rocky

So she may be stalking him because she knew he and I were bros

And all she talked about was how long I knew justin and that her friends were trying to hook her up with him and she recently left her boyfriend

So I GOTTA GRILL JUSTIN FOR DEATS LATER

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

THERE'S BEEN A PUBLIC WEZREZ SIGHTING

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

Yeah so highkey she may be stalking justin

Though when I asked him he just said he "felt bad because probably nothing will come of it"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

he might be mega troubled from it if she drove like 6 hours to see him

watch out boi

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

Well she's going home tonight no matter what

But it sounded like she was coming onto him and he's not having it but she doesn't know that?

And all the things she asked me right off the bat seemed to be the kind of things to make sure I wasn't competition or something

I was like LOL Justin's almost 5 years older than me and he's still like a little brother

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

that's crazy oh no
have they ever met before or was this their first time meeting irl?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

Nah I think she came to his last show

_how you got time to drive so much_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-16*

das 12 hours of driving in a day girl

she should get a virtual boyfriend instead i hear cheritz has a good app for that

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

Wow. Justin has a list ‚Ñ¢.

In reality(?):
She wore a 707 jacket
Justin cosplays 707
Justin likely did so at Katsu
She saw Justin as 707 and said ‚Äòmy 2d husbando is here‚Äô
Is now stalking the guy who looks like 707 cause virtual boyfriend

Takeaway:
Jess will soon have high key stalker girls asking Tom about her because she cosplays Seven.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

but we need a jaune üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

Sure, though are you doing more than just that shoot for Pyrrha?

I figured you were solo Pyrrha'd out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

did we schedule a solo shoot yet?

i dont have anything on my doc

if we schedule after the rwby shoot we can try to grab a jaune straight from it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

jaune auditions, fight to the death whoever wins can be our jaune

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

we didn't for Pyrrha. You weren't that hype or something along those lines.

Nor NPR.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

well shoots at 3 yea? then we can do NPR right after?den fuds meybe

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

I can usually spend a max of 8 hours in pyrrha without fatigue so i may do a simple cosplay in the morn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

/me, eternally motivated: just take it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-16*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-16*

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

This works.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

yeah and i dont really want THAT many solo pics

but if i get cool ideas for a particular solo shot of pyrrha ill let ya know

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

I know you don't, don't worry.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-16*

a lot of people, based on my giveaway, like the dynamic pyrrha photos too, like the fighting poses and the dead shield one

**Bill** - *2018-04-16*

i dont think we ever had a consensus, how did everyone feel about kindacon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-17*

it tiny, but it was kinda nice cuz i actually got to talk to people? which is hard at big cons, id prob go again since its close to home

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-17*

I'll go again cuz it's close

Kindacon is expensive for what it‚Äôs got but is local so it‚Äôs a easy excuse to cosplay. It‚Äôs a hangout con.

<@!184437198865563648>  would it be possible for us to do a solo shoot for Nora at zenkai?

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

yes, and it was going to happen anyway. üëå I always have plans to do solo photos when doing group shoots, we just never get to them. Especially at Katsu given Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-18*

ok thanks! i just relized i have no pictures as her without tom

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

If anyone's interested, I'll let you know when I'm going to the archery range in bloomfield.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-18*

Done, I'm sold

I'll bring my Pyrrha

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

*actually serious please*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-18*

I'd be interested I just dunno where in my schedule such an excursion could fit

**Bill** - *2018-04-18*

it's every sunday.

I'm not going just once either, so if you happen to be around on a sunday it'll work out.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-18*

If you wanted to do it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

what shoe size are u you could borrow my Neon skates because i am on other side of planet

wig too but I can't remember if I started remaking that or not

beware tho I almost got kicked out of Otakon *even though skates weren't mentioned in the rules* it said nothing about shoes aside from you couldn't be barefoot. nyeh.

i wanna cosplay something else friday morning of zenkai so that i wont get exhausted wearing pyrrha later in the day

but idk what .-.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

breakdance ladybug? max? something comfy

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

probably need something that works with Pyrrha makeup too...

Be good if you had Pyrrha's uniform. Then 3 Pyrrha's in one day.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

oH YEAH good idea i wonder how much a uniform is

shout out to bill for taking the make up into account, bless you billiam

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

I try.

you'd have to buy or make it though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

Unless you have another character that wears bright green eyeshadow, you'll prob have to add that later

uynless you do another version of pyrrha that is

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

the biggest thing is the contacts, so green eyes

i could probably make the uniform from just buying amazon clothes and modifying them

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

true true.

Just don't want to cut too much into Weiss updates, Pyrrha leg armor, and FATMAN.

because also finals.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

well that all sounds stressful as shit

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Exactly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

i finished my math midterm, i can do anything <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Woah there.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

yeah theres no good school uniform skirts on amazon

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-19*

Ebayyyy

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

that seems... strange.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

the school uniforms are black and gold and red

its a strange combo

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

griffindor colors.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

Me: "Im not gonna be here may forth"
Coworker: "which con are you going too?"
Me: "Zenkaicon"
Coworker: "what? hentaicon?"
Me: "I hate you"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Aliexpress has it for under $50, one seller has it for $25 but idk if it‚Äôd come in time

O wait the $25 is just the coat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

its just the skirt thats the issue

i can modify a jacket and sew the underneath corset vest thing

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Was going to say, corset != comfy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

maybe i could wear star ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Where do all the anime girls get their tartan skirts?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Biru you have not worn a corset

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

no shit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Omg I saw so many tartan skirts today there‚Äôs a ton in Donki

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

corset? just looks like a tight blazer to me

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Check donkis international site

Ya it doesn‚Äôt look like a corset

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

its a little brown thing underneath the jacket but over the shirt

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

http://www.beaconschool.co.uk/2327/information/uniform <- this is not rwby.



You can see it there.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Just a vest. Like a sweater vest but not sweatery

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

yea i think you could get around that easily

like a thick belt thing or something

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

If you don‚Äôt care about accuracy you could just sew a panel for the front and not make the whole vest

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

yeah thats no problemo

i could try to finish up marinette?

i have the pants and the blazer

id just need to order the shirt

and then sew a pink lining in

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

oh, that one Marisa was looking at is 20% off.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

Yehaw but high shipping

Also alie comes from China so might be a close call

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

aaah.

RIP.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-19*

I‚Äôve had stuff arrive like 2 days later and sometimes like 5 months later (cough yoon wig cough)

Triple Pyrrha is neat, but not worth any kind of stress. Just buy it sometime and you'll have it for whenever.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

i cant believe i have such a chill friday of zenkai

thats so lit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-19*

Wowwee a not stressful day, *what a steal*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

*what a steal*

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

it's just NPR and the group shoot right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

Yeeee

I'll prob wear Star or Max in the morning

Dunno which

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

I dunno enough about star, but maybe use the locations to decide.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-19*

Star is cutesy and fun like sailor moon sorta

It's more like I haven't worn Star in 5ever and I love her cosplay so

Also I just got that new wig that's for Star now

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

sounds like a done deal.

I got a like storm.

That‚Äôs cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

<@184437198865563648>  I thought this katsu was your first?

**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

It is?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*



**Bill** - *2018-04-19*

Why wouldn't it be?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-19*

Why jnpr labeled katsu?

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

HA whoops.

I ran into an issue with that album before, it merged Katsu and Ota JNPR because the same name.

I guess I named them both Katsu now.

I'll fix it when I get to the train later.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-20*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

i love how people allready have line up for cons months from now and i just figured mine out for zenkai like 2 days ago RIP

wait zenkai can a 21+ group? im surprised marisa hasnt arrested them all yet

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

You'd would have "had to" run the shoot. The person in the first place was saying they'd do it if no one else will.

most cons have those.

I've never bothered.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-20*

henwo
the staff panel is essentially 21+ because everyone is drunk and drinking at it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

i feel like i ahve more to do then that but i cant think

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

any repairs?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

nora's belt, ooo i have to look at lilith too she prob need some fixes

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Didn't you have something with Nora's jacket? a sleeve?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

eh? i wanted to add the buckles on her sleeves but meh

im gonna focus on magnild first

which reminds me. what the car situation for zenkai?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

OH that reminds me

that one photographer (i forget the name, the one that ranted on FB) asked if id be able to shoot thursday night

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

LTD iirc.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

~~because i didnt wanna pay for a shoot during the weekend oops but i think he just wants to try shooting me so idk thursday?~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

it's up to you?

You don't have any cosplays planned thursday night, as far as I know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

well that leads me to next question, i think ill haul ass to carpool with yall as long as we have room in the car

when would we get there thurs?

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

When can everyone can get my house?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

i have a final that morning but thats it

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Jess/Tom? 6pm?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

thats fine

~~as long as magnihld can fit~~

have to take to my dad about breakdown options

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

prop city woohoo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

well what props are you bringing?

~~gotta make a packing list~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

Pyrrhas shield+sword, Weiss' sword, ~~way too much armor~~, Hopefully Thirst Zapper and Fat Man

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

theres no way all our stuff is gonna fit with magnihld and fat man

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Unless that Fat Man breaks down I get the feeling it's never getting to a con.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

magneeeeets

ill make it break down ~~assuming i get to it~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

does your truck have a bed cover?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

aye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

üëÄ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

not a hutch thing

but a tarp cover that straps down

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

i mean like even a soft top

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

ye soft top

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

Which is the point for both of these; neither are started. I agree that'll be nice with both weapons, lets cross that bridge when we come to it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

do it keep rain out?

magnihld is started

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

when it rains, theres running boards that filter it out

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

neat

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

so if its SUPER fragile like a laptop i wouldnt keep it back there just to be safe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

well lets see where we are in 2 weeks

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

but props have always been fine, and suitcases have NEVER had an issue

ye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

~~not that i wanna pin driving on you, but you do have most cargo space~~

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

~~from what I've seen cosplay props should always be considered fragile~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

so you just pack everything so not alot moves around

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-20*

yeah its a trade off

my gas mileage is garbo so it usually means more gas money

but i have a lot more space for hauling stuff

**Bill** - *2018-04-20*

YOU CAN DO IT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

if its done we need to bring it

I think the black ribbon or cloth for the undershirt

Is all I'm missing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-20*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

*teleports you*

this is the part where i read the schedule, pic thing im interested in, and then never go

Marisa should I go to any panels?

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

The 21+ staff panel is pretty much the only goal I have. I didn‚Äôt look at it yet, dance is when?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

the ball is 8pm

thats friday

and then theres a rave (?) dance at 10:45 on saturday

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

Rave.

8pm is a bit early, can‚Äôt do any golden hour photos if people need to change for the dance.

Or on the flip side, can do dance outfit golden hour photos?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

I was supposed to be trying to learn to dance wasn‚Äôt I.

Rip.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

tom and i were minorly interested in that also\

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

I mean, there's a place in ledgewood but I never called about it.

Andrew knows how to dance.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-21*

Gasp

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

maybe I'll call the place tomorrow...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-21*

Hewwo I haven‚Äôt seen the schedule yet but I‚Äôll look it over and tell you if anything is mega good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-21*

GOLDEN HOUR FORMAL JNPR SIGN ME THE FUCK UP

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-21*

üëå

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

Late to the party are we not.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-21*

omg so many cosplay panels at zenkaikon. especially saturday morning omg.

greggo's game shows are usually fun though i hear he's a bit difficult to work with. i've been a participant a few times, usually runs games well.

guy who runs the cosplay dating game is good at his job, though contestants are usually unprepared for the 18+ dating one and it's not as risque as it's meant to be

guests against humanity is usually one of the most popular events the whole weekend. all filming is prohibited though and it's a "what happens in CaH stays in CaH" type of panel so we don't hear much about it

oooo staff uncensored got moved to 1am. maybe because most staff are still working at midnight

go to the charity auction! also i know "cosplay bullying" is anti-bullying but the panel name is funny. cosplay bullying.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

Thank you for your professional recommendation.  üëå

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-21*

they made the insane decision to have me help run the 18+ dating game last year. all the people running it were ace. the organizers were ace and lewder than the participants something went wrong.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

Omgggg üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-21*

But Zenkais formal you actually have to queue early for



Animenext don't call me out like this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-21*

Lmao that's what I thought

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

pfft.

Well this makes perfect sense. I turned on Star while starting the Kindacon photos.

Georgia is literally just Star.

It's not even cosplay.

damn.

... and there's a Tom.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-21*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

I'm legitimately concerned about ever giving you access to magic.

It's weird, it's like I'm watching a show about you and I don't know how I feel about that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-21*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

Is Hal Marco

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

Too agreeable.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-21*

Marco or Hal lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

Hal to be Marco lol.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-21*

Idk I could give Hal a cute little mole with my eyeliner :V

**Bill** - *2018-04-21*

I just mean personality, Hal could cosplay it in a heartbeat. üëç

oh hey Wash is in this show!

No wonder.

There are 3 seasons. Sweet.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-22*

Don‚Äôt people hate the newer seasons or did I imagine that because I didn‚Äôt finish getting up to date

**Bill** - *2018-04-22*

dunno.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-22*

[lots of Pidge cosplayers] why is pidge so popular
[watches voltron] I wanna cosplay pidge

THE DRIVER OF THIS TRAM SOUNDS LIKE THE GUY FROM PAPERS PLEASE

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-22*

Oooo wut dat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-22*

Omg it‚Äôs one of the best games 
You play as a guy working a border checkpoint and you have to make sure everyone‚Äôs papers are in order

It‚Äôs like having a job but in a game and sometimes you shoot people



THERES A VERSION FOR IPHONE gasp

**Bill** - *2018-04-23*

wooooah Next wants to do organized photoshoots.

https://www.facebook.com/groups/275459792629157/permalink/668924853282647/

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

all thanks to homestuck <:lenny:395307171539189760>
also good to see they're actually doing what they promised at closing ceremonies, because a bunch of people brought that up

**Bill** - *2018-04-23*

really? Georgia hates that system, and I wasn't impressed at Katsu either.

And I haven't id'd every location in my mental map, but alot of them aren't worth a damn to begin with.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

homestuck is the reason it exists in the first place <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
but yeah, at least 2 or 3 people actually asked the con chair directly and a bunch of people backed them up at closing ceremonies about official photoshoots because I think there were issues with multiple photoshoots meeting up at the same time/spot

**Bill** - *2018-04-23*

All the locations are on upper floors.

The best two locations are the stairs outside to train station and the area before the cafeteria.

I've never seen a shoot organized on the upper floors.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

i saw one there in passing but it was tiny

**Bill** - *2018-04-23*

there's not enough space for shoots up there.





They made a photoshoot location map.

All third and fourth floor, all backing shitty spots if you want the good light.

*They definitely didn't consult a photographer*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-04-23*

Someone in the Zenkaikon staff chat is asking for a ride up on Friday evening. Friend. You need to be there Thursday afternoon at the latest no matter what your job is.

**Bill** - *2018-04-23*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Still don't have a schedule for it

haven't switched jobs

so I can't say I'm going

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

right, I know that, but you're a crazy SOB. If you have one day free are you going to nyoom up for a day/night? Or will that be too much to do?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-27*

I should hopefully have next weeks schedule by the end of today

depends on what day, and what time I have work the day after

also you right

if I can, I want to be able to come up for at least 1 day/night yes

I just have no idea if I can

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

but you'll know tonight?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-27*

sometimes they don't send it out till saturday evening

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-27*

Yeahhhh 
But it's not good either 
It's frustrating teetering on the edge

**Bill** - *2018-04-27*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-27*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-28*

So if we have a rental I can take it

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

So for the time being I'll do the cost as you aren't going to be there thursday night.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

<@!184437198865563648> confirm for me when you get it

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

I got it, but you didn't need to do it immediately. Especially if Hal's plan changes...?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

eh then its a tip

id rather do it now than forget

plus i dont like having outstanding expenses; i like knowing exactly how much money i have

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

I can understand that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

i dont think im gonna do ghillie suit squad for zenkai friday night

i think im just gonna do very very low level commitments this con

ill likely just hang with them while theyre doing it a bit

prob get some video cause ill actually feel like vlogging this time

though speaking of, <@!184437198865563648> can we snap some star pics on friday morning?

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

Yeah, we're going to just enjoy Zenkai. Katsu was too business for you and I.

Course we can.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

do you wanna set aside a specific time or is whenever good lol

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

Only thing I have before the RWBY shoot is 11:00 to noon, Gen and Chris as Gelato.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

daw cute

you wanna say 10-11 then? (we wont actually take that whole hour block tho i dont think)

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

Sure. I doubt they'll be a full hour either.

Friday it's them, rwbyshoot, and whatever JNPR we want to do, including the Renora for Tom and Jess.

But since all of that is pretty much post RWBY shoot the day itself should be relaxed.

Goals to relax at Zenkai and see all the friendos. Just enjoy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-28*

yup yup!

**Bill** - *2018-04-28*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

what do i use with body paint anyway? paint brush?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

You can use those little triangle cotton thingies for big sections of body paint

And make up brushes for the smol yeah

I usually used my finger to smooth it all out in the end too

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

okey dokey ill bring a few different things then

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

Pretty Georgia has you covered, but I can like, hop over and give moral support.

Lord knows I'll be up.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

tom did it last time, but Ive never done body paint

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

Getting dinner at a restaurant and expecting to be back for formal within the hour is unrealistic tho

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

when is the formal?

dinner doesnt sound like a good idea D:

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

I'm not really considering it.

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

congrats on becoming my assistants for an hour.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

wut?

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

to Hal. If they need an out (which they can just refuse to begin with, no one will take it personally) they can be my assistants for your shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

OH YEA

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

Would you be cool with 10~11 time frame? Can do both of you in that I'd think.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

You got anything later? I realise beggers can't be choosers I just don't know how complicated body paint is gonna be

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

1 to 2?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

That works! I'm assuming Tom wants pic even if he didnt say so

Thank you!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

Ooooh smart excuse thanks

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

I do a shit job at relaxing. I ended up at 4 shoots friday and saturday.

üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

They're more casual tho

And they're with close friends, not people you sorta know

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

You can say no! I don't want to stress you out

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

No... Nepotism is my thing.

I couldn't tell anyway, I've got a residual stress going on from becoming lead dev on my project in two weeks. This could end up as a nightmare for me.

Georgia, 142 pulls from yesterday.

Doesn't mean all of them are winners, but that's what I'm going to edit through.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

WOOOOOOO

Have a fav yet?

<@!184437198865563648> when do we get to Zenkai on Thursday, and furthermore, when do I need to be in north jersey?

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

I picked them this morning, I was half asleep and now I'm kinda stressed.

weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssss

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-30*

I hope you realize we'll be in the room after the con trying to go to sleep... And someone will randomly go:

".......‚Ä¶....... We can do this!"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-04-30*

thanks...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-30*

its not as bad as

"my milkshake brings all the bees to my car.."

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-04-30*

Omfg

üôå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

STAY POSITIVE

**Bill** - *2018-04-30*

right.

Be at my place by 6.

That's what we're aiming for, unless <@!351785752197201920> and <@!351471675843411978> can get there earlier.

<@!245270932602486784> .

right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-04-30*

YEET

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Photographer problems: kinda want to not wear dress shirts all con.

My thought is sports coat and the three T-shirts I ever wear.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-01*

why u gotta wear dress coats

my katsu photographer was green with a fish bowl on her head. live your dreams.

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Rebecca has *just now* sent me a message about a shoot.

So you aren't the absolute latest Jess.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

Opp

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Considering I'm already over one both friday and saturday from the number I was aiming for...

I told her and Jaime no.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-01*

a lot of photogs who do free shoots use google forms and have people submit requests by a certain date and then announce their schedule afterwards, like a giveaway. when u get mega famous u may have to try that

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Problem with that, I don't want to be famous.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-01*

start wearing a disguise every convention

not a cosplay but like. a different fake moustache or something.

every con

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

I'm not going to get famous anyway, so I don't need to do that.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-01*

fame is accidental

if u don't u gonna get fame

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

I lack the bewbies for fame.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-01*

YO THERE WERE SO MANY GOOD CROSSPLAYERS AT CHOUKAIGI
I was watching the cosplay stage area for a while and at least 1/3 of the contestants who were adorable girls were guys. they'd open their mouth to talk and you'd just hear this gasp as everyone was like "a guy??"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

Some peeps just got dat skillüëå

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-01*

this one guy had a really convincing chest (he was cosplaying Saber) and there were 2 interviewers, a guy and a girl. the girl was like "can I touch your chest" and he was like "sure" so she started poking it. The guy interviewer was like, "woah, really?" and went to poke it but the cosplayer went "kyaa" and turned away from him.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

That's amazing üëå üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

<@!351785752197201920> <@!184437198865563648>  and <@!245270932602486784>  we are meeting at billy's at 6:00 on thursday ya?

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

yeah, unless you two can get there earlier.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

maybe a lil earlier?

like 10 mins or so

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

then we'll still call that 6.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

i get out at 5, then 10 mins to get home then pack car then 20 mins to you so yea 6 is probably the earliest

if all our stuff doesnt fit should we split into two cars? or maybe take <@!245270932602486784> 's truck?

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

we'll have to do something.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

~~if we take the truck tom and i can sit together in the back since he doesnt get carsick in trucks~~

which doesnt actually matter, its just something i thought of

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*

O wow tom gets carsick?

But not in trucks?

That's interesting

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

yea cuz in a truck your not in the back of the vehicle you're in the middle!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*

HUH I still don't get how that works but sure!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

idk if your open to taking your truck though üòÆ

i think its cuz you dont get whipped around as much as the back seat of a car

will give gas monies

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

We'll figure it out.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

Yeah cuz you are in the front half of the vehicle

The forces are different then the back half

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

ZENKAI HAS A DRAGON AGE PANEL WUUUUTTT

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

OOOOOOooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

thats surprising seeing as the last game came out like 3 yrs ago

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Maybe I should look at the panels.

why are... SO many of them LGBTQ panels?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

hmm didnt notice

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

Supply and demand

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Tom wins.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

?

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

His reason.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

lmao i didnt give a reason

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Also, there's a cosplay boudoir panel. I wonder if it's the same panelist.

I might go check that out again, last time it was neat. Are you and Tom going to do the burlesque Jess?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

dunno havent talked about it

probably depends on anyone else is going

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

Yeah pm

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Everyone else going would be my only interest.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*

i SAW SO MANY LGBT PANELS TOO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

~~is anyone bringing a bathing suit?!~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*

too many imho

nah lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Save it for memorial day.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

there is no limit on swimming my friend

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

and yeah, I don't understand why there needs to be half a dozen on friday alone.

As usual, only panels that sound amusing are 18+ these days. So evening events.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

well as tom said supply and demand.

there were some cosplay panels i might check out?

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

the 1am staff panel Marisa's been talking about, Boudoir shoot panel, I know Fate cosplayers who are going to show up drunk to the Fate one... Then the dances.

Mmm, that's a cool idea.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

i find is amusing that the building weapon out of foam panel is friday while i will have foam weapon, body paint 101 is saturday while ill be in body paint and sunday is crossplaying while ill be crossplaying like what coincidence

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

Are you actually the panelist?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

YEA

"hello i have one each of these one time, pls learn from me"

**Bill** - *2018-05-01*

You assume panelists have to know what they're talking about.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

so you going or what? XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

OMG

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-01*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-01*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-01*

~~I crave a good cider~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

homestuck photoshoot OwO
Corgi cosplay is one of our guest judges this year! She's got an award shaped like a corgi and she's known for cosplaying with her dog.



**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

Is she bringing the dog?!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

üëåüëåüëåüëå

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

is there service in this con center?

so i dont lose you again <w<

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

; A ;
it's usually better than katsu's, though I'm not too sure. I don't recall having a problem with phone service because we constantly used staff chats

the masquerade judges were using facebook messenger to communicate with cosplay staff last year and there was one skit they were clueless what was happening, it was a pretty good skit they just had no idea it was based on Mystery Skulls the animation and were very lost because they didn't know the source material so we provided them with context

protip if you do a masquerade skit, make it easy to understand for people who don't know the source material :3c

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-02*

will keep that in mind :3

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-02*

You doing a masquerade cam?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-02*

We‚Äôre supposed to have water stations but they‚Äôre usually dried up in like 2 hours oops. There are usually fountains by the bathrooms.

**Bill** - *2018-05-04*

Water stations I see, it is pretty earlier so that might be why they have water.

<@!301927856240459777> Zenkai staff had to disband the RWBY shoot because apparently the art gallery behind the fountain threatened to call the police

Because the RWBY shoot was "obstructing business"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-05*

Lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-05*

Wat
What art gallery. How big was the shoot? Was rwby just the unlucky final straw because of shoots happening all day
Most businesses in Lancaster love Zenkaikon because we‚Äôre literally the biggest money bringer to the city. Residents were shocked after the first year how much revenue we brought in

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-05*

I'm driving home and it's like a minicaravan of DE license plates cause only Delawares's or people going to Delaware would ever use this route

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-05*

The only time I recall a shoot being moved was when homestuck had their shoot in front of the fire doors in the dealers hall
And I was like y‚Äôall gotta move and they were like ‚ÄúUGH staff hates homestuck‚Äù and I was like. I‚Äôm staff in a homestuck cosplay what are you talking about.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-06*

You contact them telepathically as they‚Äôre driving and say ‚Äúhey it‚Äôs me, Hal. turn right at the next exit and you can avoid the toll booth‚Äù

BAY MAX IS AT THE RAVE AGAIN <@228287793099440128>

And solaire

And rave Lord nito but I missed him

**Dave** - *2018-05-06*

damn, must have been a nice one

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-06*

They played the DK RAP

Best rave

**Bill** - *2018-05-06*

Rave was more lit than I thought it would be.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-06*

I request toms ‚ÄúBaymax is at the rave‚Äù post be pinned for all time

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-06*

IT TRUE THO

Baymax was at collosal too and he was ***jiggly***

**Dave** - *2018-05-06*

does she know of the colossal clip?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-06*

The ***vibrating Baymax***

He was much more animated at this one

**Dave** - *2018-05-06*

nani

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-06*

More actual dancing

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

!counter drankaloos add 1

The drankaloos count is now 10!

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

But me and Jess definitely dropped this puppy down.

!counter drankaloos remove 3

!counter drankaloos sub 3

The drankaloos count is now 7!

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

!counter drankaloos sub 4

The drankaloos count is now 3!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

question

does it drop whenever one of us takes a shot or what

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

In theory it's supposed to be a specific shot for the drankaloos.

Gotta dedicate the shot to Mangaloo's ego.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Nooooo

No shots

Dat bad

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

oh hi marisa

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Idc if it's actually done as a shot though. It can be a drink in dedicated too.

Cause I haven't done a shot in years.

But between everyone Jess drank and my finishing a bottle in two days, I think we earned out reduction.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

I had 6 drinks and like the equivalent of maybe 4 shots

**Dave** - *2018-05-07*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-07*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

YEE

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Oh ye, Matt wasn't the only one who surprised to see me not being the photographer. Peter thought I'd be shooting Gen and Chris's snowbirds.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Did they do snowbirds?

Oh yea shit NVM

Lmao someone posted a pic of me and Tom and Rebecca tagged us in it so we'd see it. But the person captioned it "Rin and Nora from Ruby" so then someone was like "RWBY**"

Like look if your gonna correct someone at least do it fully

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Lmao yeah I saw that

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

@everyone Katsu early bird is next Monday and regular booking the week after. We need a role call for whose interested so I know what to book.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Standard rooms are 210 a night, Atrium view are 245.

I'll do a pricing chart thing... later, sometime, like I usually do. Mostly mentioning to get it into people's heads.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

any idea what the cancellation fee is?

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Nope.

Unless it's a full night stay I'll consider eating it on a second room.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

<@!351785752197201920>  what your opinion on da katsu

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

I mean I liked it alot the only thing that sucked was the crowds

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

~~it distracted me from my seasonal affective disorder for while üëå ~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Yeah true

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

and then if zenkai is in march maybe itll be non existent whooooo

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

If I'm doing Katsu again, it's casually, no shoots after like 11am and I'm going to chat and enjoy everyone being in the same place, alot like Zenkai.

I think Georgia is of the same mind.

Mag fest is a thing, but same thing as connecticon applies, missing alot of friends isn't fun.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yeahhhh

i still will want shoots, no doubt

maybe ill do like one solo, one group, and then the general group shoot per day

that sounds like a healthy balance, and gives enough content for insta, and also showcases the cosplay work AND means ill be doing group shoots (like JNPR or Schnee) with friends

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Yeah, I like the group shoots because they're still very social for us.

And 3 is the magic number, I agree. I didn't count the General but maybe I should have.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

i wanna do something really cool for katsu but i am intimidated

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

~~POWER ARMOR TIME YEEHAW~~ lol jk

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

ive wanted to do Drizzt for a long time but everyones gonna think im Lotor whoops

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

nah they skins and clothes different

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

true, idk how id go about making that tho XD

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

I liked doing the burst of shoots too.

Like going from group, then JNPR, then Renora, even if it didn't work like that.

Leaves plenty of time for lolligagging.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yeeeee

im hearing rumors that zenkai had 800 less people than they did last year?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Hmmmm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

im chalking it up to it being finals week

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Definitely a bad time for it, but it's good.

full deposit returned if you cancel a room early enough in the gaylord.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

comments on facebook

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

and i was like damn jess psychic

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

well anime boston moved weekends so

anime boston doesnt clash with it now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

i wonder what made them decide that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

kindacon gets knocked out of next year i think then

CPAC might be moving into May

theyve always been competing with zenkaikon for dates

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

ye

<@!351785752197201920>  are we registered for CCE?

colossaleast

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

oh wow its 40 bucks advance purchase for Colossal now

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

YEET

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Zenkaicon finally realized they had they're best numbers when it happened in late march instead of Late April/may

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

more ways for me to combat my winter depression WHOO

soooo no magfest ye?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

not lookin like it

maybe if i had extra money and i really wanted to try it, and no one else is really interested, id ask ginnyliz if her room had space

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

ok im taking it off my list then

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

the only thing pushing me to go is curiosity tbh

thats like it

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Well if we do more vid game cosplay along with league

It'd be p worthwhile

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

that 3 month of big cons in a row though

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

...yeet?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

jan: magfest
feb: katsu
march: zenkai

BRUH

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Lol

You right 
#yolo

Not yeet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

bill and i were interested in anime boston last i remember too

which is april LMAO

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

ye I kinda wanna try AB too

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

When was kinda next year?

I'd look at mag if not for the time off required. Not a cost issue, it's the days from work.

Also we have big cons all summer too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

not me, ill be in maryland for 10 weeks in the summer hopefully!

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

*St Pattys is a weekend again*

I meant this year, but true.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

oh ye

but yeah thats why id be game to do more early-year cons next year

depending on how 10 weeks falls, anext and otakon could be shot for me

not colossal east tho thats still safe

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

You *could* come up, especially if it's not a 40 hour internship.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

im pretty sure its full time üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

but that's a future problem. Zenkai is in a much better spot next year.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

ye

- Students must be available full time (40 hours per week) for at least 10-weeks in the summer.
- Summer internships begin in May and June, on the first business day of each week.

ok so otakon should be ok

just anext is dead

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

That's... actually pretty acceptable.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

i suppose we could trade magfest for katsu ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/10/15/con-shortlist.html Important part of Mag/Katsu is they both two days off of work cons, with the travel required. Added to the circuit list the "Tier" which is how many weekdays you'll lose to it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

oh thas helpful

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Tier 2 cons are rough.

Well worth, but rough.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

hehe you put raynas last name on justin

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

(Tiers are based from my area, sorry Hallem)

There was something screwy with parking on the bill this weekend. I'll call and see if I can sort it out.

Actually nevermind, it's the correct pricing.

Course I didn't have parking in the original split so...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

So how much do I owe you

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Doing it by car makes the most sense, yeah. I'll send it to the con group chat, since Aaron isn't here.

How goes poll Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

12 people are going

4 of which i actually care about

david, one friend from on insta, and two friends from katsu

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Well, We'll see David pretty soon because of his birthday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

true

btw he said its not a sleepover explicitly, but they have a guest room if anyone would like to use it

and that the end time is flexible, people can leave whenever

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

I dunno if I'd plan to sleepover. New place and all that.

that's me personally.

He lives close to Sean and Matthew, it's drivable all in one day since my family does that visiting them.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

I figure if I go imma stay where the bae is at

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Makes the most sense.

DE to Long Island would suck.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

2 hours almost exactly from my house

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

about the same, as from us I'd guess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*



It's me, red and pink color palette weekend

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Yo that was me this weekend

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

I was actually listing your hair colors off to my parents when I got back last night.

They thought you dyed your hair for one of the cosplays and I was like nah, they had these colors.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

orange red, bright red, dark red wow such variety

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

I didn't say it was a variety.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

i wasnt saying you were XD

does this mean we are leaguing on friday and JNPRing on saturday orrrr?? cuz im not sure if everyone gon' be there friday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

im flexible

i can switch stuff around as needed

pyrrha is the only one i want firmly for saturday morning but friday, saturday afternoon, and sunday can be moved around

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

Ashley said she really wants to do Janna on saturday, so will see i suppose

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

since I'll probably have a similar schedule for ANEXT

I can only do friday/saturday cosplay most likely

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yona friday, pyrrha/lux saturday, yurippe sunday bae?

you think that works best?

cause then you can do hak, jaune/ezreal, and then go home sunday

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

bae I'll be leaving saturday evening probs

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

well yeah i mean that

i guess splitting the day doesnt really go for you then

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

So I was thinking on the way home Georgia, I don't think I'll feel bad passing on Connecticon. Rather than just us go for the weekend (Nothing personal, you know I like you) I'd say stick around Jersey and throw a par-tay or something.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yeah the poll isnt giving me great results at this point

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-07*

Jersey party on a Friday night I'd probably have a good chance of going

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yeah its just the jesses, david, sakura, and two other katsu friends going

which ill probably see most of those people at davids grad if i REALLY wanted to

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

Yeah. AB is in a better time frame, and more people go.

(side note, if we need a Ruby pre Marisa's return, Jessies live in Jersey. Forgot about that.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

i thought they lived in NY

huh

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

I might be wrong.

Either way, they close enough.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-07*

yeeee

alright so officially nix connecticon

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

deal.

Now to decide if I want to cave and Ota.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-07*

I wanna see Marisa but I don't wanna ota üò±

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Jesse's are in NYC Sakura's moving in with them soon

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

They don't live in the city city, do they?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

As in Manhattan?

**Bill** - *2018-05-07*

ye.

I know of both of their facebooks, both say they in mass actually.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-07*

Idk all it says is "I'm moving in with Jesse's in NYC on may 20th"

They moved like 2 months ago

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

eeeeeeeehhhhhhh

I mean, it's pretty obvious they aren't facebook people, but.

That'd be *shocking*.

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/10/15/con-shortlist.html

Updated with Katsu pricing.

Called and got what should be the accurate taxes.

Also <@!141729881779077121> and Georgia hit me up with them selfies.

*Zenkai has a theme?*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-08*

yes.
yes.

they mention it quite often.

this year was youkai and japanese ghosts. last year was under the sea.
a few years ago we had really nice limited edition prints for the fairy tale theme.

opening ceremonies is all decked out with the theme too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*

Dang, wah Victorium is going to connecticon üôÅ

Yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*

Ye

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

Too much Zenkai "have you seen my X" posting.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*

Yeahhhhh

I thought that too

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

I'm probably going to turn off notifications for the groups soon.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*

I just systematically leave and wait for next con season lol









**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

On. Point.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*





This has been a photo dump of selfies with y'all

Plz and thank

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

üôå

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-08*

Where'd you get the pistol to take a pic with?!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*

Some dude had it and was trying to sell it for 80 bucks out of his backpack and I wasn't about to do that shit

But I asked if I could take a pic and he said sure

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

Yeet.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-08*

Oh neet

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

Tom has the same face in every Ren photo.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-08*

Yeah I do..

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

Georgia takes photo: I'm a derp

Andrew takes photo:



Totally normal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

then dont make a derp face silly!

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

*I don't try*

but also throw back to shitty ass selfie from last year.



<@!141729881779077121>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-08*

LONG HAIR BILLIAM

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

It was terrrrrible.

Though I think I just hadn't gotten a haircut, i had gone to a shorter style...

Nevermind. Think I went short in the summer.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-08*

ah those days were somethinmg

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

Now I'm 'The RWBY Photographer', you're up and coming in Overmemes community...

what a change.

Also Aaron and John exist.



*calm down there*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

Right? That's what I thought

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

It's the dead fandom person too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-08*

Poor person holding onto their dead fandoms

**Bill** - *2018-05-08*

Watch they setup back to back shoots at the fountain sun up to sun down for fandoms no one but me has heard of.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-09*

fma isn't quite a dead fandom yet 
Please person don't jinx it

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

nah, FMA isn't dead. This is the one with the black butler and inuyasha shoots though.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-09*

Is that person charging for a public photo shoot 
Why is the event photo an ad

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-09*

nah it doesnt have the normal *thispost is sponsored* banner thingy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-09*

tru. But that means when they had to upload an event image they went ‚ÄúI‚Äôll upload this advertisement for myself‚Äù ü§î

~~shoutout to half of those pictures being from the bcc~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-09*

yeeeeeee

**Bill** - *2018-05-09*

Preliminary Next stuff: <@!228287793099440128> welcome to the party, you're on the floor (bring a something to sleep on) in the room with Andrew, John, Aaron and I. The other room already has a pair on the floor, you ain't fitting. <@!288513265661902858> What's my estimate for which days you'll be at Next?

**Andrew** - *2018-05-10*

was there a price chart for next room?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

**Andrew** - *2018-05-10*

ty

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-10*

Same as zenkai
If I can go it'll probably be Thursday night, Friday night leave Saturday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

So what's the status on CPAC for everyone?

I think I may just wanna day trip it for Sunday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

We only bought Sunday tickets

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

That... has been the plan.

For months.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

oh okie

i thought yall still wanted to go all weekend

‚ú® a pleasant surprise that were all going the same time ‚ú®

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

I've been personally wondering if I should for the fuck of it saturday, as I don't have other plans.

But group plan is Sunday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

I didn't buy a weekend ticket ü§∑

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

now what the fuck do i wear lmao

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

neither did I.

Was thinking about it, we have no idea what kind of photo spot exist here. It's also a convention center now, not the campus. So it may be very indoor heavy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

Well im not making anything new thats for sure

so im probably between ladybug, yang, sole survivor, and star

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-10*

Since they still haven't sent my 9s cosplay I'll probably be doing saeran I suppose

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

~~but I don't have enough time to do his route before cpac~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

theres no rwby shoot to think about with cpac so i wont be worried about missing it to cosplay somethin else lol

yang needs love tho

~~but so do all my other freakin cosplays~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

Yea! What else you got?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

not pyrrha, too uncomfy

not weiss, i have enough weiss content for now

so ladybug, star, and sole survivor besides yang

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

I've never seen you in ladybug!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

sole survivor ive worn a lot lately and i probably wanna do a location shoot soon so nix that one...

oh ye bill pointed that out too

and i have a bunch of ladybug stickers i could give out

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

Ladybug and star both got bumps recently.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

I'd say star or ladybug

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

yeah star or ladybug

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

Also Max.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

cause star has a way more active fandom now, which i like, and i love star

but i havent worn ladybug in 5ever, even if the fandom is waning

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

Comfy, popular, and you havent work them in while

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

yeeee

Max i would wear but id rather have reiley around cause theyre the only other chloe i know lol

lonely max is like meh unless its a REALLY small event

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

Bich I showed up 2 years late to the mystic messenger fandom with coffee

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

I'd ride the star fandom picking up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

mmmm u rite

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

Ain't gonna stop me

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

There was ALOT at Zenkai.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

yeah and i really like interacting with the fandom

justin is both my marco and chat noir so lemme see if hes going to cpac lol

maybe ill throw up a poll on my insta

not that thatll decide it, but im curious to see what people wanna see

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

I mean Marco is pretty much a red hoodie.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

yeah tho he has the "i kissed a ninja at karate con" shirt too lol

~~and i have a light blue version oops~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

Aaah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

Then get contacting him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

i have sent le text lets see if he responds

he needed me to sew up a hole in his rocky horror costume anyways so

he has to answer eventualyyyy

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

Good noodles answer back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

/looks at hal, how convenient that must be

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

im like swimming in hals clothes its kinda funny

but also it wouldnt super matter if hal was the same size cause i struggle to cosplay guys oops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

yeeee

i mean you could if you wanted too

just bobbies would still be visiable. i mean even mine are

~~not that mine are necessarily small~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

my face is so baby-ish tho

im like a child

if i cosplay a man i just become a man child

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

anime boys are girly though

~~you dont want my sweet chiseled jawline?~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

my weak-ass jawline could use some chisel yes indeed

why cant people just switch body features for cosplay GOSH

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

dat be sweet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-10*

need some boob? here u go ill lend you some in return for some sick jawline

need some BLUE eyes, hell yeah trade for some green

how convenient life would be

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-10*

need man body? trade!

**Bill** - *2018-05-10*

That sounds gruesome.

*All these RWBY shoot photos are poorly exposed whoooops*

~~I want to die they're actually terrible~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-10*

Bae we should trade cosplay clothes/outfits sometime

Like when we traded regular clothes

I'll look like I'm in a Ryan-ified version of standard cosplay

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-10*

Lmao your prob right tho

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-11*

Ooooo Facebook drama floating around about Zenkai

Someone got molested at Zenkai apparently

But staff rearranged the rooms so that person didn't have to stay there

But didn't kick the guy out of the con it sounds like

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-11*

Crazy stuff my dudes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

where u see dat?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-11*

On the Facebook

Someone I was friends with posted it

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-11*

yikes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

üò¶

**Bill** - *2018-05-11*



Ha.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-11*

hue

mangoloo got an RTX panel

you have to PAY for those damn

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

on what?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-11*

cosplay props

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-11*

wow i cant believe jakescribbles got a panel at rtx

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

pfft

*I hate the exposures on all the friday shoot photos they look terrible*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

I don't see problem ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

*^^^

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

the light quality. the even-ness of tones.

augh!

underlit faces! shadow grain!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Nope right over my head

Though damn I really was the only Pyrrha all weekend

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Bruh

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

***I have standards and i'm not up to them***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

It's a group photo

No one cares about the composure

They care that they are in a pic with other people and don't look derpy

Which even if they do wouldn't be your fault

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

***Technically quality!***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

This isn't a private shoot its just for fucking around

I still see nothing wrong here

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

*Tom has his wig issues I have photo issues*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

üôÑ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah I look pretty good in this photo lol

And we're all posed we'll

~~and the hammer~~

Who am I kidding the hammer IS an integral component

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

*There's no contrast*

*just even*

*even*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Can't you up the contrast?

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

lighting isn't stable enough.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Welp

Show me another one

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

shadows are too prevelant.



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

OMG

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

YAS

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

***Noooooo it's not good enough***

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

NO ONE CARES

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

*deletes everything*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Agidbdhjcidbcubd

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

*No one cares*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Nice üëå

~~still not seeing an issue~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

*~~I actually don't mind that one~~*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

GOOD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah hal looks gorgeous

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Belated thought. During the ghilly face off, why was Vincent like "I especially need to apologize to you".

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

May or may not have just looked at the last pic half expecting Hal to be photobombing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Me?

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Nah, he said it to me.

like.

why?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh yeah idk he probably thought he scared you

As in like the scared that a defensive parent gets

You must've made some sorta face

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

~~I was drunk I was probably making lots of faces~~

Weird.

I mean, I speak for the group fairly frequently, but like. I hold no sway over anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Maybe I made a face

Maybe I had a scared face and you had an anger face

And combined

That explains it

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

eeeeh.

It will forever remain a mystery.

*This is only slightly random; I flipped past a coco picture with him*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Can confirm that cosplay staff weren‚Äôt in charge of the door at Zenkaikon because they were patrolling in ballgowns they spent 8 months working on. Knowing what they make in a day those gowns must‚Äôve been intense omg

Con is back in March because spring break instead of finals week

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah I heard attendance went down from last year

I knew finals week would hurt it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

yeah but it was only down about 300 attendees! plus there were other conventions in the area so that's really not bad, even though a bunch of people couldn't attend we still managed to get new attendees

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeee it's that finals week tho that really killed it imho, I wouldn't have been able to go if my finals had been scheduled around then

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

@everyone I need a short list for Katsu, so I can say if I want to book one or two rooms. Also want to know if the extra 30 for an atrium room is worth it to people.

That includes <@!301927856240459777> if you'll be home, <@!141729881779077121> / <@!228287793099440128> if you want to try Katsu out for the first time.

**Dave** - *2018-05-12*

sure

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Us

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Konkon put up a save the date for Xmas shoot, I blasted the invite to 38 people!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Oof dat my mom's b-day weekend (and Tom's sister and my neice's) üò±

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

isn't that the same weekend as last year though?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Nope last year is was the 16

I did Gingerbread and my mom's bday in the same day though

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

woah shit.

Yeah, that's a day off from being the first saturday in December, which means it would also be gingerbread.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Isn't December 1 the first Saturday

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

if December was one day later on the calendar, Konkon would be the 7th and so would Gingerbread.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh your talking hypothetically

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

ye.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-12*

count me in for katsu

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

that's enough to try and get a double booking.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Also I think atrium is worth the extra like $5-8 per person

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

KATSU WOOOO

yeah we can hang flag

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

I'm game for that, but I'm not sure atriums are in the early block.

we'll find out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Hal is probably a yes too

Just spitballing here

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

I think we can assume that, yea.

So you guys are room hopping, is there anything that's going to need to be dealt with there?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Room hopping?

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

From the old squad to what I'm booking.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh Idk

Some of them are meh now

It's only really ryan and justin I'd wanna see oops

Jackie is a bully and reiley follows Jackie everywhere

And yeah idk I'm mostly neutral

OH actually my buddy Mar wants to come this year too

She's cool

Idk if she wanted to room with me or not tho

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

I tend to room with Mak as well

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

I expected we'd need room for Mak and Ryan. I have problem with them. Justin didn't  stay with us last year, would he?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Nah he likes his solitude

He likes to sleep early so he just gets a room with him and geoff

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Y'all I can get drunk at next katsu I can't wait

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

üò¶

I'm just a baby

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Slong as you don't throw up on anything.

Also you just need the liquor, buying enough at the Gaylord to get drunk would break my budget, let alone a college student.

Hence the flask.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah stupid inflated prices

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh yeah I'm definitely bringing my own

**Dave** - *2018-05-12*

Welcome to the drinking club

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Just remember we ain't Tim and friends and like to remember what we do every night.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

I have yet to black out 
I plan to keep it that way

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah me neither <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Real talk I'll probably just bring a solid supply of hard cider

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-12*

üëå

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Cries trying to think of the order for cosplays for animenext is frustrating

I feel like I have to drop Pyrrha to fit things where they need to go

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeeeee üò≠

Are you doing Weiss?

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

You aren't syncing with anyone outside of the group right?

Star guardians and JNPR.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Hal and I are synced too

And cause he probably won't be there Sunday, that HAS to be angel beats day

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

*he's in the group*

Yeah, but that's the best time for it anyway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Ye with Yona tho you didn't mention Yona

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

I did forget tru.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

So Lux has purple eyes, so if I wanna sync my make up I should do Yona that day

But Hal won't be there all day so he can't do two cosplays in one day

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

^

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Meaning Yona has to be Friday

Which means I cant change into Pyrrha cause the eyes are completely different so I'd have to take all my make up off to switch contacts without posing a danger of getting make up and stuff in my eye

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

~~or live on the edge like me~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Could star guardians happen Friday?

*protect your eyes, you see photos with them*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Formal is Friday too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah I don't fuck around with my eyes üëÄ I need them for NASA

yeah formal Is Friday too

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

And formal was Weiss not Pyrrha.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

So yona then formal pyrrha 
Wait wahhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

BUT it looks easier just to bring Pyrrha

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Formal you're doing Weiss?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Not anymore

I spitballed it a while ago

at this point I'm just frustrated I can't get a cohesive line up üòñ

If I had my way it'd be Pyrrha Friday, Lux Saturday daytime, Yona Saturday afternoon, and Yurippe Sunday

But even then there's only a RWBY shoot Saturday, and Hal can't change Saturday

So it might just be easier to drop Pyrrha and wear Yona Friday and Lux Saturday

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Rip Weiss but you sound stuck.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

What's messing you up? Just the fact that Hal's not there all weekend?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

That and the fact that the RWBY shoot is Saturday

But every way I switch the line up, there's always something that conflicts

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeaaaaaa ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Theoretically Yang and Lux have the same make up?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

What time is da RWBY shoot?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

High n00n

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Any you wanted to do Pyrrha or yang?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

So I could do Yang Saturday morning if I really wanted, it means no JNPR squad but eh I guess at least I'd get to go to the shoot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Don't re arrange your whole schedule for jnpr, we'll still have the formal I think?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah so I guess it's Yona Friday, Pyrrha formal for Friday formal, Yang for Saturday morning, Lux Saturday night, Yurippe Sunday

That's like maximum happiness from that line up I think

Cause it's only missing JNPR but at least we get that from the formal?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

YEA! And we can do PJ JNPR too at night

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh true ~~finally~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

If you want

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeeeee

If I ever say I don't want JNPR assume I've been replaced by a poorly fashioned robot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Damnit Georgia now I can't listen to "my type" without thinking about wait for you to get up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

OOPS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Noted lmao

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Hmmmm

I can't wear ezreal üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Why? üòÆ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Cause when will I

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Oh right you are leaving Saturday afternoon?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah, I aim to leave at 6ish like Zenkai

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

ü§î

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Also anybody gonna be there for Thursday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

We're coming down Thursday after work

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Now I feel dumb 
Are we considering doing star guardians at another con

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

I mean

Yeah fuck the RWBY shoot

You spent a lot on Ezreal bae

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeahhhh 
I don't want to think about it TBH üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

I def think we should do star gaurdians at anext, either Friday or sat

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

Duck I need to order haks wig

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Well, Ashley and Dan wanted Saturday right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Yea

If the rwby shoot is real important, just change right after to lux

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

I mean that would be the plan

But

Ehhhh

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

But it's limited as far as time being with Hal in star guardians.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Would still be like 5 hours

I'm just trying to think of a compromise

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Mm.

It's hard.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

I hate my job and schedule

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

We all do. üò¢

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

üò≠

Hal wat were you thinking for a schedule? Maybe it would help if you both get your schedules down visually? So you can rearrange them and discuss. Just an idea I had

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-12*

I was thinking I could do 2 cosplays Friday +formal

So like Yona, rwby, formal, pj
Then guardians Saturday 
Or 
Guardians, rwby formal, yona (cause yona is just comfy clothes )

Then whatever I need Saturday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Gaurdians all day Saturday?

Does that work for you <@245270932602486784>?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

Yeah I'm just gonna say fuck it to RWBY

Yona Friday, lux Saturday, yurippe sunday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-12*

Cool üëå

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

One costume all day? Mad lads

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

<@!301927856240459777> you won‚Äôt be home for next Katsu right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

;A;

Probably not because the counselors don‚Äôt want me to live my dreams like speedy Gonzalez

Meg and flora and I still have to do fire emblems for Katsu at some point

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

Cause we‚Äôd be sure to have room for you to stay with us. üòÉ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

50/50 chance of sleeping in bathtub or under the table <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

No, at a minimum air mattress.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

WOAH what kind of fancy hotel you runnin

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

üôÑ

So Next is sorted out.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-12*

Luxury anime con hotel room

**Bill** - *2018-05-12*

If you wanted to do something rwby for the weekend, you could bump Yurippe. Angel Beats group didn‚Äôt come together.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-12*

I guess

But fandoms aren't really active on Sundays

No one really cares about fandom stuff Sundays

Idk

Whatever

I'll figure it out

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Tru. Just a thought. I should have the blazer by then, but you never know.

I found smaller rolls of painters tape for cons. üëåüèª

Much easier to toss in bag.

There's a chance I may not be at Castle Point... Some of you know Kathy Chicken, neighbor and one of our "non blood" family members. I don't know if I've shared much about it, but she's been battling cancer for a year. She's in hospice now, and we think she'll be passing within the week. The proceedings would take priority. FYI castle point wise, and for those of you who know her to hear the news.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-14*

thoughts and prayers are with the family then!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

Oh no üò≠ sorry to hear that, keep us informed

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

I'm sure they'd appreciate that Georgia, and I will, though there is... little else to be informed of.

Today's Katsu booking day, le hopefully.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

üôå

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Katsu is on President's day weekend.

You know what I'm going to try?

Booking Sunday night too.

Can drop the last day later if we don't want to pay it, but can you imagine how great it'll be to not have to deal with the sunday check out?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

üòÆ

that would be really nice

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Just expensive, but we can figure it out later.

No Atrium rooms in the first block. I booked two rooms though, we're set.

I'll have to see about switching these rooms to the new block.

admittedly, the imbicle on the phone was useless and I did this online.

Hopefully I can get an intelligent person later to figure out how to go about things.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

they only open a few rooms at a time?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

I know.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

sorry was supposed to be a question

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

do they? they shouldn't, that's odd.

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

This is early bird booking.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

üê¶

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Marisa if you can do a us a huge solid and clue us in on Zenkai's block opening I'd love you long time.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

OwO
I'll try, but that's another department and since staff have their own rooms it's kind of spontaneous. They usually announce it at meetings though so if there's anything about it in the meeting minutes I can give a heads up. next meeting is next month

will accept 70% commission

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Will send love and affection, and/or cat pictures.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-14*

throw in some various cheese and you have the beginnings of a deal

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

nokri dat you?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

I might have an open reservation that'll go through for Mark.

Another tab.

I just have to put down the down payment for him.

I pinged him but he's teaching.

nah shit, I think I lost it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

damn

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

BILLY IS BEST BOI üôå

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Oddly, it's not because of my usual 'call before the block opens and get the hotel to make it' strat.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

did you just call at exactly 9;00 and get through?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

I called at 8:50, got some idiot who was like "The room block opens at 9", at 9 oclock. Then she said to wait 10 minutes, as if timezones worked on minutes and not hours.

I'd have called sooner, but with the train cancellation this morning I didn't get into the office any sooner.

I like to call 30 to 45 minutes ahead of the opening time and then people on the phone usually make the booking.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

well it worked either way!

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

yup. Dare I say it was lucky.

~~Watch I fail to get Zenkai when that opens~~

I actually have to call and see about circumventing the room block, I couldn't last year but I'll try again.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

hack the system

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-14*

So um, I assume you all are going to anime next correct? Lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

ye

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-14*

Woooo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-14*

Ye!

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-14*

Omg yay maybe we'll finally get too meet üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-14*

YE! IM SURE WE WILL!

Depending on the day I may be a girl but that's okay <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-14*

Totally fine üòÇ I'm making one of my other friends cosplay for the first time too so it'll be an awesome weekend

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Do I know them?

<@!228287793099440128> <@!141729881779077121> <@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> No one's got a problem with an extra 35 dollars a night for Atrium view right?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-14*

Total or each?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

each night.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-14*

So long as I'm using it

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Both or none, IMO.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

im cool with it, i love people watching

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-14*

oh wait this is for the atrium, not the extra night

heck yeah

are these the low floor ones

or is that even more

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

No idea.

I figure the college kids might have an issue with president's day, but I can always keep one room till Monday and the other till Sunday.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-14*

if possible try getting the lowest floor you can without a price hike 
yeah thats my concern on bonus night

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

lets see if I can get one at all first.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-14*

Yeah, it's Malcolm <@184437198865563648>

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

oh awesome!

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-14*

Yep lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

no dice on sneaking into atrium rooms, but I do have a note in there for connecting with the rooms I have.

I can try to book two more rooms wednesday with the atrium view, and see what happens.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

what a pain D:

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

It's the rules Katsu set.

~~guess Katsu actually sucks~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-14*

Which means you could transfer the non atrium rooms to our buddies that need them still? Assuming we lock in atrium rooms?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Potentially, yes indeed.

That said, my personal preference would be, in the case Atrium's are all non connecting, to try for connecting first.

I can be vetoed out, and there's no guarantee on the non atrium rooms to begin with, but I care more about being as a group than the view.

ah shoot, I should call the sheraton.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

for adjoining rooms?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

ye.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

yeeeee

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

no gaurentee (as usual) but it's in the notes.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

üôå

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

Well, Sheraton's parent company is getting bought out by Marriott. Next will get me Mariott rewards points, nights, and I can transfer the 'Star points' to marriot rewards.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

Yaaaaay!

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

One night in the gaylord is 30,000 points. üôÑ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

Like you earn that? Or that what you have to pay?

Like if you wanted to use points to pay

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

that's what it costs to get a night entirely on points.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

How maybe point you earn a night usually?

**Bill** - *2018-05-14*

I haven't gotten the points from Zenkai yet, but I don't think it's close to 10,000.

*wow*.

Landcaster is *more* points, it's a tier higher than the Gaylord.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-14*

Wow

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*



Oh noooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

Omg

Who did this?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

omg so random xD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

YEEET

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

people who share rooms with people they dont know for cons are wild

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

yeeee that's insanity.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

like friends of friends is fine but people who are like "does anyone have room for a 21 yr old female in their room?"  LIKE GURL NO

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

ye I saw that one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

im so paranoid I could NEVER do that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

omg the people asking online
that's how horror stories are made

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/10/15/con-shortlist.html Updated with Katsu. Damage for the four night plan is 243.32 a pop.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-15*

Not bad

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

im just gonna start giving you a monthly payment XD jk

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

tri monthly will be fine. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

_what do you mean not bad that's still pretty costly_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

you're still paying for less one night with no split so you can look at it that way ü§∑

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Wut Jess?

Katsu is expensive. Stupidly so.

I personally love the idea of not dragging ourselves in the elevator rush Sunday though.

**Dave** - *2018-05-15*

The damage for the con might be worse, tom has informed me that katsucon is the far away one, I was thinking it was the Pa con. So I might drop out of that one

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

the cost of the whole room for one night is $273.76

so like your still paying for less then one night in perspective

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

ya relatively speaking it's cheap but biru you gotta pack people in there like sardines <:lenny:395307171539189760>
my last katsu was about $105 for hotel

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Oh that's a good point Jess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah it's just the price of the Gaylord is $$$$

If Katsu is as suck next year as it is this year though, I'm probably gonna put more serious consideration into Magfest

Cause 273 plus 60 dollar tickets, the con better not suck eggs

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Same girl.

Tho. With the four day scenario, we'll be in the gaylord sunday evening/monday morning.

When people start leaving by the busload.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

peeps like to hang around until monday especially for katsu. less people at the gazebo :3c

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

exactly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

i dont particularly mind weather its katsu or magfest personally

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Katsu I just hear is more crowded which is mcsuck

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

anyway yea i try to look at the cost of the hotels that way cuz it makes me feel better about spending the monies XD

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Mag will be similar in cost, at the least.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah but I'd be paying the same amount for more net happiness lmao

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Well, the cosplay community is weak at mag, so says both Mag's supporters and detractors. Some people say the rest of the con are rude to cosplayers. Most of the people we know don't do Mag as well, so some of the social aspect will be lost as well.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

mag is a video game con so 99% of cosplayers are from a video games (which shouldn't be a problem with y'all) but that means all the panels and content are different

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Katsu is too packed for photos during normal hours, and outright packed the rest of the time. But at least at Katsu we can chat with all our friends and enjoy the community we love. That's how I've boiled it down.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

o the gazebo is packed at magfest too

also it's a total dude con so keep a buddy with you

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah and I like seeing people, but I also appreciate getting SOME photos

If Katsu keeps growing at the same rate it's gonna be actually impossible to get photos

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

there's outside and the earlier hours of the day. Whole atrium is empty at 9 or 10 am.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

^^^ but then you're going to bed early to get those time slots

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

if we do magfest it would space it better with zenkai next year. but i dont really care what we do

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

if it's sunny there's a really nice beach area out back of the con center, you have to walk to get to it a bit like it's like 4 minutes on foot from stepping outside of the con center. also a ton of sea shells.

that place is always deserted

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

but so cold D:

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah that was starting to get busy too last year Marisa

That's just how crowded the con is getting

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I mean, guys. I brought up this discussion multiple times in the last 3 months. The point was to decide Mag/Katsu *Before* I booked one.

There IS the down payment.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

really?? at what times? last year I went there like 3 or 4 times and it was totally empty

at like 10am and 5pm multiple days

and 3pm

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

This isn't for next year Bill this is for 2020

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

ooooo ok

yea cuz i was gonna say we def talked about this already

id like to try otakon at some point too but i cant see making that drive twice in one year

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

I'm not doing RTX next year so if my internship doesn't conflict I'll be at Ota

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I'll book otakon for next year. I want to go this year, but it's just not lining up right.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

was the beach crowded this year? maybe word of it spread but last year it was 100% empty

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Another thing, Katsu in past years didn't care if you climbed on the rocks and shit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

yea people were out there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

But they ACTUALLY cared this year

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

o they have people patrolling for that ya

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

*Could always do a personal trip to the gaylord just to photo up*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah last year I shot on the indoor rocks all day and didn't get told to leave

This year, bam, right as I touch a rock I'm told to leave

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

not unless we pair it with like sigthseeing in DC and stuff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Like fuck you gaylord, people come here for the nice photo opportunity, if you're gonna be a poopybutt then they're going elsewhere

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

the hotel staff patrols for it at certain times. in 20...15? i think they also had more than usual, we had to jump in the trees when they weren't watching

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

not for me atleast im not driving 6 hours for pics, esspecially cuz people are gonna be watching us like hawks cuz well stick out so much

thats just for me personally though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Yeah^^^^ same

I don't know why Katsu causes a ruckus about it, it's not like anyone's gonna damage the rocks or somethin

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

They trample them flowers
Also I may have almost fallen in the stream. Almost. That might‚Äôve happened to other people and then the hotel is liable to be sued for injury

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

üëÜ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

I'd sign a waiver upon check in then

Which would also oust all those lobby-conners

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

i think the lobby conners are probably the biggest problem

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Katsu was so full of lobby-conners it was annoying

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

Katsu could stop that with the right venue. Zenkaikon has the rights to the entire hotel during their con so they are able to kick anyone out of the hotel if they aren‚Äôt a con goer. The Gaylord probably doesn‚Äôt let Katsu rent the entire thing though because they have other events happening at the same time.

They had to do that because drunk Lancaster locals would make a party of coming to see the con and stand outside the events watching in. They let it slide for the first few years and then it started getting out of hand so now they can kick people out if they don‚Äôt have a badge.

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Zenkai is quite well managed. *Asides from the fountain police*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

that wasnt really the con's staffs fault though, it was the business'

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

true.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

~~and technically the fountain isnt even part of the con~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

it is now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

the hotel owns the fountain?

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I'm saying it has to be a part of the con, cause we *need* it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

sure, but it isnt *technically* part of the con

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

*Technically*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

meaning the con has no jurisdiction over it

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

Con goers have way more swords than lawyers. We can take them.

Zenkaikon usually wins the complements of ‚Äúfriendliest staff‚Äù OwO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

yea zenkai seemed pretty organized, i didnt have any staff problems, but i ussually dont

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

most zenkai staff problems are among staffers themselves
people not getting along, or people being slobs in the hotel room

BoJo switched rooms because the 4 person room was super tiny, waaaay smaller than usual rooms for some reason, and two people took up ALL the space. the closet was packed with cosplay and at least 5 giant props, which isn't normally a problem but usually staff doesn't have time for that at the con. and also 2 people took up all the space in a room that 4 people were sharing. so luckily another staffer only had 3 people in their room and invited BoJo to switch.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

oh das good

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

i'm a little salty at the people i roomed with at animenext. I was WAY too exhausted from staying up the night before but I went to dinner with them and basically fell asleep at the table. we went to applebees and did the 2 for $20 deal they have so we could all split it evenly, but one girl got 2 items for some reason so when we split it everyone basically shared the cost of her extra meal?

also on saturday night another person joined us at the last minute and didn't pay. I don't mind people joining if they're desperate, like they had a room and it was awful, they are 100% welcome to join us if they're having issues and feel unsafe or unwelcome. but this person was just a random friend who decided last minute they wanted to go to the con so they stayed in our room for free

also hogged the bathroom for 3 hours in the morning for body paint, not letting anyone else use the only mirror at all. ; - ; I understand the struggle of bodypaint but 2 people were applying it on the third person so they didn't need the mirror all 3 hours

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

luckily i was able to get out of going to the candy store with them because i literally slept through 90% of dinner and they realized "hey maybe we shouldn't drag you several miles across the city"

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

is this the usual group?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

_marisa why con with these peoples_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

naw these were other girls, the worst trouble I had with them was the brothers from otakon. and maybe one katsu that was a little shakey. omg that katsu was wild.

The room host at Anext was sharing a bed with her girlfriend she hadn't seen in a long time and she kept talking about how "we're really quiet when we're intimate you guys won't even notice anything but we'll try to do it when you're not here" UHH

meg offered me a room for katsu that was nice, but she was having difficulties getting people so I hope she had a good time.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

AND SOME RANDOM GUY CAME INTO OUR ROOM I REMEMBER THAT NOW

that was hilarious

i feel like i've told this story many times before. biru you know it right

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I can't recall.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

should i retell

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

to your heart's content.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

tell the stowy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

so remember how at otakon courtney was kind of upset we didn't have connected rooms? they were just side by side? normally she manages to get us rooms that connect with an inside door. such was the case for this katsu.

court is also a good sport she sends out those surveys about how much people party and how much people mind partying so that like-minded people get sorted into their rooms

the door is usually always open between rooms unless someone gets up super early or comes back super late and shuts it so the noise doesn't bother people asleep in the other room

so Meg and I got put in the party room one katsu, and meg was designated room mom. we were sharinga bed. I can't remember everyone who was in it, zippy and freckles had the other bed I think but they were rarely ever in the room. jalissa and diana were also there. jalissa loves to party. diana is an unhealthy partier and does it anyway.

The table in our room was covered in alcohol, it was like its own minibar. and the gem of this minibar was some drink called Unicorn Blood. on Saturday there was a party going on in some other room so Jalissa and Diana decided to pregame and open up the unicorn blood. they had a few other people that were friends too but I can't recall who. someone in a n inflatable velicoraptor suit was among them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

OMG WUT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

While they were pregaming the front door was propped open because they were literally about to leave. meg and i were just kind of waiting it out on the bed because they were getting really rowdy and we wanted to sleep. they down one last shot and start cheering, some guy walks in the door and cheers with them. He's like "HEEEEEEE-WAAAAIT A MINUTE! This isn't my room!" He turns around and shouts "keep your door shut kids!"

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I remember hearing about the unicorn blood.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

everyone has a laugh, the party goers head out to go to wherever their party was. this was around 10 or 11 at night, saturday. we go to sleep. everyone is back when we wake up, but they can not remember the night before at all. I have some really weird texts from Diana and ask her about them.

(brb getting pizza out of the microwave eyy)

also diana had lost her phone that night but she got it back.

apparently while she was blackout drunk, she cut in line for burlesque and made everyone hate her. she also got lost inside the con and wound up crying in a corner, was discovered by mutual friends who got her more drinks and continued partying until she wandered back to the hotel room at like 6am. more crazy stuff happened to her but I can't remember it. biru if you can pls share. I had a ton of texts on my phone from her and she didn't remember sending any of them.

the moral of the story is don't drink

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

I mean, I wasn't there. The only thing I remembered from the last time you told the story was the unicorn blood.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

the life essence of mythical creatures does crazy things to one's mind

we had many coffee pot instant ramens that weekend

i love con horror stories i collect them like weird trading cards

At animenext two years ago, my friend jab was wandering the con and wasn't answering her texts all day

So we're like okay it's 1 am and we're tired

So we go to bed and assume she will have a key or she'll knock

So at night she knocks and the girl I was dating at the time, Veyda, let's her in

And jab had been added to the room last minute so she was sleeping on the floor and she had said she was okay with that

Apparently though, she was so mad that no one had "kept her in the loop" so she slept in the bath tub

Meanwhile in the morning, I got my period

And I'm like oh damn I gotta get some feminine hygiene on

But jab has locked the bathroom with my pads in it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

WHAT

LOCKED?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

Y E A H

so veydas banging on the door screaming at jab

And I'm like oh god oh god I'm gonna bleed everywhere oh no

And veyda just does dead faced and says "bleed on her cosplay"

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-15*

_which I did not, I ran down the hall and got a pad from Justin's friend_

But she slept in the tub out of anger can you believe that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

i mean I can see it but *locking the door*

that's just evil

the female cashiers here at convenience stores wrap pads up in like 50 bags. they put it in a waterproof plastic bag, then a paper bag that gets taped shut, then another plastic bag which goes in the bag with everything else. hide the shame.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-15*

my worst enemy could come asking me for a pad or tampon and id give them one im sorry but thats just girl code

im not ashamedof it, I didnt choose the period life

but obvi japan is different then here with that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-15*

i was doing a shoot several otakons ago and we decided to do a pool shoot at the hotel and i was like YEAH so i went to put on my swimsuit cosplay and at that exact moment rip. I was in and out of the bathroom in a minute like "nvm i'll just take pictures lets go"
and at the pool was a super curious bachelorette party who kept cheering us on, like "work it girl!" when we were taking pictures

the photos from that shoot weren't atrocious i wonder if i still have them

**Bill** - *2018-05-15*

we moved a little ways away. nobody else showed up for the mlp photoshoot. rip.

there's a club here in akihabara that does anime music (you know it biru <:lenny:395307171539189760> ) and I went there one night to see how it was. super awkward but ANYWAY all the music is from anime and i was there early in the night. the sun hadn't even fully set yet. they're playing typical rave songs and jpop music, with the anime playing in the background on a huge screen, and then a new DJ comes up and puts on the shirayukihime opening theme.
everyone is raving hardcore, headbanging, pumping their fists. going all-out dancing.
to this song.

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

Mark got a regular room, that's good.

and yes, Atrium rooms acquired.

The making sure we have double beds is a good idea, but I have to start working at *some* point.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

Yea lmao

Most likely we do, just check later

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

I'm not updating the price table, but there's an extra 280 dollars involved for Atrium.

*right now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

is that with sunday night in there too?

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

Yes.

One room is 1156 after taxes weeeee

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-16*

katsu really knows how to price gouge
5 years ago we got an atrium room for like $600 the whole weekend

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

But yes, Rooms are booked. we have atrium and regular, one set of which i'll cancel later. And your welcome Jess.

phew.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-16*

gasp, double booking <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-16*

<@!184437198865563648> Before you cancel the regular set of rooms, can you let me know? Justin didn't snag his so I'm hoping you can cancel the first set and he can call to ask for one of them right as you do it

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

I'm in no rush to cancel, sounds fine.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

can you just transfer the room directly to him maybe?

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

Pretty much... I can put his name and info in, change the billing info... Just depends when they actual charge first night's deposit.

I haven't seen the early bird charge yet.

Nevermind I made a chart up for Atrium. Not as bad as I thought it'd be, 280 a person for 4 nights. (Bad as compared to the regular room, anyway.)

At the same time, I got my camera at christmas for about the same cost as two rooms for four nights in this hotel.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-16*

YEET

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-16*

yeahhh up front, i dont think ill be able to stay sunday night

this'll be my hardest school year so i cant afford that monday, and we dont get holiday for that

**Bill** - *2018-05-16*

Yup, I'm not sure what you college kids will be doing but what's important is the option is there.

But also <@!301927856240459777> please let me know when you hear hotel stuff for Zenkai cause that's the con I really care about. ‚ù§

and after 40 minutes on hold, Zenkai's points are on my marriott account.

8,880 between the two nights.

That's actually not bad.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-19*

Sunday morning? You're not going today right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-19*

Nah today I'm getting ramen and chilling lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-19*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

How was the wedding? Looked like a good time!

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

<@!288513265661902858> I'm not sure what a "nomnom" is, but you are welcome to try and come up. We tend to go late, midnight to even 3am on very good night. I make no promises on how much party is left to have, but so long as you get here like, before 10 or 11 it shouldn't be an issue. 

<@!245270932602486784> Yea, shouldn't be longer than an hour and a half. No rush hour traffic this time. :V

<@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> I'd also like to try and get to CPAC around 9:30, 10 too. I'm in need of a good con day.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-19*

Yeah the wedding was fun! The bride encouraged everyone to get smashed lol and I mostly just liked seeing everyone again

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

So you knew people outside of the Geoff's friends table?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-19*

Yeah not many but some of them

It was Geoff's family mostly

And the grooms family lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

Nice.

hey wait.

<@!228287793099440128> Are you going to CPAC?

**Dave** - *2018-05-19*

Negative

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

Why tho.

**Dave** - *2018-05-19*

no real reason

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-19*

Rip I work Saturday and Sunday wtf

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

next week?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-19*

Yeah I work every day except Tuesday

**Bill** - *2018-05-19*

üò¢

Maybe it means you'll get all of Next off or something.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-19*

üò≠

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-19*

Fml

Fml

Nah it means they're using me as much as possible

I probably have 39 hours next week so they don't have to pay over time

*39 hours not including break

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-19*

Ah yes the classic "keep em right under 40"

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-19*



I need to fight my doppelg√§nger

I have to beat someone up

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-19*

üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-19*

Lmaoo 
Me> actually also works with a Marisa dopple

**Bill** - *2018-05-20*

There‚Äôs a maid group doing lucky stars dance at CPAC, it‚Äôs like 2007 and I dig it.

<@!301927856240459777> will appreciate.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-20*

Do they have pompoms

**Bill** - *2018-05-20*

NOW it‚Äôs Nadeko.



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-20*

I don‚Äôt have sound turned on but I recognize that anywhere
FUWA FUWARI FUWA FUWARU
I fell down a small flight of stairs dancing that once. Good times.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-20*

So my friend is trying to squeeze 9 people into one room for ota

**Bill** - *2018-05-20*

.... with those guys?

9 people‚Äôs worth of McDonald‚Äôs for three days.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-21*

He's telling John to pack light and don't shop

Mind you, hes not getting the suite either

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Not the suite, seriously?

Nani the fuck.

Fuck traveling with him.

~~Does John usually pack heavy tho cause he needs to keep in mind we‚Äôll have a floor person at Next~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Nani

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Oooo where are y'all staying at next?

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Sheraton.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Ah gotcha. Assumed so lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah cause bill is a hotel WIZARD

oh my gooooood bill thATS WHERE ALL YOUR LUCK WENT

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah I always book the con hotel. It‚Äôs worth the cost. Helps the vacation feel.

I need good luck with other things, better stop booking rooms.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

üò≠

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Ripppp Sheraton is nice tho. I don't got the hotel luck üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

Sir Billiam is just dedicated

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

Ye he waits for them rooms blocks like a Black Friday shopper

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

That's amazing

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

I mean, watch social media, call the hotel rather than fuck with the online portals. I booked next an hour before the block opened cause the guy on the phone didn‚Äôt care.

Yes, it is effort...

Alright, I‚Äôll shut up and take the compliment.

Thanks.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Still amazing haha. Like I got relatively lucky with my hotel too, but damn you good bill

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

We‚Äôve managed to keep it going for awhile now.

Now that Georgia called it good luck we aren‚Äôt going to be able to get con center Zenkai though. :V

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Rippppp. I'm sure you'll be fine

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

I didn't win the free tickets to ANYC, but if you use code MEADOWLANDS when getting a ticket it's 10 bucks off. Good till Friday, think it might only be for the weekend pass.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

ah rip

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Unless you got a different email, you didn't win either. üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

yea i didnt win either, just took me a little longer to get hte email

the rip was for weekend passes

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

oh ye.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

im gonna have such con withdraw after next

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Yup.

Plenty of time to hang out ourselves though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

cosplay beach day is still a thing in july i guess but idk if anyone else was interested in going

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

I marked interested

Buuuut idkkkk

It's a nice chance to hang with friends I guess, if I can steer clear of most beach day events

Sarah is a little annoying not gonna lie üòÖ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

just hang out wif me üéâ

have you been before?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeeee once

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

wut it like?

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Plus can do our own beach day. Ooh, and get a house for the weekend or something...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

ü§∑

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

I probably wanna do Pyrrha but damn am I tempted to do Team RWBY someone for colossal

~~Weiss is tiny bobbies tho~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

i mean is free right? and cosplay on da beach (cuz i really dont like the idea of cospalying on the beach without a large group since im already self conscious enough on the beach)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

It's 7 dollars I think for the beach fee

But they have no separate fee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

yeeeee idk

im just biased i guess

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Could also get a house for the fun of it.

I get the nerves though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah I mean I'd have fun if I can just avoid Sarah steamrolling everyone

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

i mean the 2 aren't mutually exclusive we can do both if the price on the house isnt a ton? i mean i dont wanna drop a few hundred though cuz to me i could have done another con ~~and i would also like to go somewhere with tom alone this summer which is looking less and less likley~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Also I work every other Saturday which makes it hard üò¨ 75% of the time I can get cover tho

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Airbnb's are supposed to be cheap after all. I dunno, I'd just enjoy it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

the shore ones are still gon' be kinda high though

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Ooooh yeah I have 5 days at the nude photographers house and it was 140 per person which is really nice for a luxury house

Could get like a single condo

In wildwood or somethin

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

~~mawisa come home~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

It's something to look into.

Also, for swimsuit cosplay colossal east and it's water park are likely much better than a beach. Beaches are flat spaces with little to interact with.

So unless you want some dead of alive shit, it's just kinda you.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

sooooo is that a no? orrrrrr

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

For what? I do anything, you know that.

I'm lonely and like to do things with my friends.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

lmao idk im gettin "nah" vibes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

That should be an Instagram description

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Yeah, I don't broadcast I'm a lonely and bitter person publicly. Not exactly a sign of a 'cool person'.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Idk I personally don't like the way Sarah is very high stress and coercive and paranoid at beach day, and figure I would enjoy beach day if I avoid her

Time may be better spent just doing a squad activity or maybe seein Hal imo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

like what does she do?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

She's just very paranoid of creepers and ends up getting so stressed that she needs help from other people

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

and beach day I'll go if at least one of you girls do. Given Sarah's paranoia about creepy guys and the fact I'll have a camera (maybe not though cause sand) I don't want to be there without a woman to vouch for me not being a creep.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

But she also wants to take time to be a model

So Sarah just ends up like crying in front of a camera

Cause she's so stressed but wants to be doing those things

It's just a mess

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

wtfff lmao

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Justin had to be security one beach day

Like security on top of what the beach already provides

She just gives me bad vibes all around too, she's a nice person, but eh

ANYWAYS yeah that's my opinion

"I could probably have fun but maybe there's a more fun alternative" is my opinion lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Sarah is dramatic. There's nothing to say we have to hang out with her at beach day.

Also, I remember seeing one other beach day last year, so the possibility of an alternative gathering may exist.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

i saw one in VA but obvi not doing that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

I recall there being one at the Atlantic City beach??

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

that's it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

But hal and I just got pics on the beach after animenext on Sunday so we were all good lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

~~PPB so much closer thou~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

True facts

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

I mean, if you want to do it we can go, even if Georgia visits Hal instead. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

Also true facts

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

ye

well ill leave it as maybe for now

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

if it's just cosplay, doing Renora out of a con would be a good thing to do too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

at the very least we can get down to the beach as a squad sometime this simmer

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

I need at least three (3) business days warning before going to the beach to mentally prepare to be sunburned and have sand in my everything

But it's fun with friendos ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

its also the whole safety in numbers thing though i feel really weird  cosplaying in "normal" places

im like "AHH DONT LOOK AT ME"

that being said i know a nice waterfall up towards my parents

thats just a side not though

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Very Ren.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*



ooo also childs park in PA

buttermilk falls is off of mine rd, which has many abandoned houseys

and historical locations too

childs park has some old falling apart stone structures too

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

üëå üëå üëå

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

they are all p. much in the same area also

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-21*

_abandoned structures yaaas_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

ooo tilman ravine too

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Beach trip sounds fun imo, if I'm included in the group üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

absolutely.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

the cosplay one? or just to chill?  either way you could come! just the cosplay one someone would have to request you get added too i think?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Just to chill I'm assuming lol. I don't know many cosplayers anymore so if feel awk being added to a group as a stranger

I'm like going to be in glassboro for half the summer so it's be easy for me to do trips and such

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-21*

Looking through Casey's pictures cuz Dave mentioned a Misa cosplayer

Finds the Hals birthday video from 9 months ago.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

Ohhh don't worry the only people I know are the ones from here üòÇ

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Lol fair. I mean still, none of you have technically met me (aside from bill) so I'm a bit of a stranger too lmao. But I'm glad you all are welcoming of me :)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-21*

‚ô•Ô∏è yea of course!

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Marisa and Andrew have. üòõ

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Trueeeeee

Marisa like one time. And then Andrew obviously üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Oh yeah, Marisa *never came to anime club*.

*baka*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

She came the one time when we did the cosplay thing!!!

Although to be fair, I've changed a heck of a lot since freshman year so I'm prob like meeting a new person lmao

OOOOO WAIT

How would y'all feel about going to a convention a Rowan University?

As my last year as president we are finally trying to go through with my mission of setting one up

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

congrats on relection. Start grooming a successor now.

It helps.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Yep that's the plan

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

Operation absorb Kotoricon?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Lol nah itd be different

Would never try and absorb them, but like it'd be cool for Rowan to have their own. We've already done quite a bit of planning

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

that's fantastic. I'd definitely come see it happen.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Yay!

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

~~and walk around like an obnoxious parent saying 'yes, I got them into power, I'm so proud"~~

üòõ

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Lmao come support meeeee

Nah but forreal the organization has changed a hell of a lot

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

kidding of course, I only made sure Jack and his lot didn't win back when they tried to usurp the club.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

I think they graduated. And besides we've scared them away this year

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

niiiice

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

#skills of people who don't wanna deal with their shit

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

"Follow me on twitter, I post pizza jokes"

"Also I want to be president."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Lmao oh god

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

~~that was his speech!~~

Andrew scrubbed him though.

ma boi.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-21*

Yayyyy Andrew!!!

**Bill** - *2018-05-22*

There's a sale on air mattress on amazon right now.

for another 4 hours.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-22*

buy them for a fort

**Bill** - *2018-05-22*

Well, I'm more thinking to have some for cons...

Though Georgia you have one right, and your parents have one Jess?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-22*

yeeet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-22*

I have one my parents have another

**Bill** - *2018-05-22*

So we're good then, really.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-22*

o didn't andru mention something about 9 people
that's usually the max right, 9 people? 8 is standard for a room

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

https://www.facebook.com/events/614251508938198/?active_tab=about

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

That's the day before the shoot mark set up

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

temptinggggg

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

Did you see the 55 dollar price tag?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

yeh and looking at pics i dont think its worth it

that main hall is cool but otherwise meh

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

I'm unimpressed by the shots they put up as well.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-23*

like the main hall sucked me in but the other places dont look TOO great for photo ops

as far as backdrop

**Bill** - *2018-05-23*

ye. agreed.

This organizer has booked the japanese house at the philadelphia gardens though, that's quite legit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-24*

O they do that every year but it‚Äôs super expensive and kind of meh

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

I suppose I should make a plan for Next.

Whoop.

<@!141729881779077121> Ryouma still happening right? Rest of you, spit out what you want. Star Guardians is assumed because it‚Äôs part of Operation Get Ashley Friends.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-24*

Yes

**Bill** - *2018-05-24*

You need to share more progress stuff.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-24*

9s and 2b üòä

On Fri

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

<@!141729881779077121> (I see you online but I know you mute stuff so you get a mention anyway) when you doing Ryouma? Friday?

**Andrew** - *2018-05-25*

prob saturday, i was waiting on the photoshoot list for anext

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

Even with Overwatch being Friday?

I assume you're doing that group shoot.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-25*

I am doing the shoot

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

<@!351785752197201920> As you're the only one talking to Ashley, you have to coordinate Star Guardians. Can't do between noon and 2:30.

<@!350847001937707022> What am I shooting and when are you doing it? You know?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

That works cause RWBY is allegedly 12-1 so I'll still be in Yang üòà

Though I'm frustrated waiting for the photoshoot list tbh

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

Ah, right, so it'd have to be past 2:30. And yes, I know that's when the shoot is, I'll be there, especially since you went Rwby.

And you've asked for no shoot times Georgia, you know I like to have set times for photography work.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

Friday I'm flexible so I'll work around whatever

I'd like to FINALLY get formal JNPR pics cries

Saturday morning I'll figure it something for Yang

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

You realize I have plans formalized yet right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

I'm sitting in traffic right now so I can figure out for sure when I get home

You do or don't?

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

Don‚Äôt.

Figure what you want to photos of first.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

_is Anext really in 12 fucking days_

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

*yuuuup*

so help me help you.

<@!351785752197201920> approximate time frame for switching to Leo?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-25*

pffft no clue

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

I need to give you a time frame before that...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Kw5c4uWp7JpJdpLizYgHfNAeiTN5xs2L5-QYSP704uQ/edit#gid=0

okie im building a schedule too and thus far im pretty free

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

That links to your Zenkai schedule which is apparently trashed

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

I got the Next schedule.

so.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

That's weird

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

nah i cleared the zenkai to use for anext lemme refresh it or somethin

yeah it shows right for me lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-25*

Doesn't matter anyway I don't need it lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

TRUE we can figure out shoot times pretty easy

**Bill** - *2018-05-25*

I mean, you have no schedule asides from your dinner date.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-25*

and cosplay changes

but yeah basically lol

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-25*

<@184437198865563648> so I'd say I'd love for you to shoot Ann and/or kofuku. I'll figure out by tonight which day I'll do what. Kofuku is dependent on when my friend wants to do noragami stuff

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Once you know the day sounds good.

So Georgia, what are the shoots you have in mind?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

1 for hak/yona

formal jnpr if the other half of jnpr is okay with it üòò

yang in the morning saturday

star guardians, which is like, already a given

and sundaaaaay whatever i choose for sunday probably üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Are you interested in Solo Yang? I've never shot it, true, and it'll be a call back to our first shoot (daww), but it is solo.

Tom's gotta handle star guardians, but I have vague idea where that's going.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

ill see what other people are cosplaying in BNE real fast i think someones being raven saturday of Anext i dont remember tho

worst case maybe ill send a post into the void that is the saturday rwby anext FB

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

I know there's a casual trend going around.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

or ill just be like whatever and go solo

o rly

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

yeah, Casual Taiyang and I think Casual somethin else.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

_bill plz its hilarious_

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

*You know I'm not going to call you a ho even for a joke*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

_its not a ho its a pho-ho_

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-26*

PHOHO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

I'll call you a hoe

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Shoot title: *Would you Like to Buy a T-shirt?*

we have no idea when Next is doing the formal right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

noooo clue

anext hasnt released any schedule yet

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

We can do formals pretty late in the day, sun'll be up till at least 8.

So that works.

When depends when the dance is exactly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

Wait

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Imagine 9s singing it like Elsa.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

But whyyyyy

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Remember the whole 9s saying they should get tshirts after everything is over thing...?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

Yeaaaaaa ok

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*



and all the ship images where they get them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-26*

Good boi ‚Ñ¢

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

<@!141729881779077121> Boi I need a lineup.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-26*

Soldier and Ryoma. Dont have the time/money/talent to do more atm. As for when,  havent looked into that

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

*You are as talented as you want to be boi*

But yeah, I need time frames.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-26*

You said the OW shoot was friday?

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Saturday.

1pm.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-26*

Hmm. I havent seen an FE shoot posted yet so im not sure about ryoma

I believe one was submitted to anext but theres no FB yet for it

at least, an open one. Apparently theres a private one

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

which means they'll have little time to get people together for it.

Next dropped the ball on managing shoots, but neither here nor there.

Thinking Ryouma Friday?

**Andrew** - *2018-05-26*

Yea, I dont mind if i have to change on friday

Sounds good, maybe later in the day?

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

yeah, wait, why are you changing then?

3pm?

**Andrew** - *2018-05-26*

3pm is good

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

kek

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-26*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-26*

Cursed text

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-26*

YEH I HUST RETWEETED THAT TIO

Blessed truth

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-26*

Yaoi paddles lmao

**Bill** - *2018-05-26*

Good times.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-27*

heads up if anyone's going that there's going to be a Shakira concert near the convention center in DC the same weekend as Otakon
so super crowded even more than usual
some friends were considering doing a zootopia cosplay group and going to see shakira but otakon is expensive enough as it is

~~they should just invite shakira to otakon tbh~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-27*

<@!288513265661902858> you‚Äôre joining Meg‚Äôs Franxx group for Katsu? That‚Äôs awesome!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-27*

Ya

Tbh I'm a bit frustrated that Erik got gorro first

But what can ya do

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-27*

Ye he'd fit either one of you

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-27*

It's just the rest of the guys are so much shorter so I feel weird being taller then everybody

**Andrew** - *2018-05-28*

Who are you?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-28*

oo oo
oo oo

**Andrew** - *2018-05-28*

In franxx

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-28*

Is that LOST

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

mitsu boi

**Andrew** - *2018-05-28*

Is that angsty or married man version?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

Married Man ~~with minor memory loss problems~~

**Bill** - *2018-05-28*

Maybe I should skip Nexts formal...

**Andrew** - *2018-05-28*

I'm debating trying it this time

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

<@!228287793099440128> The current plan for driving down to Anext is Tom/Jess/Justin/Rayna in one car, then I'm going to pick up Georgia on the way down since she's a 10 minute or so detour. Would you like to come with me as well?

**Dave** - *2018-05-29*

When are you leaving?

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

Good question.

Earliest would be 4ish. Otherwise whenever you'd get there.

Actually, not even, you're off 80 I'd probably go to you.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-29*

Earliest he could get home would be 5

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

s'long as it's right after work, the time itself is pretty flexible.

**Dave** - *2018-05-29*

I'm taking a half day on the 7th, so it would be when you're ready to leave

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

yup. You'll ride with me den?

**Dave** - *2018-05-29*

Yep

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

coo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-05-29*

anyone want to pick me up too <:lenny:395307171539189760>

i can meet you at the airport in chiba how's that sound

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

oh yes v. convenient

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

https://www.facebook.com/animenext/posts/2082011125160834 Next shoot schedule. Apparently there's a friday RWBY shoot now.

and a star shoot, it really has resurfaced as a fandom.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

i just saw that.

was loling at the fact the the one says "photoshop" instead of shoot

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

I like that they're going to have two separate overwatch shoots for some reason.

**Andrew** - *2018-05-29*

Overlapping too

No FE official

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

Nah, it formed late.

Next did a shit job (surprise surprise) managing photoshoots.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-29*

WOW THATS SUCH A POOEY LITTLE CHART

i admire that they tried but

damn

i just

i cannot even

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

theres a calendar version too idk if that makes a difference

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

badge pickup from 6 to 9pm at Next thursday. That sounds great, tbh.

I might wanna do that Star shoot friday, hmmu...

Also Georgia will you be working thursday of Next?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

i guess they are showing sailor moon the musical on thursday? idk if thats of interest to anyone but

https://www.facebook.com/events/1071984082939867/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-29*

depends what my money looks like at the time but prooobably not

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

its at "The Bourbon Room" lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

Then maybe I‚Äôll work later Wednesday so I can bolt sooner like Dave...

We could get down there nice and early. That‚Äôd be cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

i can also take a half day most likley but idk if tom wanna

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

You also have Justin and Rayna to deal with.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

they are vacation all week\

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

Fucking rip.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

at least i know Justin is, raynas hours are more par diem

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

Still, potentially really cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-29*

im going to be taking the half day either way so

**Bill** - *2018-05-29*

I‚Äôll talk to Gord tomorrow about how early I can skip out on the day. Be cool to get down like 5, check in, get badges, and have some time to do stuff even before the sun sets.

https://www.facebook.com/events/580479238975907??ti=ia rip

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*



**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Whoever that is unfollow them.

üëåüèªüëåüèªüëåüèª

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

They a girl at least lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

That does help drastically.

Panelist had it right, guys do not choose to get into boudoir, they get asked to.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

What ya mean

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

She basically said if you‚Äôre a guy trying to get into boudoir photography, you‚Äôre going to be seen as creepy. Just because you‚Äôre a guy and boudoir is predominantly women.

It‚Äôs just fact, a guy volunteering to see a woman in her underwear, and photograph it? It‚Äôs inherently a bit uncomfortable. Even with a woman photographer there‚Äôs some grade A awkward going on.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Very true ye

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Then there‚Äôs always what if the model accuses you of something, innocent or not? Some photographers may be inappropriate but you sure as hell don‚Äôt want a false review saying you were if the model wants to spite you. You‚Äôll be effectively black balled. (Recommendation with that is always have a woman witness with you, as a third party observer. Also an assistant photography wise, win win.)

So the only way I figure a guy would get involved in boudoir is if a friend asked them to do it.

<@!245270932602486784> you will have class Thursday for Next right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Yeee

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

When would you be able to get back, Day 0 Cosplay up?, and be ready for pick up?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh lemme do the maths, are we cosplay Thursday?

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

I ain‚Äôt. Dave ain‚Äôt. Tom and Jess ain‚Äôt I think.

But there is badge pickup to show up in cos for.

Tho, Yurippe?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Might just throw on my vault suit with my regular clothes if only cause that's a very quick change

Hmmmm possible

Yurippe has bloo eyes so it would work

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Well, that decision aside, timeframe?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

to be back at my house and ready to go?

id ballpark it like ~5

maybe 4:30

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Mmhm Kay.

We‚Äôd leave 3 or 4ish, which isn‚Äôt much earlier than if I start early.

Well, just decide Day 0.

do we know when the dance is if the schedule is out?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-30*

i havent looked at full schedule yet

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

<@!288513265661902858> you know for sure what your Next nights will be?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-30*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

as of right now I'm just hoping I can go without having to pull multi hour round trips to get to work and back home in time for work the next day

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

lets try this, when *will* you know?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-30*

one would hope this friday afternoon

but theres potential for me to not have a schedule till sunday

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

lets hope for friday then.

I need to figure out the split for everyone else.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-30*

If you're looking into how you should include me in the split, 
you should go with  a payment assuming I'm not coming at all, 
and a payment assuming I make it for thursday friday nights

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

well ye, I need to know which to do so people can send it. üòõ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-30*

start with assuming I'm not coming, if I do come, I can just pay them my share divided among party members like with zenkai

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

I mean we can just wait it's no hassle for us lol

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

John asked.

no worries, as soon as you know let me know Hal.

wow, Mangaloo went to Colossalcon today. IE, Day -1.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

She's got a packed schedule

Lifestyles of the ~~rich and~~ cosplay famous

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

I figure she went to fuck around tbh.

Kalahari is great, 10/10 would go wednesday night too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

Her story is just so meme-y gosh

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

that's the public persona.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-05-30*

OOF FRUSTRATING I get it but like

I like Real‚Ñ¢ people

**Bill** - *2018-05-30*

Same here.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-05-31*

time off for next got approved üëå

i took half day thursday weather i use it for con or not

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-05-31*

**Bill** - *2018-05-31*

I'm good to leave early for Next thursday too.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-05-31*

Pst t minus 7 days till next woooooooo

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

<@!141729881779077121> going to go and defend your title?

https://www.facebook.com/groups/zenkaikon/permalink/1963865740293035/

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

*You right, I have no friends, tanks*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-01*

Gotta have friends to shout,greybeards didn't tell me that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-01*

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

This just reminds me I need a new profile picture.

<@!184440044822462464>



Not sure what to say to that.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-01*

THANK YOU COMRADE

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GwVaeOkymk&feature=youtu.be Zenkai Vlog yall

Officially drops tomorrow but friendos get sneak peek

not sure how crazy i am about the sound balance, might still tweek it, its different in the youtube as opposed to editor

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

Whoop dat nice.

Other people‚Äôs voice are hard to hear tho, you need like a mic attachment or something.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

yeah thats true

also i should try to record outside of crowded areas as much as possible

**Bill** - *2018-06-01*

Eh, that part is natural. Might be the mixing thing you mentioned?

I dunno video.

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-06-02*

if only i was good enough for that contest

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Do it anyway.

Hal, you find out work schedule?

**Dave** - *2018-06-02*

all praise the t-rex

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

not yet :c

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

*serrrrrriously?*

You charge for the events outside of the christmas one, spend that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

thats so weird

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

somehow completely missed the video til jes said something <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

love how literally 100% of the scenes im in I cant sit still ~

watching all the pictures flowing in on the collosalcon page like 
http://www.bodyasdoctor.com/images/kid-looking-out-window.jpg

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-02*

me @ every con this year

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

SIGHHHH everyone is going to otakonnnn

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

whose everyone?

I thought a good portion of our con friends weren't going this year. Mark, Gen and friends, etc.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

Everyone on Instagram :c

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

I mean, I wanted to go, but no hotels nearby, crazy parking, time off from work, expensive... It's just not worth the effort. I'm going to book it next year, but this year is a just a wash.

I blame RTX.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

RTX is very likely to blame yes lol

And are all the hotels really already booked solid?

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

It's two months to the con, anything easy walking would be.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

I remember the crapload of hotels by the con center though, huh

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Not to mention Hal can't, you're on vacation, Tom and Jess aren't huge on the travel, Marisa is in japan, so the current group looks like it'd be me and Andrew.

John and Aaron rock the with Seth and the card gamer gang.

But also like said before, alot of the people we know aren't going. That's a real downside to me.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-02*

i can tell people i know who are going to look out for you and befriend you

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

Oh yeah I'm on vacation so I can't even go if I wanted lmaooooo forgot

That makes the FOMO less bad

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Yo had to look up fomo and im glad that word exists

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*



**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Oh I saw one of those at Katsu. Couldn‚Äôt go for some reason.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

Oh and Georgia can be Max. That counts too

And we'll be like "oh I thought it was for photographer characters opps"

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Heh, that‚Äôs be neat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

omg thatd be hilarious

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-02*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

The earliest you should expect me is 4:00 probably

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

4 pm on saturday through sunday?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Nah I work Sunday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

dAMN no formal what a suck that is

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

I was thinking

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

OH

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Showing up at 4 on Friday, and Saturday

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

And driving back down? Sure you won‚Äôt burn out doing that?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Haven't decided if I want to spend the night Friday and drive to work Saturday morning. Or leave Friday at 10ish

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

Don‚Äôt want you in an accident on the highway.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

^^^^^

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

I'll be eating

Plus I don't start work till 8/9 so I get an actual nights rest

Cause not fasting

I drove back and forth to ota before, this is about the same drive

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

stupid work

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Also tbh if my cosplay arrive like they should

There ain't no way in hell you can tell me I wasted that money not to wear at least one of them for a bit

Plus I wanna be there for formal

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

/doki

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Cause I'm a romantic

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

I‚Äôm just thinking doing it back to back would suck.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

/doki _intensifies_

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

If you‚Äôre confident that‚Äôs fine though.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

It stinks, but it's not unmanageable

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

If you üêù üçÅ in yourself

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Tbh I might stay Friday night and drive to work Saturday morning before y'all get up

Gf cuddles are a wonder for the soul

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

true facts, they have healing properties

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

It's a 1.5 hour drive, so it's not to bad 
Especially since I'm eating and all

Which is extremely rejuvenating post fast

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

So you‚Äôll stay Friday?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Maybe... it depends on the drive up tbh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

~~gotta know for the hotel cut though~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Assume not, then send me the amount I'd owe everyone individually if I did

Hey y'all way in advance but my super awesome friend was wondering if at next zenkai they can room with us

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

I read that as bee-canada

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

What

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

üêù üçÅ

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Ohhhh

Yeah same

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

(which fren)

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-02*

Good stuff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

AS LONG AS YOU BEE CANADA

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

My good high school bud named Jordan

She is a former homestuck, if you remember a Roxy...? With a completely knit dress that's her

She also was like one of the OG Pantskri

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

NOT PANTSKRI

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

Like if you went to the draw stuck at Katsu... 4? Years ago, that was her

She's a mutual friend of Mak and I, and was the person who was significant in introducing me to cons

She's a smol kind person who loves to knit all the things

**Bill** - *2018-06-02*

It‚Äôd be helpful if you could decided sooner rather than later Hal, but we‚Äôll run with not staying. I don‚Äôt like dealing with money issues at the con. 

Zenkai‚Äôs a way off, but I usually want to know the person before I offer them a room Hal. üòÖ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-02*

so you have a year to meet them whoopee

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-02*

They go to katsu

Also I may do a separate room in the unlikely  scenario you two don't end up meeting. 
But like ya said 
Zenkai is far away

**Bill** - *2018-06-03*

Katherine is going to Next? That's surprising <@!350847001937707022> .

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-03*

Yeah she's part of the noragami group I was talking about

**Bill** - *2018-06-03*

Oh wow, neat.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-03*

Yeah haha. We got closer this year surprisingly, so she's hyped to go to the con üòÑ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-03*

UGH I JUST REMEMBERED WHEN ETHAN AND CASEY GOT FAKE MARRIED

or engaged at least

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-03*

UGH

**Bill** - *2018-06-03*

*I aww‚Äôd at that*

üòê

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-03*

packing for anext: swimsuit is a yes just in case right??

**Bill** - *2018-06-03*

Jess says yes.

Ooh, now I wanna do that when I get home.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-03*

I'm also gonna throw in a casual Pyrrha

Just in case üòè

Also they'll be my civilian clothes LOL

**Bill** - *2018-06-03*

And pajamas. Don‚Äôt forget those.

<@!228287793099440128> and Georgia, since y‚Äôall have floor you have sleeping arrangements?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

Air mattressss

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Yea bathing suit whoo!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

Okay so Hals Hak isn't gonna get here in time and I don't wanna bust my butt to finish Yona last minute and hate it, so we're just gonna bump that to colossalcon

So FINAL Anext line up



So <@!184437198865563648> I hope your Angel Beats Jacket is good to go for Sunday lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Me, not 5 minutes ago, thinking about packing: *Well, it'll be easier to pack because Yuri got bumped.*

I pick it up wednesday afternoon/thursday morning, depending on if I work from home wednesday.

**Dave** - *2018-06-04*

i have an air mattress too

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

kk, just making sure you're good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

I kinda wanted to give ladybug Friday anyways so

It's almost a relief to bump Yona

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Pretty sure there's a group shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

for Yona? eh whatever

im not gonna stress myself cause then ill rush it and hate it and wanna remake it

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

No, for bug. I think pushing it is an good idea.

1pm Friday.

Thought it was at 3, that's Star.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

1 pm friday is ladybug? sweet

does that change our time to shoot then ~~maybe i can borrow a chat noir~~

hal is gonna throw together adrien too, cause he has the wig and clothes, just needs to paint stripes on a black shirt

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

But he won't be at the con till 4?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

ya so we could match for like... 2 hours before formal

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

unless you end up changing for the formal early so we have time to actually take photos...?

<@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> have 1pm, if they cool with it they can take 2pm slot instead and we can do the bug shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

hmmm good point

when IS the formal did we get a time yet

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

no idea.

Haven't seen the schedule.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

7 pm

aight so we prob wanna change to be able to shoot/get in line by 6?

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

prooooobably?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Doesn't matter tonmeeee

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

<@!245270932602486784> 5 oclock you said you'd be good for pick up?

k, Jess and Tom we do 2pm, and we'll do the bug shoot Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

And star gaurdians at 3?

On Sat

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

2:30.

wait, shit.

we can't do that.

Hal won't be there.

Ezreal is coming in time right <@!288513265661902858> ?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

/shrug

I know the wig is here

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

,...

Is it *expected* to be here?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

If you email them they should be able to tell you

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

I'll double check the tracking tonight

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

There are other people involved in this shoot, Ashley and Dan, we need to keep them in the loop if we need to push the time back for you.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

Its through USPS 
I'm out atm  but when I get home I'll check 0ackage tracking

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Please, thanks Hal.

The delivery window might be a good estimate as well.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

I gave up on that

Delivery window suggested it'd be here last week latest

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Ah, fuck them then.

Gotcha.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

yeahhhh it probably won't be here in time

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Wait, did you look already?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

i was just picking up pizza like 5 minutes from my house 
And georgia and I were looking at it last night so it was still open on my cpu 
I wish I spent the extra 40 dollars for shipping TT_TT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Where is it? Like it's allready been shipped? Or they haven't shipped it yet?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

I think its still at the first checkpoint enroute from china

the wording is odd but thats what it means

so it probably won't get here until a week after anext knowing my luck

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Ugh üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

*Shit*.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

i wish I paid the extra money but like fuck 
Between ezreal and Hak I already spent like 300 dollars for costumes wigs and shipping

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Was Hak from the same place? When was e supposed to arrive?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

yeah he was, he hasn't started shipping yet (probably cause custom order) 
But once he does he's supposed to arrive in 2/3 days

I didn't realize custom ordering it would mean I'd have to wait an extra month for something to ship

cause thats the only explanation i can think off

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Ez cosplay? Or miccostumes? Or another site?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

skycostume

they're usually p reliable from what I've heard

I don't trust ezcosplay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Ohhh I never heard of them. Tom's Ren and my Nora shoes are from EZ our 2b 9s and star gaurdians are from miccostumes

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-04*

sky seemed to have the most accurate for the best price but rip i guess

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Ez worked for the AB jacket.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Prayer circle for Hal's cosplays

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

üôè üôè üôè

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

...Tankcon?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-04*

üôè

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

<@!351471675843411978> you know you if Justin and Rayna are formalling?

Also, Jen and Jeremy are coming for the friday of Next! üòÑ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

I am not sure. ü§î

and neat!

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

<@!245270932602486784> 5 oclock on thursday was good right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

You

Yup I mean

but yeah you good too billiam :V

**Bill** - *2018-06-04*

Everyone go yell at Gen's story to come to colossal east.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-04*

DID IT ALREADY

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Since Andrew asked, there‚Äôs not supposed to be a refrigerator in the sheraton. It‚Äôs dumb.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-05*

Microwave?

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

Also no. So the Sheraton has deluxe and regular rooms, in interest of cost I booked regular. You can guess what‚Äôs in the deluxe. That said, they have standalone microwaves and refrigerators they can provide, I put it in a request. Much like connecting rooms, a first come first serve thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-05*

That's goings to take up precious floor space

**Bill** - *2018-06-05*

That is true.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-05*

lmao Sheraton is such a rip off as usual

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

Yeeeeaaaaah but it‚Äôs close.

The Chestnut hill sign up sheet seems... small.

**lizi** - *2018-06-06*

I wish we could go this year but we can't üò¢ and I was reading on anexts Facebook all the issues people are having with Sheraton due to some booking error.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

oh gosh i heard about that

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

~~Tis why I called earlier~~

I'd flip a shit man.

Animenext is such a mess though. Maybe next year Bally's really is the way to go, though Sheraton is being bought by Marriott end of the summer so that might clean up the hotel a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

ballys is farther too

and the shuttle was pretty shit so i hear

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

Everything about Atlantic City is shit.

**lizi** - *2018-06-06*

Yeaaa I mean. We walked it  cause it's not bad walking through town through the outlet stores. It's the other streets you don't wanna be on XD

And get a total rewards membership. You get good discounts on rooms and sometimes they're free.

Or free food credit.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-06*

I'm staying at Bally's this year so I can let you all know how it is

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-06*

i got kicked out of caesar's casino on christmas once
their rewards cards used to be really awesome to get people to gamble more (whole weekend stays for free). now we only get free buffet coupons. tho during a con that could save a life

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

How did you get kicked out of a casino? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-06*

security asked me to leave <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

But lol cuz of Cosplay?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-06*

naw <:lenny:395307171539189760>
you know what a lawbreaking troublemaker i am <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

I hear lots of theft at this year's colossalcon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

Yea you sure are. And o really? That's so shitty

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-06*

yeah a friend got $60 stolen, stuff going missing in rooms reportedly.

that seems to be happening a lot though at a lot of different cons. attendees blame the room cleaners but i wonder if it's not actually other room mates

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

Yea i was wondering that too

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-06*

there was one time all my junk was moved so they could make the bed and that freaked me out but everything was still there

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

Yea alot of people were complaining about that after katsu too

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-06*

Ooo yeahhh

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

<@!228287793099440128> , what's your address?

**Dave** - *2018-06-06*

9 eyland place succasunna

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

wow, you aren't even a detour.

Nice.

**Dave** - *2018-06-06*

When were you going to leave tomorrow

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

figuring it out now.

2:30, s'long as we leave your place by 3 we're on track for google map's estimate to Georgia's. That conservative for traffic, so we'll see what happens, may be earlier. <@!245270932602486784> and <@!228287793099440128> 
I'm leaving; 2:30
Dave's: 2:50
Leaving Dave(s): 3:00
Georgia's: 5:00 (google maps says 2 hours, but part of that time is traffic based. Whoops if we get there earlier)
AC: between 6:00 and 7:00.

early badge pickup is 6 to 9 I believe, so we can rock that.

**Dave** - *2018-06-06*

Roger Roger

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

actually might be later to AC.

closer to 7.

Hard to estimate traffic on a multi stop trip.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

we'll prob leave around 4-ish

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

Yeeeet

I'll probably just throw on my vault suit with normie everything else tomorrow then

Unless we're gonna get dinner or something in which case I'll just be me lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

No concrete plans... I'd say either eating after we get badges somewhere or stopping between you and AC.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

~~McDonald's McDonald's McDonald's~~

~~bill pulls into drive through, one black coffee~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

I drink my coffee as sweet as Ruby does though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

im not with you so you can actually do that if you want üòÖ

~~the black coffee is for me~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

yeah, that's about it for plans though? I had the thought visiting the pool thursday night could be relaxing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

POOL

DO IT ~~i probably wouldt be there in time but w/e~~

there also that sailor moon musical thing

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

pool closes at 10, you might make it for a bit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

YAAAAY

*skips registration for pool*

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

also it's going to be like, 80 tomorrow. Warmer south. I'd skip the fallout suit for that alone.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

Shorts and t-shirt for me fam

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

~~no seven jacket~~

**Dave** - *2018-06-06*

Anyone bringing drinks? If not I can hit up El liquor store before bill picks me up

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

I'll be getting a bottle of whiskey later.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

For da flask? :V

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

mm... Though I'm not going to drink quite as much as at Zenkai.

Zenkai was a bit of roller coaster.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

I'll probs pick up vokda tonight or tomorrow

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

Wait so yes or no on the microwave

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

maybe. There's a request for one. No guarantees.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

I'll being mac and cheese just in case then :3c

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

maybe this year we'll do what what we did for Zenkai and pull up in the circle area, check in, get a cart, unload, and I'll ditch the car in the garage after.

Then we can leave stuff behind.

@everyone REMINDER that elevator hell is a thing. Sheraton has more elevators that Landcaster, but the point stands. Might be useful to have a carryable bag for sunday, if you want to move the rest of your stuff saturday night or something. Manly relevant for people with bags that cannot be stair carried.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

thats a great idea in theory but in practice....

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

Really annoying?

I know.

All my bags are carryable. :V

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

so are mine

like i die, but i can carry them if i have too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

Mine ain't lmaoooo

I'll load up Saturday afternoon/night then

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

it's up to you, I don't think Next was really bad getting out last year.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

nah i dont recall it being a struggle last year

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

Also get cash before getting there if you want some for dealers.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

ooo i found a twenty in my wallet yesterday idk where that came from

do i owe you money billy?

like from cpac?

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

5 bucks. I forgot about that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

whooo!

<@!351785752197201920>  remember to get dah cash monies

~~did we pay you for next yet?~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-06*

Nope.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

kay i dont have the paypal login but tom will do laters

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

Make up brushes washed, got a new set of fake eyelashes that Meg recommended to me, the air mattress sheet is washed and all packed, the first half of Lux paint is dryin

P R O G R E S S

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-06*

Coffee pot Mac and cheese!?

Genius

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-06*

Yay

Not yay for vanilla pudding tho

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

if matters to you Georgia/Dave, I plan on abusing our 3 person car by having suit on hanger. Hate packing suit jackets.

So you can as well, within reason.

Other reminders, <@!141729881779077121> soldier jacket, <@!245270932602486784> civvies, pajamas, rave stuff if you‚Äôre interested.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-07*

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

reasons to stop buying shit at cons: I forgot I bought keychains at CPAC until I just dug them out of my camera bag.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-07*

yea probabl;y

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

*Do... I call to see if there's a hair dryer in the room...?*

*I'd assume so, but the Sheraton is a cheapass hotel...*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-07*

omg i'm going to acosta on sunday we can all cosplay together internationally

sunday night for y'all

hair dryers are usually staples in hotel rooms aren't they

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

You'd think.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-07*

sheraton is more upscale i'd imagine they have one. even super cheap ones usually have them

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

*I called.*

They do.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-07*

I'm mostly done were just out of bags

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

Look, I dunno, Sheraton is pricey gougey enough to make it a deluxe feature.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-07*

We'll do a call in cosplay <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

Somehow a lenny works.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-07*

lmao trying to explain why i needed so many cloths for the weekend was weird lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

*fancy dinner parties*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-07*

yea..... totally

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

do you want to tell them you're running around in 2Butt?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-07*

hell no

im gonna take the one that closer in size to yours

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

So if the line for AnimeNEXT is more than 30 minutes long, I apparently have a way in earlier

My friend runs volunteering so if the line is like two hours long, he can have us volunteer to help check in people for 30 mins and then he'll sign us in right then and there

What a kind offer dayum

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-07*

Wowwee

VIP PASSES

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

Yeah we would just have to stuff the con goody bags for 30 mins and then boom we get our badges

That's way better than standing around for 2 hours

So we'll see how bad the line is when we get there

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

aaaah it's adorable.

I think Audrey made a new facebook to have one without her dad on it.

The account has friends hidden.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-07*

Hmmmm

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

Apparently this.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

Bill what time are we shooting bug again

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

We weren't shooting individual bug, just the 1pm group shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

That's different from the public bug shoot

ohHHH

~~would you have free time on Friday by chance~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

I'm already at 5, buttttt prom photos is a pretty chill shoot and meeting new people. Sure.

<@!141729881779077121> Ryouma is still on right? You haven't talked about it much.

**Andrew** - *2018-06-07*

Yes, ryoma is still on

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

Best boy Bill üòò

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-07*

I'll ask her

**Bill** - *2018-06-07*

I'm bringing this power strip tower thing I got off amazon ~~because I have a problem~~, it's got like 12 plugs and 4 usb ports.

Current google maps say 1:30, so will be more like 4:30 <@!245270932602486784> Slong as your home idc if we need to wait (buffer for more traffic cropping up), but I low key don‚Äôt want to show up there if you aren‚Äôt there. üòÖ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-08*

Nani

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-08*

stuffing bags and assisting registration is a gofer duty and gofers usually get compensation in the form of free food, convention merchandise, and if you work enough a free badge

and you get a little ribbon on your badge that says gofer

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-08*

But, ... Did I miss something? Why Is she a gopher? Owo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-08*

Question, if I'm arriving in 50, should I bother with normal jaune

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

I'd just go straight to formal

Personally

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

Georgia wanted you to come in formal earlier. Just formal.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-08*

I was unaware of that

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

She didn‚Äôt say it on discord.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

Get online for formal at 7:30?

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

The formal is 7 right?

You mean 6:30?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

Yea sorry

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

Also Georgia realized Hal will need his badge first. So they‚Äôll need to get that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

Yea

Does anyone wanna go to the pool? Just trying to see if there's interest?

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-08*

Have fun at the formal friends!!

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

Not before the formal, at the very least.

I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll really be able to do formal jnpr tho. Not enough time.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

??? You mean pics?

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

We should really aim to have *everyone* in the formal from the start, not stuck in lines.

Oh yeah.

Pictures.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

Oh ok cuz I was like lol wut

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

Were you trying to pool before formal?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

I'm not really trying to do it any particular time. But I could do it now

We're not doing anything but I could go to dealers or something

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

I mean, as I said I ain‚Äôt trying to before formal.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

Yea so NBD maybe after?? Maybe  ü§∑ I'm just going with the flow

**Bill** - *2018-06-08*

Formal photos are shot, so I‚Äôm done with the camera today. üëåüèª

So I can do whatever people are doing. I cleared my sd just now so I‚Äôm set. Whatever you guys do I can join.

Dealers could be nice. If you don‚Äôt want to just come back and formal prep. ~~Gotta get a good buzz for dancing~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-08*

<@!288513265661902858> where u go

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-08*

Are they doing cosplay wrestling again this year? Is that in the schedule

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-08*

Ye I think is tomorrow

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-08*

Does it have a specific location

Last year they relocated it at the last minute because the ring wouldn‚Äôt fit up the stairs so they just. Had it in the middle of the first floor.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-08*

Yeee I remember that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-08*

Their early events were really really awesome and well thought out but recent it‚Äôs been extremely meh and the runner got into an argument with the Zenkaikon chair a few years back so they‚Äôre basically banned from that

I hope they get that spark back

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-08*

There's an Elias at the formal with 2 chises

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-08*

WOAH Elias chill out there
Magus bride but it‚Äôs a harem

~~please tell me someone got a picture~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-09*

They are still going but nah

Other side of dah. Big.room and it's a lil too lit to waltz over

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

Selfie stick shot with Elias and his chises in the waaaay background because the selfie stick is like 30 feet in the air

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-09*

Hahaha yesssss

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

Can someone provide deets on the fire alarm

Did the rave catch on fire

acosta opens at 10 and i'll probably be ready to leave the changing room by like 10:20 or 10:30 but it depends on if the people around me are done and i'm able to get out
but that's like 9:30pm your time so if anyone is free at 10:00pm or later your time we can international cosplay party

**Bill** - *2018-06-09*

Will do. Though plans rave, so the party might just be everyone frantically waving at the screen.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

that's still a party <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:weiss_dab:453322434100068373>

you must be the one

**Dave** - *2018-06-09*

I don't have a physical body to open things...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

that's ok we can work this out.
time it with biru so that at exactly the right point in the music he flings open the door and you go parading through

jess the next time georgia wakes up please whisper "hewwo" very gently at her. i wish to say greetings but also it's early and i don't want to disturb the fine balance between wake and sleep.

i will pay you in gifts sometime in the next year

**Bill** - *2018-06-09*

Yeah they aren‚Äôt like, awake awake.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

that's why it ought to be whispered softly. they should question whether they actually heard it or if it was a dream.

maybe this whole chat is a dream.

**Bill** - *2018-06-09*

Nah, I got up at 8:20.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

biru knows how to con

they should call you biru the conman

**Bill** - *2018-06-09*

The current popular term seems to be Con Dad. (Though Jess says absolutely not Con *Daddy*.)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-09*

Oh she's up now!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-09*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-09*

I'm a lonely soul

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-09*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-06-09*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

Everything is rainy and sweaty so why is the line so long

COSPLAY PARTY

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-10*

COSPLAY PARTY

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

Dedicated to ny‚Äôall



Also there was a SUPER convincing Aizawa cosplayer just wandering around the woman‚Äôs changing room looking lost it was quite funny

are you all hungover. are you feeling the consequences of the alcohol i saw on instagram and you regretting the Drink‚Ñ¢. are you abstinence for life now.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

I'm not! üôå ~~which is kinda surprising~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

jess has received the cosplay kami-sama blessing and is Spared‚Ñ¢

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

How was the rest of your day at Acosta?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

lots o' rain. rose and i managed to grab some rainy pictures in an uncrowded spot right before being kicked out of that spot by staff <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> ~~they didn't have 'no entry' signs up how were we supposed to know we couldn't go there. the boundaries are weird.~~

we ran into a cosplayer we've met before and chatted for a bit. some SUPER WEIRD photographer took our pictures.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Oh no! üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

usually when photogs want our pictures they'll be like "just you" or "just her" or "together" and take a few pictures.
we had a full on chise/saber photoshoot with this guy asking for the most yuri-esque poses.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

üò¨

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

he didn't speak he would like mime it, and at one point he was miming something really complex and I'm like "oh you want us to... do a lap pillow pose?" and he's like "oh you DO understand!! yeah do that." and then continued miming. lap pillow while holding hands and then he gave us two love live dolls and had us make the dolls kiss each other.
we stuck around for the story but after the pictures the dude started getting weird and we left. but he said he'd send us the pics tomorrow <:lenny:395307171539189760>

how was animoonext what went down i saw spilled cereal

any big plans for today

correction: dude was already weird but he was getting weirder. we thought for a minute he was telling rose to lift her skirt but he was telling her to be more confident and wear shorter skirts. which was still mega creepy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Ommggg oh yea! Billy threw cearal at Georgia and it spilled opps

Omg that so creepy! Nooooo

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

I T WAS A RESULT OF VIOLENCE?

i thought it was because half asleep stuffing your face with food HOW DID THIS FIGHT OCCUR

pains was nice though! we met him before. AND DISNEY DUDE he recognized me it was swag i gave him chocolate



are you mystic messing today

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Yea! I wanna get ready but not every one is up and too early to put on a binder!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

whisper "get woke" repeatedly until all are woke

play the mystic mess theme song *really loudly*
"I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGES" as you try to quietly get dressed

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Lmao what a great idea! üòÇ Tom needs to get up so he can help out my tattoo on

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

ooo are you drawing it on or is it on transfer paper?

if it's on paper just kind of lay the sheet over his face

~~me during the call earlier: who are you people. only tom and jess are in cosplay only they are recognizable who are the rest of you.~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

It's temporary tatoo paper.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

*put it on his face*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Oh lmao Dave, Georgia, Hal, and our friends Justin and Rayna

~~omg an Instagram post of mine reached 100 likes in 12 hours wut~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Prop check didn't want to approve my wand yesterday cuz I made it out of a shower curtain rod üò¨ I pinky promised the man I wouldn't whack anyone with it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

wot

ooooooooo metal? is that why

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

Yeeeeeee lol I didn't think about that at all



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

that's a lil harsh. usually they're on the lookout for live steel, small-ish pieces like that tend to be fine but i guess rules are becoming stricter

WOAH KAWAII

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

It so thin

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

yeah that's usually fine! could he tell it was metal by touching it?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-10*

They asked me what it was made of and I am honest ‚Ñ¢

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-10*

das very good. probably why he trusted you. good trust. üëç

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-10*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-11*

Share your wild and crazy animenext stories. Who died.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-11*

I did a dumb and had fun by driving to and from AC everyday before/after work

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-11*

Omg how long did that take

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-11*

i think that decision is probably the craziest thing that happened in my ANext experience 
THO 
I got lifted by a man in high heels because ryan is a fucking beast

Ummmm
So for the 48 hour weekend 
6 hours driving, 19 hours working, 10 hours sleeping.... 13 hours con-ing

give or take 30 minutes in con/driving sections

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-11*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-11*

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I wouldn't say anything, they've already proven they don't want help or advice.

~~just make the facebook event for the shoot this week~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Can also do shoots, like Renora or more Nier.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Still no location in mind for Nier, but Renora we could do easily.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

wouldnt wanna do 2b to the city in the summer

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I meant shoots outside of con for cosplay fix.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

ohhh yea i guess its more con fix then

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

~~But legitimately those eyes are like kicked puppies~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

That just fucks with the pupils, the whole expression is like he's dead inside.

~~I'm such a slut for people complimenting you guys~~

Flora asked what your actual name was Jess, and commented how nice all my friends are. üòä

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

OH YAY ‚ù§ I was super shy and didnt say hi to her üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Also appreciated waving her over to join us mid formal.

<@!288513265661902858> do you care if you admin me on BNE? I could add Dizzy to BNE, and give her a !dab command like lewd.

we can use *all* the dabs.

moot point, qrow looks good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

41 fragments of video footage from the con

nicu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

DAMN

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

lets see if i can get it all down to about 8 minutes of footage, its probably more like 20 right about now

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I did not think you recorded that much.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-11*

Yeah same nani

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

im having trouble syncing up a song i like  tho hm hm

theres like a half second between where one video starts, and when i start speaking

and in that second all you hear is tom saying "fighting games"

and ive had to listen to the audio file like 20 times to perfectly edit it out LOL

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

you can't suppress fighting games.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-11*

Hahahaha omg

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

There's two frames of you and Kirstin(?) of the three burst where you blinked, then she blinked.

Perfectly in sync with my shutter speed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

lmaoooo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-11*

Lmao damn

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

"ren cancels out emotions so he cant feel like" "why did you stick me with him then!"

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

I'm still dying.

*Hisssss faaaaaccceeeeee*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

BILL I LITERALLY JUST SNORTED

It bEGS TO BE MEME'D

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

IT'S SOOOOO GREATTTTTT

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

OMG PLEASE just show them that preview lmao

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

he did it at the group shoot, I remember.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

also should the "nora stole my mans" go in the main vlog or is that a blooper

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

question, what's the difference between bug and panther?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

boob window and latex and tail and whip

theres a deliberate sexualization of panther

if you sexualize the bug suit then youre just a hentai ;3c

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Savvy.

Makes sense.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

tru

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

well, alright, what I meant is latex versus spandex.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

im curbing the chance of being harassed

oh well

like latex they actually use on sex suits

its kinda the same reason id never do fem chat

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

So it's what, a stigma thing?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

sorta

my mom also follows my insta and i dont think id want my mom seeing that kinda content

which means its probably a good judge of not doing it

like my mom doesnt like my pyrrha corset in all honesty but im like LOL I DUN CARE

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Like, I dunno what the difference between the spandex and latex is material wise. Or there not much of a difference, and it's all the Panther sexualizing? (Which I'm all for avoiding, as you recall.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

yeah i mean latex IS less comfy

but my main reasons for avoiding panther are all to do with the sexual nature of the outfit

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

That makes sense ye.

I was just thinking material wise.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

latex is a "sexy fabric" its what bondage suits are made of, and spandex is in like... everything, its not an innately sexy fabric

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Avoid Panther, I hated that part in the game.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

yeah

i mean ann hates the suit too

so id be canon

but id be way too uncomfortable cosplaying that kinda thing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

Latex is shiny and not forgiving spandex is strechy

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

> Girl being pressured into sex with teacher
> Girl threatened with injury to her best friend if not sex the teacher
> Girl *captured in another world by the embodiment of the Teacher's lust*
> Girl fights for her freedom and such in... a catsuit.

The fucking logic to that decision was one of the worst in things in the game.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

yeaaaah

meanwhile everyone else gets nice outfits so like eh

oK i still cant tell is "nora stole my mans" blooper or in the actual vlog

cause its funny as fuck

but idk if its too funny for main vlog

_but its also not a blooper_

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Ye, Joker's outfit is fucking swag. I want his coat.

The vlog is 'your con experience' is it not?

That's part of the experience. Main blog.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

truuu

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

Blooper is technical quirks.

oh yeah, I'm nowhere near it in collection building, but I'm thinking I'll skip 90% of the rwby shoot Georgia.





One of these looks like she's getting hugged by her crush, the other seems like she terrified.

Why.

Nani.



Fuck that great.

<@!351785752197201920> fighting game cosplay meetup at colossal east!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-11*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

i thiiink this vlog is gonna clock in at 8 minutes

nicu

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

That was fast. Here‚Äôs one way to deal with post con depression.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

i just have an audio clip of tom going "brutal"

/yeets it into bloopers

oh no its too smol the music eats it up

well damn bloopers are almost done then

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

You should be able to increase the volume of the clip.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

but its just "brutal" and then next blooper

the pace is more the problem

**Bill** - *2018-06-11*

*brutal.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-11*

7:40-something, not bad

thats a little shorter than most 3 day cons but i barely vlogged saturday

_time to watch for editting errors_

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-12*

One of the sea monkey cosplayers from konkon dented their hotel room wall 
How 
Don‚Äôt do drinks

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

that's the least they did.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-12*

*wot*

I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre getting their hotel deposit back

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

<@!245270932602486784> Yeah, rwby shoot was meh I don't feel like working on it.

I'll grab requiests out of there if you want them.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-12*

Was planning to do it before anext

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-12*

<@!184437198865563648> from RWBY is there any good pics with me that I can use for the vlog thumbnail?

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

You were dead yesterday. I felt meh about Rwby, skipped pulling from it.

Now, miraculous has some neat ones. Like that last shot we did.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-12*

I was dead yesterday I slept 11 hours lmaoooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

oo sleep sounds good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-12*

But now I feel like I'm too well rested and I'm in like an alternate reality

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

did you want rwby specifically or good with miraculous?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-12*

Oo nice

I slept 5 <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-12*

Hmmm preferably RWBY but either or works

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

It's okay I guess ‚Ñ¢

Or this one I suppose.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-12*

i spy a wezrez

looks like she has a long antenna because of the sword

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-12*

Hmmm maybe the first

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

that's it, so...

go ahead.

... huh.

Unless my instagram poll was kinda unclear I was specifically talking about colossal east, *Leneah* is going.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

oh wow i barely remeber her

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

yeeee, naniiiii

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

does she cosplay?

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I tried to keep in touch with her decades ago, like freshman year of college. Didn't stick.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

but she follows you on insta?

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

mhmm.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

whats her handle?

imma creep

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

foxtaildutchie.

Pretty sure Tom is still friends with her on facebook, because he's friends with everyone I've ever introduced him to.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

üëÄ

oh she a furry

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

yeeeeeee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

NOW i remember why i used to mix up her and Leanna

Leanna Malure, Leneah Millar

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-12*

tomato tomato

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

yup. Thought she was cute way back when.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

she was in my shop too right? same year as you?

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

oh hell no, she was a freshman when I was a senior.

But was comm arts.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

ooooo ok so i never even went to school with her ops

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

true!

You'd have hated her too, at the time. üòõ

She likes my stuff on occasion though.

I can't remember if it's the cosplay or actual photos.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

i met her at your house, she was nice, just super quite

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

ye.

Thought she was gay for awhile.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

she is

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

Hung out with all the anime club members that got super gay as soon as I left.

she is? I thought I saw a boyfriend at some point.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

maybe bi?

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

Or I wasn't paying too much attention.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

she has a rainbow symbol on her profile

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

Well, it IS pride month and half her friend group (unless it's changed drastically, but sussex county residents seem to stick together) is LGBT.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

" kinda gay | tbh I think I'm a guy, use Him/his for now I guess "

from tumblr

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

Yeaaaah, that sounds like it.

That was most of the girls from the anime club, for whatever reason.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

ok that was a big ol hole of creeping i fell into

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

can we just low key enforce the name scheme in BNE tho? Admins can force nicknames.

~~There's no way we can avoid bringing Snow back, I thought about it for a hot second~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-12*

What ya mean enforce the name scheme

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-12*

like Jess (whoozica)

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

Yeah.

Namely for new Erik and and Chris.

I doubt they'll care.

I just want BNE to stay a 'real names' server.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-12*

yeahhh

maybe

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

wait, did you bump the permissions Hal? I can see the change nickname option on BNE and Aurii.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-12*

whatya mean

**Bill** - *2018-06-12*

did you admin me?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-12*

oh yeah

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

üòÆ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

YE

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

Easy to get to?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

yea! although i wouldn't recommend going into these building like they did, my cousins foot fell through a floor once

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

*perfect*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

/stomps on the ground

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

the drive is kinda slow cuz old mine road is kinda pot holly but there are multiple locations along it

https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sparta+Township,+New+Jersey+07871/Walpack+Center,+Walpack+Township,+NJ+07826/@41.1831211,-74.8631238,12.75z/data=!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c36d6a5d585495:0x9a86e6858aabbafb!2m2!1d-74.6363588!2d41.0334562!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c361562f87c9e9:0x677e8a5e3f5bb041!2m2!1d-74.8801693!2d41.1589843

thats the trip from sparta to walpack center itself

but id recommend starting on one end of old mine rd and doing the whole thing  ~~too bad fathers day is sunday it would be a perfect time to do it actually~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

~~I just thought of that~~

where's old mine rd?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

rough idea: https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Montague+Grange,+280+River+Rd,+Montague+Township,+NJ+07827/Old+Mine+Rd,+Hardwick,+NJ/@41.1661784,-75.0544957,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c35b58a07c0aab:0xdb796baf885869e8!2m2!1d-74.796768!2d41.300913!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c4839364d28425:0x2a22785eefae83f0!2m2!1d-75.0380971!2d41.03092

it runs the along the delaware river on the NJ side

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

ah I see, it runs into wallpack flatbrook.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

runs through all the land the government repossessed mentioned in the article

yup, which buttermilk falls ispart of i beilive

buttermilk falls is part of stokes state forest so there are public bathrooms semi nearby we could use for changing?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-13*

Cosplay shoot owo?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

im seeing my brother next weekend, hes much more familiar with the area and might know some more hidden spots as well

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

I smell Kuroyuri vibes ye.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

ill talk to him next Saturday for recommendations, him and i did a photo shoot in some of the abandoned buildings in high school

there are some good one literally a mile from my parents house since they live right outside of the gov. land

great places for fallout shoots as alot of the houses were built in the 1700s so they have the same style as the boston houses

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

And that's a third shoot, yikes.

Might as well move in there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

whats the third?

renora, fallout and?

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

Shoot Georgia and I have been planning.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

cosplay?

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

Nah. Glitter.

It‚Äôs... still being ironed out. Glitter apocalypse is the buzz word tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

id be weary cuz of litering

**Bill** - *2018-06-13*

and squatting.

it's one idea, just trying to work on the not 'pretty' shoot ideas.

Princeton is fucking amazing, but looks too put together for some shoots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-13*

childs park is another good waterfall location

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

Think I'll invite Zeikani to chestnut hill. She cosplays RWBY, is a photographer, and seems nice.

If I didn't unfriend Grey the thought crossed my mind to invite her, but fuck it. That was beating a dead horse.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Oh yeah that's good we do need more photographers to go around

I could invite Ben üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

eeeeeeeeh.

üòõ

~~Nobody point out to BNE I'm a huge hypocrite when it comes to self confidence, I demand it of everyone but myself~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*



Did Snow get kicked out of the BNE Katsu room üëÄüëÄüëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

that's snow?

Maybe my theory is right, shit.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

whats the theory?

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

Leanna and Snow are on a break or something.

Just a feeling I have.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

oh that I don't doubt

suddenly cutting yourself off from the world, plus suicide threat

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

Yea I wouldn't doing that

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

really cuts a relationship in half

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-14*

Yeah  I agree

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

<@!351471675843411978> <@!351785752197201920> <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> <@!141729881779077121>  <@!228287793099440128> ? Katsu rooms, everyone is okay with the more expensive Atrium cost correct?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

heck yeah

**Andrew** - *2018-06-14*

sure

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

Cause I need to cancel one pair of the rooms.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

Ye

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

question who is going to otakon

anybody in here

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

no one.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

kk

tis what I thought wanted to make sure

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

Yea that's fine and ya no otakon üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-14*

k.

**Dave** - *2018-06-14*

*is not going to katsu*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

_what about star guardians part 2_

**Dave** - *2018-06-14*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-06-15*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-15*

~~get us the mystic mess autographs~~

**Ienzo (john g)** - *2018-06-15*

idk what mystic mess is.... im going for distant worlds and p5 makotos voice actress

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2017/10/15/con-shortlist.html



oh what the fuck now.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I WAS ABOUT TO POST THAT HERE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

oof

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*



I JUST GOT THIS

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

careful how you act?

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Someone's trying to rope you back in.

Probably because Snow said something.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*



**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

*sonofabitch*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

omggggg

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*





**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

ah yes, the fucking cosplay justice league out to save the day from bullying by doing more of it.

Some asshats with a friend with a bunch of followers think they rule the world because of it, thinking they can judge someone they don't even know via social fucking media.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

even if you try to stay nuetral and take no sides people still have an issue what BS

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

There's no such thing as neutral, it's *us or them*. It's fucking highschool mean girls bullshit.

I'm legitimately scared for you Georgia. You put way too much stock into your follower count for self esteem purposes, and you love cons for the community. This shitstorm can damage both of those things.

and even if I had a fix, because we're apparently airing out people's shit *across the entire east coast*, I can't do a damn thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

id say just keep neutral being the way you are. insist on being neutral and no comment

honestly i still feel there isnt even enough hard evidence to choose a side if you wanted too

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

That worked before because they were looking for support.

They can spin any bullshit they want if they're trying to force her to one side or the other.

and you *actually* don't know anything about this crap, and that's in a sense another problem. They can make shit up all they want and you can't refute it. Again, wasn't a problem before, but has become so now that *we're on a fucking witchhunt.*

Nor can you defuse things with knowledge you have.

You need understanding of a situation to figure out the best way to defuse people. Whose doing the rallying, what they're looking for, what placates them.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

theres literally nothing you can do besides claim ignorance (which isnt a lie) and refuse to get involved

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

and that *pisses me off*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

thats drama for you

even when you do everything to stay out of it someone pulls you in

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Thankfully Nathaniel is on my "neutral" side

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

if it was local drama, I can *do* something. I was able to curb Ethan right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Hes saying exactly what I would want to say which is "I'm against bullying in any form, but I'm not informed enough on the situation so I'm neutral"

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

but this is in FUCKING VIRGINIA, which has nothing to do with us.

He's a good egg.

I can't even say pull out of RTX like I did before; that can be taken as running away due to guilty.

If I hadn't already punched a tree today I'd punch another.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

pulling out of rtx was never going to happen anyway

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I think I'll be alright

My stance can't really be argued for now

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Shouldn't have to, but Snow shot it in the foot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Well no ones gonna say "get involved without knowing anything" cause that's unfair

So for now I'm safe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

just keep doing you. idk what he means by watch the way you act

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

It means the cosplay justice league is off trying to judge Georgia based on her social media.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

So: don't post RWBY from zenkaikon

Just to be safe

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Decent idea.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yea basically

GUESS YOULL JUST HAVE TO POST JNPR

JNPR is safe, you can trust us ‚ù§

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Not that the asshole brigade deserves to dictate your content.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Oh no we have to take more JNPR pics üíõüíñ‚ù§Ô∏èüíö

What a tragedy

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

maybe I'll punch a tree anyway.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

but that hurts

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Then you'll hurt your CAMERA HANDS

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

yeah well this shit's pissing me off on two aspects, I don't even care.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*



**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

No shit it's Jake.

Bless nathenial.

He lacks a kofi.

He's apparently disappointed Snow didn't off herself.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*







**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

üò± üò± üò± üò±

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

right?!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*





**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

do not black out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

NO DRAMA ZONE UGH

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I figured that much out

Black out looks guilty

Posting certain things looks guilty

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Just keep being you and the situation will dissolve

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

That's where I'm at too.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Cuz even if someone asks you something at a convention, you'll just be like, I know nothing about that really

And that's that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

i dont understand why this is all resurfacing again? did snow do something else? or is morning mist and crew bring it all back up? we dont even know enough to form an opinion

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Exactly

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

THANK GOD she is in denver and not going comming this weekend

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

So we're not involved

Yeah lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

cuz that would damn us all

i invited her b4 all this

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

That's why.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

She's not even listed on the invite list anymore

Prob cuz of the account being down

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

She's off to another con, not two weeks after a suicide attempt.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

cuz she deleted her fb

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Yeeet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

oooo thats why its resurfacing?

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

logic would dictate.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

But seriously try not to let it get to you much, just keep being you, everything will work out

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

He's right.

That said, that may bring flak on you. You'll have to harden your heart and keep being the girl we know and love.

How anyone could possibly find you to be a bully like Snow and Mist, I don't know. But it's a risk.

If it comes to that, we need all the facts. Can't mount a defense without them. Knowledge is power and all that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yea but theres no way to garentee those are the facts

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Fair, I more mean knowing everyone's side of the story.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

ooo ok

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I could post a blanket "bully is wrong" thing?

Idk inaction here feels wrong, but so does taking action

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yea i really dont know hun, my instinct is stay quite but....

~~thats always my answer~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Instagram people put value on stories, I see where Nathaniel is coming from.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

stories are for memes, and food pics f dat lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

A blanket story that bullying is wrong would be good cause it shows I'm not ignoring the situation

But doesn't implicate me on either side

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

*what situtation*

Literally nothing knew has happened but Jake and Casey going on a fucking *witchhunt*.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

The situation that either snow or mist are forcing to bring up again lmaoooooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

But then they'll question why you were posting it "randomly" in the first place.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I mean it's a known fact that there's drama going on

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

That you aren't truly privvy to.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

There's a running assumption that I AM though

Which is why ignoring it looks bad

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

and you *don't* want to encourage that.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

They're gonna assume it anyways though

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

You can't play ball without knowing the facts. Staying neutral is important for your moral quality of life. (Spitting on Mist AND Snow, well)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

why do they both have weather names ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Cause they're both horrible human beings.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

change your name to sunnywezrez cuz you gonna clear up all dis bad weather

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

WHy do you need a fucking PR team for a instagram accoutn.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

SUNNYREZ

IT ME

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

"hello yes? no im sorry wezrez isnt making statement on this right now"

"i can take a message and express your concerns to her"

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

"also watch out for the gum you accidentially just sat in"

If you want to get a little personal, high school graduations are coming up. You say 'to all the kids who were bullied in HS, I was too. Then I entered the cosplay community, and found out how wonderful a place it is. bullying is wrong, look forward to your futures'.

Which still feels fake as hell to me, but I'm a pessamist.

It's not topical, it shows your stance, and seems a little more coincidental.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

that's a good idea

It's very generic

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I'm not a PR guy though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

~~I wasn't bullied in high school I was just an outcast it's different but that's ok~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

phrase it so you aren't lying then. Never want to get caught in a lie.

If we had the *facts*, I lean towards stating 'I am not involved, I do not want to be involved, I do not know mist or snow well enough to make judgements, I do not make judgements off social media and hearsay, and I do not participate in witchhunts.'.

But to play ball you need to be confident you can back your stance.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Plus that offends everyone involved

As much as Nathaniel doesn't think so, I do sorta have a reputation?

I'm not in the cosplay community to make enemies

I almost ALMOST wanna ask someone FOR the details but that's a bad move

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

you have a brand reputation, yes.

I know the feeling. But Tom was right, keeping doing you and it may blow over.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

ALSO I'm mad at Snow cause it was HER who dragged me into this by namedropping

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

fuck Snow.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Oh yeah same

And you only saw a piece of it too

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I'm offending everyone because fuck em all. They're all terrible people to get bystanders involved like this.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

We're at super disliking her and ignoring her existence

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Like I definitively know Snow dragged me into this

That is a FACT

So I can stand by that and be mad at that

If she hadn't name dropped me in an attempt to be associated with nice people, I wouldn't be in this mess

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Yet we'll shit on our BNE relationship if we do go against Snow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Mostly Jaime and Heather tho it sounds like

A lot of people are playing neutral

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Rebecca too.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

And Leanna and Snow.... ehhhh

Yeah Rebecca seems a little less committed than those two

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Mark will probably be bothered by it. Mostly because suicide is serious and he's a dad.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

But also Snow dragging bystanders in isn't, like, okay either??

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I don't want to shit on BNE personally, but I'm definitely done with Snow.

Yup.

All of them. Shit.

Casey, Jake, Snow, Mist.

keep your drama in fucking virginia.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

It's one of those situations where people are trying to create drama from nothing. And like... I'm so turned off tonthise situations even if I'm involved. My bother and his wife were the same way.

Regaurdless it'll blow over.

It'll stay blown over as long as snow or mist dont do something dumb like reopen it repeatedly. Which if they do... I'll do what I have to to cut them out of my life.

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I'd do it now, if I could.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

(I'm not the one in the situation so it's all theoretical)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah it's just messy

I'll see what info Nathaniel gets from today

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Tom's right. wait for it to blow over, we'll react accordingly as things evolve, and just be you. fuck their opinions.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

He seems to be on Team Neutral at least cries

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I just want to call out jake on trying to witch hunt,.

I can't, both because it would reflect on you Georgia as well as I have no credablity in this field.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I thought he was such a nice person too

Isn't he like 30 also you'd think he's past this kinda stuff

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

High road.

That's the strategy now.

Maybe mister hero can learn from you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Is it worth asking Hunter about what contexts I'm being brought up in?

He's in the Casey camp but he's always had a soft spot for me as a fellow Woodbridge-area RWBY

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

no one ever past it

i know 60 yearolds who start drama

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

Plus Jake prob is a nice guy who thinks he's doing the right thing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yup

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Do not Georgia.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Plus he didn't say anything directly again her

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Hold off, see what happens, make sure Natheniel knows to keep you in the loop.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Seriously ignore it, it's the best thing to do,don't get involved for the want to know what's being said about you

It's not worth knowing

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

üëÜ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

I know you really wanna know but

If people are saying anything it has no backing and they know that, so the rumors will die when people meet and talk to you.

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Consider it a tactical maneuver to not show interest.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

And that's that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Oof fuck this situation

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

YEET

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

And the internet as whole doesn't matter, don't forget that. You have your friends, your boyfriend, and your family.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeaaaaah

Dang Snow getting me involved

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

And this is why BNE isn't close friends.

You're getting a big damn hug tomorrow, so you know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

üíï

Alright time to find some JNPR to post today

Oh wait I posTED IT ALL cries

I have other non Snow pics tho it's okay

There's thankfully a lot of un-involved people I have pics with

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

~~post selfies of me and you~~ jk dont do that

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

ditto tho. We all post selfies with Georgia.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

doenst that just get more people involved?

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

~~Not for that, I just want to post selfies with my buddy~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

mmhmm sure XD

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

why would I want to get you involved <@&455787357426417674> ?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

#teamwezrez

STAHHPP üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Lmaoo

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

* #teamwiserice

This too shall pass.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

*throws rice at people* DONT BE DRAMA

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

YEA

now we are talking

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

10/10 ign.

Better than Fallout 76.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

~~thats not hard to do though~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

*throws rice* begone THOT

Ugh I wanted to do a "RTX round up" for all the events at RTX so people know

But NOW that seems like I'm TAKING sIdES

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I'm not actually sure how with that one.

But write RTX off as a vacation with Hal and Hal alone.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

arent you running event though?

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Everywhere else will be a minefield.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah I'm running the RWBY group shoots

Which is why I'm in this mess

Cause snow was like YOU CANT GET ME, GEORGIAS MY FRIEND

and they're like georgia...... we know that name.......

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

üò¶

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

_if Snow had kept their stupid mouth shut_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yea so you cant really avoid the events youve already taken on

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

I wonder what Mist or Snow is doing to re-open the wounds on this

Frankly if I believe anything, it's that Snow was the liar, and dragged me into this mess

Cause she name dropped me all the way back at Katsu time

And then did it AGAIN now

And I got lucky last time that David caught it and fixed it, and Nathaniel caught it this time and is trying to help fix it

But this can't keep happening

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

indeed. I wouldn't recommend burning a bridge until you have information though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

I'm neutral

But personally I would say that I lean away from Snow

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

We all do.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Not necessarily towards the Mist side but frankly Snow has caused way more trouble than she's worth

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

I'd stay third party, "against" both.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I feel like Casey's group would be placated with knowing I'm not on snows side

But

Neutrality for now

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Stay neutral.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Until it blows over or I get some information or what

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-15*

Christ this is a mess

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

However, if David has screen caps of Snow talking shit about you too, that's valuable.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah good point

I'll go see if I can find those

At least for receipts

Boom got da receipts screenshotted

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

what do you mean by dat tho?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Just screenshotting proof that snow caused beef earlier in the year

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Directly? Or David telling you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

David telling me

I mean that's all I have

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Only thing better would be if Mist sent David screen shots.

But you'd have to ask.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

She didn't nah

Yeah

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

And David would go in guns blazing for you, but that's not helpful right now.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Just good to gather info for now

To have it if I need it

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

exactly.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

**oof everything points to snow being the villian**

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

~~we knew that though~~

~~we were just willing to let by gones be by gones unlike some asshats~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

<@351471675843411978> I JUST REALIZEDD SNOW REMINDS ME OF MARY ABORT ABORT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

Welp she do share a name with the most evil substance know to man

YEP

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

That's *good news* though.

*Maybe she'll run off to fuck all mid west with someone and not come back for 5 years*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

T~~oo bad Mary wasn't gay too. Then she wouldn't have dated my brother~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

*PERFECT I ship it*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

You mean married your brother

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I screenshotted the DMs with angryjigglypuff though

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

dated, married, same thing. Right Tom and-his-girlfriend-Jess.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Though she just posted this



**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

*Oh for fucks sake*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

Ommgggg are you fucking kidding me

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Who's that

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

Member of the mist defense squad

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

It's unrelated anyways cuz both are claiming they were bullied

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

Passive aggressive bullshit

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

And we don't have facts so

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

Yup exactly know the truth

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Which explains why Nathaniel said this



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Yeah

Pffft

Ignore it all <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Oh huh

Ya know that means David was involved in the drama with Snow and Mist

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

What happened to the "Suicide is serious, everything is in the past, I'm so sad" bullshit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*



So in the end David took mists side for a reason

Interesting to note üëÄ

Oooooh mangoloo got added to nathaniels RTX photoshoot planning discord

That means they must be talking now

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

Assuming Jigglypuff is backing the wtich hunt, they want you to decry Snow from the photoshoot so 'you're not welcome in the community anymore' is a real threat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

You mean Snow? And yeah maybe..

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

yeah, SNow.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-15*

Duck that 
They said they'd be willing to make amends and help her get over herself 
, you can't say that while also trying to enforce a community shut out 
Plus like 
Outbullying somebody doesn't solve anything, if anything it proves snows point

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yea you cant fight fire with fire and expect by standers to support you

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

They're~all~ass~holes~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-15*

Yeeeeeeeet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

I mean yeah they're hypocrites

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-15*

yea

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

But (this may sound selfish) they're not personally harming me

I'm more mad that Snow has tried to drag me into business that isn't mine

T W I C E

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

You don't have the facts. It's hard to care based on thirty angry people's words.

No one is rational or logical, the actual truth doesn't matter as long as someone gets hurt.

Look, Listen, and Think for yourself.

Never make a public declaration against someone based on one person's opinion.

The passive aggressive shit is getting old too.

If they want you to do something, fucking say it.

You're all in Nathaniels discord together. They know how to reach you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-15*

Thankfully nathaniel and hal are in that discord yeah

**Bill** - *2018-06-15*

instagram right now.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-18*

let us hope that the rain discourages all my students from coming tonight so i can just sit around and not work for 7 hours üôè

but also Dizzy (not desii dizzy but my boss dizzy) said that I can return to my zenkai staff position at any time without re-applying all over again üò≠ too pure. Talks are in the works to also potentially tape a livestream of my face onto a dakimakura  so I can be on the lookout for oversized and dangerous props near prop check at the con. <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-18*

<:lenny:395307171539189760> <:lenny:395307171539189760>

That's great tho <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-18*

also learned some very interesting intel on the ball for next year. very interesting indeed.

the wrap-up meeting should be next week finally so if there's room info i'll learn it then

i can't share the formal ball info until it's announced but semi-related is that they're trying to make it increasingly formal, so attire that seems semi-casual and was allowed in for previous years likely won't be allowed in the future unless it follows the attire guidelines

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-18*

Yeah it was pretty damn formal this year so <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-18*

orly? then maybe they already made the dress code change and i misunderstood. or they gonna get stricter. that was the #1 complaint in the past tho, not formal enough

**Bill** - *2018-06-18*

Tanks for the spoilers. Everyone promises not to leak stuff.

Con people, don't forget to watch for Next room block announcements as well.

Everyone isn‚Äôt free June 14th, for some reason your coming to my parents anniversary. Or any other excuse to not go with 30 miles of Snow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-18*

whaaats going on then

**Bill** - *2018-06-18*

Snows birthday. She invited BNE.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-18*

oh i dont see that in chat

oops i work anyways lol

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-18*

I work that weekend probably

**Bill** - *2018-06-18*

It‚Äôs an excuse to begin with.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-19*

You mean July <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-06-19*

You right. Same thing applies.



*Down with RTX*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-19*

Joe said he's 100% cool with doing whatever with us for collosal

**Bill** - *2018-06-19*

yeet. Asking Ashley? I know that's not absolute cheapest solution but I'd like to help them out if possible.

Snow has a new Facebook.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-19*

**Bill** - *2018-06-19*

Jenna Lyn.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-19*

yep it is

**Bill** - *2018-06-19*

I'm not planning on responding.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-19*

I have work anyways üòè

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-19*

I added her back cause FB doesn't matter

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-19*

Yeah i added her back too

She only has like 8 people invited to her party huh

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*



Is that more info than I neeeeed?

I feel like I'm over doing it cause she started that friday shoot.

and I don't want to lie and say it is the main gathering.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

this one is saturday tho right?

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*

ye. The other one has no engagement, not worth the effort on her part.

Or do I just be like "ye!".

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

nah i think your explaination is good

**Bill** - *2018-06-20*



If anyone else requested age 13-18 it would be super sketch lol.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-20*

Well yea üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-20*

who wants to go on a cruise with camerasssss

for like, 175 bucks.

<@!288513265661902858> So I can't get the Sheraton to remove the charge for your car unless I have a receipt showing you paid elsewhere. If you have that, I'd appreciate it.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-25*

haha
ha
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2009-07-02/floatacon/the-first-anime-convention-on-a-cruise-ship

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

<@!301927856240459777> I'm sure you know what up

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

Bill

They cant have charged for my car

If they're charging a third car it's completely unrelated 
Because I never talked to Sheraton, parked with Sheraton or anything

Saying they charged for my car is like saying they charged for Marisas car

I also dont have the tickets, the machine takes them when you leave

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

I know the parking charges are in excess, but unless I show that you parked elsewhere via some kind of record that you paid a different parking lot for friday and saturday night, they can't remove the charges.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

Ok but 
Why do you need to show that somebody who isn't in the room
Didnt park with the room

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

because I could also say we had one car. There's a level of trust involved with this Hal. They are justified to not want to remove charges because I said they're wrong, because I have everything to gain.

If you don't have a record, that's fine. It's twenty bucks or so.

I'm just asking in case.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

I dont have a record the machine at the convention center takes the ticket

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

Then that's that. (Though it won't matter in this scenario, that IS the hotel parking lot.)

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-25*

It isn't 
They're separate

They have different lots with different machines

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

I'm only saying hotel parking is down there as well.

The level of effort required to get the charges removed at this point isn't worth the money back, they already removed the phantom car we didn't have and the thursday night stay from 'your' car.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Ya know I'm a "plan in advance person"

But is it bad I have 0 interest in planning Katsu right now as far as groups go?

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

it's because it's Katsu.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Like cheerleader RWBY sounds fun but I don't wanna commit like that

Cause... it's stupid busy? üòú

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

pretty much. Both of us have sour points for Katsu.

bet you also would rather be organizing the group too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Maybe a little bit

I also have little interest in cheerleader RWBY

I'm not super crazy about all mojojojs designs

I mean I'm not doing bunny Pyrrha for RTX

Or this cheerleader one for Katsu

Swimsuits I would do but that's also pretty generic

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

yeah.

Only other one I can think of is china dress.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

I also had spitballed my own line up for Katsu and it only devotes half a day to RWBY

I might wanna do Fallout or Borderlands or League or Nier

~~wow I really play more video games than watch anime huh~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

yup.

do keep in mind volume 6 is going to come out and we're all probably going to hype the hell out rwby again.

and by we I mean mostly me, because stockholm syndrome.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-25*

Yeah I imagine my Katsu is like half a Friday RWBY (cause the turn out at RWBY shoots is better that day anyways), half a day something else, half a day league, half a day something else, and maybe persona on Sunday

That's what I've been kicking around (and I've only thought of it because I need to plan expenses)

I think Fallout hype will be up again so I may do that

But also I still have yet to play Nier üòè

So yeah idk Katsu is too far away for me to commit and I feel weird cause a lot of others are doing it lol

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

Cheer outfits are probably too simple for you anyway.

You like things with complexity, since you enjoy the process of making them, or at least with complicated components like Lux staff.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

i feel like its early to commit too

i feel like the group will fall apart but that time

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

The only mojojoj that's complicated sounds like china dresses.

*truth*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

i mean cheer Nora is cute and i like that her design is different than the beacon ones but yea idk wanna commit to that

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

Dups are allowed, so no need to. You can probably slide in late if you want to join up.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-25*

true, honesty i cheer outfit looks easy af even for me

**Bill** - *2018-06-25*

yeet.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-06-26*

Tanacon not as bad as dashcon but info is still coming out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Kirsten is looking for roomies for Colossal too

Why so many people deciding on Colossal east so last minute

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

They haven't been yet.

Meg, definitely taking advantage of a market made up of Gen.



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I saw that

I'm thinking she's gonna open commissions

Cause people have messaged me about leg armor and circlets

**Bill** - *2018-06-26*

You barely have time for your own stuff, and I‚Äôm sure Meg is the same. I have no idea how active cosplayers do commissions.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

I did one once

I made a Pidge hoodie

Someone asked ME

I didn't even do commissions

I did it on a whim tho and I made 40 bucks and learned how to sew a Pidge hoodie lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

Whoa

Nice

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

And I still have extra Pidge fabric lmao so

If anyone is thinking of Pidge-ing any time soon

Plz buy my fabric off me it is soft

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

Pidge would be my second choice for a voltron cosplay

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-26*

Lotor is the first? Right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-26*

Yeet

**Bill** - *2018-06-27*

Nier shoot: all sorts of photos of frolicking in the water like some moe anime, but everyone is straight faced except Nines.

üòëüåä

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-27*

im here for it already

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-27*

üôå

**Bill** - *2018-06-27*

<@!351471675843411978> can you hop on a call for 10 minutes? I'm going to make you pick the published ones from Angel beats, I've only got a few to develop left.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-27*

**Bill** - *2018-06-27*

kk, going to mini aurii.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

pocono kalahari is expanding the convention center

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-28*

WOOOO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

nah it gonna take 18 month to finish

they broke ground today

there adding a ballroom

formal for CCE 2019? üòÇ

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-28*

Ooo nice!

Still awesome

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I doubt colossal will add a formal.

I don't think OG CE has one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

i dont think a formal at nakedcon would go over well

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Ah yes, nothing like slow dancing, slowly getting closer together, ditching the hover hand for actually touching her, until your dancing bathing suit to bathing suit.

It's wet, kinda sticky, and really fucking cold.

How beautiful an image.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

wow sounds like fun

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

~~not supposed to~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

~~sarcasm~~

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I'm sure moist pigeon would love it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

lmao

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

<@!245270932602486784>

üëÄ

nah, wait, fuck it. Gotta be in the wata paaak at all times.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

depending on time maybe id hit it up, im gonna pack pj nora and ren for like all overngiht con

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-28*

I think I should ditch the first Ren wig

And just pony tail the better one

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

up to u bb

for the water park too thou?

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Kirsten is going to be there friday night, and if it's like last year friday night is late swim.

Late swim is 100% worth doing over pajamas.

If it was *saturday* sure, but not friday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

oh yea late swim is lit but bits not till like 10

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

good point...

nevermind she going to be there saturday too.

resume üëÄ for pajama party.

Kirsten wants to make the PJ party but doesn't know locations.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

Did she just post that?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

map of the con center should be on the kalahari site

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

YEET

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

She hasn't been, that's why she didn't.

She told me in DM, DM'd about the late swim.

I'm not sure where a PJ party would fit tho...

I suppose main lobby?

can always meet there and move too, tbh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

yea i guess main loby or maybe tentacle tree

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Tentacle tree lacks space to setup tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

hallway next to top of tentacle tree? like on the second floor where the elevatorr are?

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

maybe.



Do I just tell her she'll have 5 people already, or what.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

YE!

saturday night?

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I thought about volunteering, but I don't want to lock in my evening to it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

ill promo the event on my story too

yeeeah

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

yea i dont wat like any obligations for CCE

not that i ussually have any

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

~~except da pool, the pool can always have my time~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

YE!

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

yeah, late swim is a need.

and if Saturday doesn't have late swim again, maybe Meg and them are going to close one of de bars like Meg and Lissy did at Next. üëÄ

I'd love to chill at the bar.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

pool bar? or regular bar? well i think water park closes at 9 so i guess that answers tht

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

*we* closing hot tub bars friday night.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

YEET

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

Kirsten wants to do both nights and I don't want to discourage her but probably not worth it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

tell her she would get better turnout isolating it to saturday night cause friday has late night swim

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

who is this girl anyway?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

you gotta be realistic anyways

shes the neo/ladybug i was hangin with at anext a bit with bill

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

ohhh ok!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-28*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-28*

**Bill** - *2018-06-28*

I didn't work out, I just like em.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

One of my mutuals made matching aprons for his datemate and him

~~ignoring the fact that Pyrrha and Ren doesn't make sense to me~~ they're really cute



HIS GIRLFRIEND IS LIKE 6 FOOT ALSO like wow canon my woman

I met her as Yang and I was like holy



She wasn't even in tall heels but damn she tall

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

I KNOW I'm so confused by Ren and Pyrrha I really am

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

ren and anyone except nora makes me sad

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-06-29*

ooo but they cute

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

Ren and Jaune I get the brotp

But I don't even think Ren and Pyrrha talk directly at each other üòÇ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

i think ive seen art of with nora and hers said what they have for pyrrha

yea i feel like they dont idk man i can get behind J+R or N+P or just JNPR as one big relationship but not P+R or N+J

especially if nora ends up by herself cuz she obv. loves ren and thats just sad

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-29*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-29*

He was 100% drunk when he posted that

Drunk Tyler is shit at hiding his feelings lol

He gets mushy

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

I really hope CCE will involve lots of people. Like, I just want to hang (and drink, lots of that too) with all the people I'm usually busy shooting,.

Like, Erik, Richard, Meg, etc.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

it should

**Bill** - *2018-06-29*

Or maybe we'll all end up at a room party.

Dunno how that happened still.

but fuck the fate people so.

Nier Jen is coming to CCE shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-29*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-30*

Beach weekend when

Ugh I wanna stay in ocean front hotel with a hot tub

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-30*

None of those people are from Delaware

Some of them are from New Jersey

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

I've been calling them Delaware squad for months boi.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-30*

Welp

Guess you were wrongo

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-30*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-30*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-30*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-30*

They were visiting meg for that

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

I thought about using that, but how does that roll off the tongue?

I used to think that, but I don't want to alienate them in my head.

They cool.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-30*

I didn't say they weren't cool lol I'm saying they *are* cool

**Bill** - *2018-06-30*

I hope to, tbh.



THERE IS NO WAY THIS COULD GO WRONG

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-06-30*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-04*

I heard there was a shooting threatened for anime expo üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-04*

Anime expo has insanely strong security but anything could still happen üôÄ

Last time I went they closed half the convention center because someone lost their bag and it was treated as a bomb threat

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-05*

they're furries now
i have some bird whistles that furries use as squeakers tell them they'll need those

"Swords: @sayuncleqrow" <- Ye fuck Ethan.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-05*

is it normal to list where wigs and stuff were all bought

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

yea some people do it

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I'd say it's uncommon. Not rare, but not common either.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

mine would be like:
Wig: some cheap Chinese shit from amazon
Hammer: A buttload of foam floormats and wood from home depot
Costume: Some more shit from amazon and a jacket made from a pokemon go trainer pattern

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

The two reason I see most are 1. so people won't ask you 'where'd you get that wig', and 2. the site is active on instagram so they might get reposted or mentioned or something.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-05*

YEAH
wig from chinese ebay
for the costume name each and every type of fabric from the scrap bin at jo-ann's

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

yea! lmao sept all my fabris is from amazon too

my nora jacket is this really cool stretch demin stuff

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-05*

ooo really? i've never bought fabric from amazon i never thought of that. is it usually good? walmart sucks never buy from them.
i might start ordering from aliexpress because the fabric is more... costume quality? kind of? like. i've bought doll fabric from it before and it's a lot more doll-like and cheaper than what jo-anns has. the cotton is stiffer too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

ive only bought that and broadcloth but the broadcloth was same as joanns broadcloth

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Need to signal boost colossal nier via instagram. For the explicit purpose so chibidude sees it.

oh, and kamistry.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-05*

omg lady whoozica is gonna be at the nier shoot?? really?? can u get her autograph

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I'll try, but I hear it's hard to do.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

Yeah, I mean, just story post that it exists,or regular post

Either way I'm sure it'll get some attention

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

:3c I'm on it

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

thats what he was looking for

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

I mean, I was doing it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

yea but thats why u sais it here

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

Me and Jess actually prob have a decent chunk of nier followers

We should prob do ittoo

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Nope, because I want you and Tom to share it too, since ^

You hung with everyone, I was taking pictures. Coming from you guys its more friendly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

hmmm okey dokey

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

Still not sure if I should do nines or Adam or both üò≠ üò≠ üò≠

I wanna be nines to match Jess ofc

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

custome change half way through photoshoot

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

But also Adam cuz he's not done a lot

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

You can probably share my story if you want to be lazy, or make your own.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

Mmkay

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Plenty of memeable imagery to make it fun from the shoot gallery.

~~Like Tom butt~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

GLORY TO MANKIND

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

yeeee boi

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

OMG

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*I was wondering that too*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

Battery saver

Realized I was at half this morning

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

all that pokemon go huh.

You can't charge it at work?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-05*

I can

Didn't have the charger

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Here's pre signal boost, lets see if we get more. ~~Probably won't from me sharing it, but you guys...!~~

Ah, I have a phone dock at work just for work.

<@!245270932602486784> do event polls always let you add answers? I'd start the 'who are you cosing' poll but I don't see the option to ensure people can add answers.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

I think by default it does yeah

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Go check. ~~and someone put down a character so it's not empty~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

theres no option to add anything üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

RIP

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

id say add atleast a few main characters and then add an option should be there

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

The option to enable it doesn't show up for some reason.

I'll just do a google survey.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Did you do it on computer?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

i think its just handling it like that cuz the there are no options at all if you have at least 2 then the option should be there

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

Yeeee

I always added RWBY/JNPR and then it gave the option to add more

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Nope, mobile doesn't work any better.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

OOP yeah I can't add A2 oh no guess I'll have to be 9Breasts

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

hmm still not there

what the heck

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

I would just put as many options as possible then

2B, 9S, A2, Adam, Eve, Uhhh??

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

devola, polola (sp?)

robots? hehe

emil?

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Or just do spreadsheet?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

eh in my experience if people have to take an extra step like click a link its going to get less response

doesnt mean you cant do it

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

fuck it, if we miss someone's character they can comment it in.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

ye

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

~~Need to make a call list too~~

My work ethic has *tanked* this week.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

Done.

https://petapixel.com/2018/07/05/10-tips-for-taking-your-vlogging-to-the-next-level/ <@!245270932602486784> apparently photographer vlog focused, but concepts may apply.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-05*

**Bill** - *2018-07-05*

*exactly what it says on the tin*

**Dave** - *2018-07-06*

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

NYCC? Nah, too crowded.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

You need to have submitted your evaluation for it like forever ago I think

My coworker reminded me of the last day for submissions like 10 years ago lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-06*

If you‚Äôve gone before you have until Sunday I think. They keep sending out emails

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

They evaluate you?

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

no fake nerd girls allowed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Lmao

**Dave** - *2018-07-06*

shit, i wont be allowed then

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-06*

You have to fill out like a pre pre registration

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

What even is this? Like what do they ask you? Wtfff

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

It's to prevent scalpers

So I guess I get jt

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

and heather is the first person to ask about colossal east shoots!

*For shame, Georgia!* üòõ

I ain't booking anything though. My schedule is fuck around with camera until group shoot, group shoot, then swim and drink.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

what was she askin for?

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

She didn't say.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

üòÆ

i thoughT IT WAS IMPLIED

when we all went "watah ~~flowah~~ fall?"

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

~~girl I live for your over eager enthusiasm with these shoots~~ Tru it was.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

p h e w

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

But anyway, ye. Like, if we bump into her in the morning, heck, yeah, I'll photo.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

oh yea i was thinking the same thing

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Or if I decide to keep the camera a little later, or we shoot the shit after rwby.

what same thing?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

the implied waterfall thing

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Oh yea, I basically pointed out what we should shoot this time around.

Given swimsuits, photos are kinda back burner? Is that it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

yeee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

~~swimsuit photos get mad likes~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Not exactly, but we're keeping it personal.

~~and dick pics~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

i mean as long as i have nier and jnpr covered thats good

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

üò≠

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

id prob like hak and yona photos but i gotta see with hal bout that

omg

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

we could always snap phone pics too if billy is busy or doesnt have camera

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

yeet!

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

They're doing Hak/Yona sunday, odds are I'll have camera.

and also I *just* said I'm staying *not* busy this con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

im laying out a text book and the chapter im on keeps talking about "electromagnetic waves" <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

_i was worried you were offended i hadnt asked explicitly yet_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

what i mean is if you dont wanna take pics

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

what, about Hak Yona?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

:3c

CCE do you mean electromagnetic waves

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

YEA

thats what i think everytime i read it

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

What I meant before is I dig your enthusiasm cause I thrive off it. Gets me more motivated.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

_im very enthusiastic about the waterfall yes_

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

So when you JNPR WOOO I'm more excited for it, etc.

One of the reasons I really enjoy shoots with you, honestly.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i mean i kinda think thats the only reason tom wants to bring full ren at all?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Full JNPR tho...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

sometimes enthusiasm isnt so WHOOO its more subtle

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Should do like... Hiking!JNPR.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

~~plus i never wanna bother you~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

^^^

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I appreciate your subtle enthusiasm as well Jess. I know you, I got you covered.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

oh ok, yea cuz i cant still be really camera shy even though i dont wanna be

like i want pics but i feel awkward getting them taken XD

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

You've gotten much less awkward with photos recently.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

i mostly wanna square away jnpr and nier and everything else is like.......... if it happens it happens

WOO IMPROVEMENT

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Next was a *world* different for you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

üëè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

practice helps hehe

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

You've got confidence being 2B, it shows.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

ye!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

~~i dont think i make a great 2b tho~~ but yea i guess i do

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

And Lilith actually, you could tell at Zenkai.

YOU ARE BEEEEEEEAUTIFULLLLLLLL IN EVERRRRRRRY SINNNNNNGLE WAAAAAAY

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

~~i just like being sexy~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

*just imagine my voice cracking*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

dont worry i did

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

^^^

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

sexy is easy lmao as weird as that sounds

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

naaah fam its not for everyone

you just a natural

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

oh thank

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

and Georgia, JNPR and Nier is squared away. from whenever we roll out of the rooms till group shoots we do photos. Waterfall, wave pool, outdoor pool, etc.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

WOOOO

ready 2 get gay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i mean i dont think theres any cosplays i feel unconfident in, i just feel more confident certain days XD

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

mhmm, we all do. I've had days I loved shooting and others where I wanted everyone to die.

My guess is sexy works for you because you are, in your way, sexy. You'd be slower to adjusting to insane, like Nora, because she's further from your own personality.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

‚ú® natural sexy ‚ú®

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

yeet.

*I just told Jess she has sexy in her personality, what a day*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

SHE DO THO

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i suppose so.  I enjoy being Nora though, i think i did her well at katsu

oh thank

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

ye you did! and then you added SEXY HAMMER for MAXIMUM POTENCY

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

We like being different, different isn't bad either. You my favorite Nora.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

all my cosplays are crazy, sexy, or edgy

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

100% true, and I mean Nora as Nora, not Renora.

Standalone Jess Nora is best Nora.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

nah

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

*Where's my oh thank*

*How dare*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

~~thank you~~

i dont think im the best anything tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

<@&455787357426417674> IS THE BEST NORA EVER!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

D:

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Tru, cosplay isn't a competition. But personally, I like you best as Nora.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Gen is my friend too.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

YEA

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

You my favorite because you are, stupid, I don't lie.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

WHAT

did u just call me stupid?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

oh nvm that could be read wrong

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

*if you say stupid things you are stupid~~~*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

he done it nowwwwwwwwwwww

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

oh I see what you read, there should be a comma in there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

i thought you were saying your my fav nora cuz you're stupid

and im like WELP

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Yeah, sorry, need them commas.

And to refute the friend argument, if it was Georgia in Nora I'd still choose you. So there. BEST NORA.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

~~dude i would still choose jess too lol~~

noras got too much energy for me

yang and lux are energetic but its a diff kind of energy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

oh yea nora is hard to do on no coffee yo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

nah noras energy is like enthusiastic energy

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ok tru

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

yang and lux energy is just confident energy

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Yang is like, Sassy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

tho not necessarily inundating

kinda more flirty in a way?

but not quite

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

yo i was so hype to be nora at katsu

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Yeah, she's sexual but not defined by it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

shit now i wanna bring nora to CCE

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

hence Sassy.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

we have canon height differences

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

YEAH!

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

~~She said Pyrrha not Georgia~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

really tho pyrrhas a struggle, i understand why theres so few

gens struggling with armor, rebeccas remaking almost all of hers

meg is on her like, 7th remake of armor

idk if shes completely happy yet

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

And Meg didn't make everything herself, she bought the corset...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

also true

she told me she cant sew and doesnt really wanna make that part of her repertoire

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I feel like she's your type, with the have to make it all herself thing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

mines like a stiff cardboard nightmare

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

GURL NO IT DONT those bobbies are squeezed in

i had to like shove them in and button lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

but they still look good

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

o thank

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Did indeed. But Jess meant shaping, not actual size.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

my squished bobbies appreciate knowing that they suffered for beauty

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

hiyori i have to cram them in and they look all flat and nasty

like almost as flat as my binder XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

ye remakes are understandable if you dont feel good in it

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

she bought Hiyori tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ye and i found a pattern so it should be easy

ok so its not a re-make

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

re nakked?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

its a make

shh you

i can sew as long as i have a pattern, no pattern im still leary of but tom did it for leo so i could proob fogure it out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

it works better for some things than others

i can sew a sweater sans pattern but forget doing a corset patternless

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ugu i wanna con before CCE RIP

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ooo what day? how much $$?

ill just google it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

its 18-19 i believe

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

three day.

Ryan said expense for what it had there, but con + times square. Basically Kinda but in NYC.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

55 for just saturday

oof

60 for full weekend, but we prob wouldnt stay right?

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I mean, probabty expensive but NYC at night would be cool.

Plus 2 hour train rides back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

ouch

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ya i wouldnt wanna take friday off tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Nah, me either.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

ooo idk theres pros and cons LOL CONS

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

If you had the time to make it or the money to buy it, would you redo Yurippe Georgia?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

apparently there is some small con in morristown this weekend? or maybe it was last?

cuz my friend was like "wait what you're not going?" and i was like "huh?"

ooo its garden state comic fest

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

prob not

the cost isnt worth re-wearing it maybe one or two more times

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

thats like comic centered thou so that would explain why i didnt care about it

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

thats prob at the old anext con center

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

nah old a next concenter is shut down

its at the William G. Mennen Sports Arena

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Except that Angel Beats needs love tho.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

but she already has it and it looks fine so why remake it?

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

She did just say it was really tight on her right?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

yea but it looks fine so id think its worth dealing with over remaking

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

as we've learned with Pyrrha, being comfortable is part of a good cosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

its mostly shoes thou

like thats the big comfort stealer anything else is deal-able to me atleast

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

remake, throw money at, same difference right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

yeah my level of care for angel beats is kinda waning

ill always appreciate the anime but cosplaying it is another story

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Or completely waned, as far as cosplay goes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

yeaaaah

the cosplay is worth squeezing another wear or two, if only to cosplay with buddies

but im not attached to the cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

yeah...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

i mean ive had it for three years ya know

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Would make a poor birthday present then lol.

back to the drawing board. ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

you got the weezer tickets tho!

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

That was Christmas tho?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

it was?

i never keep straight when i get gifts i just remember who got them lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

lol yeah. I bought them in the terminal to go to Canada for the christmas party.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

GOOD LUCK DEN

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

LOL

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

tho i dont think im a horrible person to gift shop for

like my dad, doesnt need or want anything, total minimalist

at the end of the day, fallout and space are all good thematic gifts for da georgia

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Eh. I'm with Tom, I don't like gifts for specific reasons.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

biru and tom are hard to shop for

they just buy things when they want them so by the time you know hey wanted it its allready been bought

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I get gifts cause I decide to. Hence edible arrangements on Tom and Jess's dating anniversary.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

YEEEY

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

pfft yeah okay, that's me.

if it helps, I suffer the same thing trying to get my Dad gifts.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

but thats still for an occasion

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

But it's not 'a birthday gift'.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

just for onr im not supposed to celebrate anymore

but i do anyway cuz i can HA

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Like, the expectation kinda ruins it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

I understand how you're that way, you surprised me with the space playing cards and space pen before and I was like WHOAOAOA

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I'll see something and be like 'Person A would like this, or it reminds me of them', and I buy it. That's it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

I like both

Both is good

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

I also don't really expect gifts from friends on holiday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

Ye I like both too

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Ya'll like getting stuff.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Who doesn't

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-06*

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Fun fact, Katy and Mom think I could a gold digger problem. I think that‚Äôs hilarious.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-06*

Tom League :o

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

Do you see me dating anyone right now?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

Well they don't mean right now

You said "could a good digger" so I was asking if you meant could have

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-06*

What do you mean by a gold digger problem

Are you the gold digger

Or is there somebody gold digging you

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

As in someone would date me for money. Computer science and all that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-06*

People would be gold digging him

**Bill** - *2018-07-06*

I don‚Äôt make *that* much though.

Me, a gold digger. That‚Äôs hilarious too tho.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-06*

Leanna‚Äôs Guy is the guy she met at the pride festival.

The one she specifically said she was happy to have met.

I finally made the connection.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

Yea that's what Tom and I guessed last night cuz I saw she was nervous to go to NYC

**Bill** - *2018-07-07*

Doesn't count if it was shared~!

But ye, good for her.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-07*

Doesn't count for what? Lmao

**Bill** - *2018-07-07*

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

Schedule is supposed to be out according to Georgia in BNE.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-08*

No it qint

Its still almost a month away RTx never releases its schedule till a week or two before cause fuck you

Note the duck you is for attendees

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

yea, that sounds more believable tbh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-08*

Yea she said 2 weeks prior last year and it's still over 3

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Yeah I just WISH it was out

It makes scheduling Friday hard because I have to work around the RWBY panel

At least I can square away Saturday

**Bill** - *2018-07-08*

!counter reasons-rtx-sucks sub 1

The reasons-rtx-sucks count is now 6!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-08*

Nah

I just have to schedule the group shoot around the RWBY panel

Cause if they're the same time no ones gonna come

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*



The arcade in Morristown has cosplay night.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

OMG WHEN

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

does it even say it on the flyer

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I didn't sleep well, in an 'apply head to desk' kind of mood.

sorry.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

no you gotta go to their facebook

it k

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

I didn't look at it, I just found the picture. I think it's recurring.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

I guess you have to be a girl to cosplay there too, jeez

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

is the arcade decent?

lol also i cant look it up cuz i dont know the name üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

http://www.morristowngamevault.com/gameshigh-scores/

Arcade cabinets. You pay by the hour pretty much. Most is 25 bucks.

that's not a complete list I'm guessing, since you can't have high score in fighting games.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

oo jareds been there

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

how'd you know that?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

his mom, his and his brother went june 1st

they dont have any cosplay nights posted rn rip

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

They seem to do them every few months, so probably august.

they're hosted by another group at the space. That's probably why.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

oooo neat

that could be fun, even though i suck at arcade games

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

mm.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-09*

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

PHOTOGRAPH ME WHILE IM BOUNCING

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

All no.

I mean, trampoline could make for cool shots. But like, a single person setup at a nice location.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

konkon is good at the holiday shoot

they gotta run with that theme

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

That‚Äôs about it.

Cause they want money for everything else.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-09*

**Bill** - *2018-07-09*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-11*

**Bill** - *2018-07-11*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-11*

OH THAT HAS THE TIMES THANK YOU

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

mhmm.

Gen wants to back out of RTX...?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-12*

Yeah saw that

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

Whaaat

Probably disheartened about Pyrrha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

is chris going?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

Yeah he booked the air b&b

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

ah

she was supposed to stay with u guys?

sorry im not clear on the rtx rooming situation XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

Yeah Chris booked an Air b&b

And so cause they're dating she's there too lol

She doesn't give any other explanation other than "a gut feeling" so idk

Sounds sorta unfounded to me

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

but thats where you guys are staying too?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

Yeee

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

okay

thats the p0art i didnt know

she might if you pm her

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

I kinda get it... and that‚Äôs not because rtx sucks.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

Oof I wanna talk to her but I'm in class til 2 and driving to Hals afterwards

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Like, I‚Äôve had ‚Äúbad feeling‚Äù before.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

I've had bad feelings about cons too but then I punt them away and have a good time

Like I had a bad feeling about last Otakon but we had so much fun didn't we?

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Is it about the con or just generally?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

The comments make it sound like it's con

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

I got the feeling the whole trip gave her a bad feeling.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

yea im getting the vibe its more liek the whole trip?

how long are you staying, a whole week?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

Yeah they leave Wednesday arrive home Wednesday cause they driving

Me and hal leave Wednesday (flight) get home Monday night (flight, basically 2 am)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

hmmm i wanna ask her about it but i feel like i dont know her enough

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

If it was just Con worries yeah, she‚Äôs got a squad with her who will keep her happy even if rtx sucks.

But if it‚Äôs more than that as a gut feeling...

I know I trust mine.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

it might pass too, might just be how she's feeling right now

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Absolutely yeah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

id probably be scared too üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

She's traveled for Otakon, and did an internship at Disney last year.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

maybe she associating the bad internship with rtx? cuz she had a bad time right?

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

Naaah, I mean, she wanted to come home big time, but I think she was lonely more than anything.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

or maybe there is some drama we arent seeing that making her hesitant

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

That wouldn't warrant public facebook post tho.

Unless she was doing some *serious* manipulation, and that's not her character.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

idk ü§∑

im just thinking of possibilities

and i didnt mean it like that

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

I'm not accusing you of anything Jessjess. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

*Waterproof phone cases*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

~~also because drinking~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-12*

S I G H if only

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

right lol RIP us

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

yolo lets go.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-12*

plz

**Bill** - *2018-07-12*

I technically might not need to be around for the rollout...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

Hoo boy what‚Äôs happening with momokun this time

oh people are saying she's a molester now

**Bill** - *2018-07-13*

Yeee. I saw some of that shitshow.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-13*

Yeah that

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

oo reportedly she lost a bunch of sponsorships and AnimeExpo revoked her badge and dealer booth

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

yea some people came forward about her touching them inappropriately like pulling up their skirts stuff like that. one of her friends nanabear i think it was? quit cosplay for a because of momo  making her feel uncomfortable. momo is blaming it on her ADHD, and people have said that momo gets ADHD meds and sells them

how much is true? i have no idea

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

oooooooooooooooooh noooooooooooo
there was a picture on instagram of a dragon maid swimsuit shoot where momokun is literally pulling the other girl's swimsuit bottom. one of the commenters said "the entire shoot is like this they're both messing with each other" and saying it's mutual but they didn't provide sauce for that so the molestation accusation seems right on the money atm

I know she's done a ton of bad stuff in the past

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

yea shes got a BAD record. the drug sales thing is the thing im like hmmmm on just cuz ive one seen one person mention it

ill see if i can find the nanabear statement

https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/36927765_1765634516824921_1849624547876143104_n.jpg?_nc_cat=0&oh=9127876e00446aca9171f5d20b2c819e&oe=5BE4A287

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

THAT'S HORRIBLE

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

yea so overall shes a shit person

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

all the people that defend her are just "you're just angry because she's fat"
and when people say "why can't you guys appreciate non-horrible plus-sized cosplayers" the white knights start the harassment

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-13*

Oof

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

lmao that has nothing to do with it

like wtf so if she was skinny then the community would let her get away with it or???

glad her animeexpo badge got revoked

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

Yeah I don‚Äôt get how they‚Äôre praising her for loving her body when she encourages people to get liposuction

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

YUPPP

and then telling her "friend" shed look better with lipo like fuck you

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-13*

Also how she took lipo and said she didnt

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

And it‚Äôs not a secret that she has it her body type is impossible naturally. Her stomach is flatter than mine

YEAH

is this what fame does to people

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-13*

üò±

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

yea that body is like impossible

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-13*

Assemble voltron around Georgia she must be protec

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-13*

YES

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-14*

üòá

that is 8 PM on thursday and continues the whole weekend LOL

i appreciate the dedication to organization

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-14*

Lmao

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-14*

Lmaoo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

so apparently CCE is having a formal üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-07-16*

,...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

?

**Bill** - *2018-07-16*

It's just so surprising, it's definitely not the con for a formal outfit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-16*

üòè you know what that means üòè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

~~formal Nier?~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-16*

Something coordinated lol

Nier would be interesting

Dave with Emils head and a suit

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-16*

Truuu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

I have a feeling it won't be very good üò¨

**Bill** - *2018-07-16*

Where'd you even see this.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

Someone asked in the group and an admin answered with yes

**Bill** - *2018-07-16*

ah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

Oh wait NVM wasn't an admin

So we'll see

**Bill** - *2018-07-16*

~~I'm good with no formal thanks~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-16*

My assumption would be that if it exists it's not to the late night swim day

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-16*

might be before the last night swim cuz the park closed at 9 and then reopens for late night swim at like 11 i thnk

oooo CCE has a different cosplay burlesque team. LOL they have a sun cosplayer

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

<:lenny:395307171539189760> I mean I think the rooms are booked but that's about it for me and jess

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

Don‚Äôt you have your lives planned out for the next 30 years every minor detail

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

üò±

i can barely keep track of my plans for the next month

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

Whatcha feelin for Katsu

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

cold

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

I know what could warm it up...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

Fire from the maid cafe

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

:o?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

owo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

what could warm it up

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

Fire from the maid cafe

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

I don't think that's it...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

~~is it alcohol?~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

ur right even though everyone blamed the maids it was from a maintenance room

NO

Katsucon is cancelled

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

That'd be problematic wouldn't it, *considering...*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

Georgia is a minor

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

*CON.SID.ER.ING*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

considering what?!ahhhhhhhhhhhhh tell me the secret

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

katsucon is run by the illuminati

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

~~That explains the pricing~~

Need the same kinda warmth you found at Konkon. That kinda of warmth.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

does anyone have any solid katsu plans yet

that's why no one ever leaves the gaylord except when it's on fire which is ironic

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

group hugs and hot chocolate?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

YES

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

Mm, but there's something missing... I think is missing...

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

I'm down

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

consent. that's what missing.

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

What *could it be*?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

the most important thing is consent

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

Hug consent

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

kisses? üòö

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

Do we have concent to hug you Marisa?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

katarina might be a pain to make so quickly. i might hold off on her for zenkai. but i'd like to try competing in a contest and i can't do that at zenkai if i'm helping run the contest. ~~katsu's contest is impossible anyway aaa~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

Katsu 2019 got better, there is now a Marisa panel, guest appearance

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

my panel is a combination of in-depth discussion on the fascist implications of certain hatoful boyfriend endings, and staring into a mirror making sure the wig is kind of ok i guess

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

that sounds great

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

hatoful kareshi cosplay group when

o for zenkai i'll probably be staffing so i won't be able to room with y'all but i can try to offload my hours early in the morning when possible.
late night zenkai is a toss-up because the asexual squad runs the 18+ cosplay events

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

YEA!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

wow i can't believe the boys are gonna gossip about us how rude. when we gossip about them we have to bring that up

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

ü§î

I get called a girl enough, can I be honorary?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

Understandable

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

do y'all allow ironing in the room when it's relatively empty because i like to iron a lot but i can bring easily wrinkled stuff in a bag if ironing is an issue
i promise i don't get in the way when ironing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

YE! rayna ironed at anext and then we used the board as a second counter infront of the other mirror

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

but katsu has double sinks bless

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

i was ironing at otakon and the aldus cosplayer was amazed i don't think he ever ironed before and he was like "woah you're a really hardcore cosplayer aren't you, doing this pro thing. ironing."

YEAH KATSU HAS REALLY NICE SINKS

i've mastered the japanese cosplay art of getting into cosplay in the confines of a 1 square foot space

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

aldus doesn't iron its canon

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

one of afina's servants is ironing and he's like "woah even your servants are skilled in magic"

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

depending on black friday i might be able to buy volume 4 ruby (either the pre-made costume or enough supplies to make it) if you need a ruby for your jnpr, but katsu is really pretty and fancy so ray is a must ~~also it's a warm costume~~

*do it* no pressure

we could do the triple baka saeran comic irl

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-17*

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

Monica asked for CCE shoot and this would be the third time I‚Äôve turned her down oops.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

üòÆ what else u turn her down for?

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

Zenkai and Next. Both were short notice.

This time it‚Äôd be because I‚Äôm not planning shoots.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

<:rip:369476083248267274>  monica

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

I feel bad turning her down so much though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

i mean u could make exception but thats up to u

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

I don‚Äôt want to do booked shoots though.

I‚Äôd rather pick up BNE as we romp around in the morning and do photos at our leisure.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-17*

Sakura messaged me and Hal, apparently she got drama with the people she roomed with for CTcon

I'm so glad my rooming buddies aren't problematic üíï

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-17*

Oooo really?

Was she looking for a new room for something else

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-17*

nah she just apparently had a bad time at CTcon with her roommates

seems like everyone in the cosplay community is gettin into drama

**Bill** - *2018-07-17*

Not meeeeee

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-17*

üíï

We're just cool is all

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-18*

Labinnak plugged the RTX group shoots and i got so many responses omg

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

Yeah, you said that before right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-18*

Yeah I just saw tho it said +27 responses and I was like whoa

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

lets get her to plug Nier at Colossal then.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-18*

_hey casey you wanna get in on a new fandom_

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

*Just don't bring your witch hunters*

I low key want to try and go to Lissy‚Äôs birthday. In Delaware. On a Tuesday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-18*

Same...

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

You‚Äôll be off school tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-18*

But that sacrifices work time

Aka money lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

Still easier for you to get off to do it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-18*

~~come to delaware and just hang with me instead~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-18*

I‚Äôd see you for that probably lol.

~~or were you just talking to Georgia so you can *nap*?~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-18*

Talking to both of you lol 
Tho no offense gonna say Georgia is probably much easier to nap on lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

She naps on you though. üòÜ

~~also I‚Äôm basically part pillow ain‚Äôt I?~~

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-19*

When I get super sleepy due to work and require a nap I can often times succeed and getting to nap on her

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-19*

Because in any normal scenario I usually get the boyf titty

So if he's especially tired I'm like "ok just cause you're sleepier than me"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-19*

But ye bae just come Tuesday and hang with meeee 
I'll have a body mold and we can work on cosplay, we can also style wigs we can date we can do so muchhh

I'll probably have off too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-19*

OwO lemme know if you have off or not

I need the work hours but maybe I can make something work

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

Ash and Dan are coming to collosal,Dan caved and bought a big boi room for them.

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

They don‚Äôt want to round us out to an even 12?

Gotta be cheaper.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

~~they want their own room for fuck~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

~~Don‚Äôt be jealous now~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

~~def jealous~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

~~Same~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

What did they get though? If they don't need extra beds? A room with a king bed?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

They told them they only needed one bed and they gave them a discount

It's the room with the fireplace and the tiny pink hottub

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

~~shit can we try that~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

When she showed me I was like oof Jess Gon be jelly

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

üò≠

Still probably cost like a whole months rent tho

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

They got it for the price of a desert room I think

And they are only staying 2 nights

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

Oooo nicu

So like 500 ish

Plus if we didn't room with the frens I'd feel left out of room fun

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

No worries. Georgia would probably break into the room, crawl into the bed, manage to spoon both of you and say
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. Pyrrha is here.‚Äù

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

Tru

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

Tru

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

Tru

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

Would be a nice room to get for ourselves if we went alone sometime. Ive looked at it before

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

I assume alone to Kalahari and not a con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

Yea

~~hint hint~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

~~I got it, I‚Äôll third wheel this bitch~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

~~biru plz, I haven't had alone away time with my husband since we got married~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

ooo BoJo came through! I got the zenkai stuff.

omg apparently there was a huge issue with alcohol this year? and they kicked out a ton of people for drinking/being publicly drunk at the con. there's a whole section about it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-19*

OOF

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

mainly the lobby area. you can be drunk in the restaurant/bar/your room but not in the lobby.

or rather, don't drink alcohol in the lobby. yeah.

got the room block info :3c

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

Oh hey we saw people that we knew drinking alcohol in the lobby :D

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

<@!184437198865563648> 
Zenkaikon is expanding its hotel room offerings for 2019. 50% of attendees stayed at the con center itself but they're looking to expand the room block to other hotels in the area. Be on the lookout for the first room openings literally any day now, "expected mid-July."

omg did you admonish them

i bet they got asked to leave owo

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-19*

I barely know him <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**TIM**

The alter ego of Tom

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

yeah i was gonna say is like that your evil brother

of course you guys wouldn't drink in the lobby at all

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Which means @everyone watch Zenkai social media for the announcement.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

i'm still readin' through the notes there's a lot but ye keep yer eyes peeled

18+ wristband system might be a little different too

next meeting is before the fall so there'll be updates then

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

Just need to make sure we can book in the hotel.

It's so worth it for Zenkai.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

so many people get free badges omg i knew it was a lot but wow. like 10% of people.
i guess it makes sense when you consider staff + guests + artists/dealers (they get like 2 or 3 badges free when they get a table) + children but only like 100 children under 10 attended

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

what does Zenkai like to post to first?

Twitter?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

ü§î

probably their facebook

they also have an instagram

twitter and facebook get updated at the same time i believe, but there's always a news post on the actual website itself first.

dealers and artists were voted as "most important event" by attendeees in the feedback lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-19*

I can't setup alerts for the website though.

I have twitter and facebook setup to notify me when the con posts.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-19*

that's why you just constantly refresh every minute

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

oh wow CCE is doing after hours water park friday and saturday each night costs $25 üòÆ

http://colossalconeast.com/events/frisat-night-waterpark-party/

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

Sounds perfect.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

ye, little spence but its nice

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

Oof MORE money

The kalahari is already expense üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

its like the same as the Sheridan  ye?

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

25 dollars is less than 80!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

80? üòÆ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

80 is for the full weekend aint it

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

That's the con ticket. A day in the waterpark, if you aren't staying in the hotel, is 80 bucks.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

con ticket is 40

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

oh then isnt the 25 on top of that?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

SO
Con ticket: 40
Both late nights: 50 together
Room: 200-250 ish

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

oof

the late night shouldnt be so much ~~honestly i was thinking it would be included with the room~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

nah the park closes at 9:00

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

This is special for the con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

they need to pay to keep everything running, and pay employees for every ride, food stand and bar

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

i guessss

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

It's worth it. Unless you want to go to a room party somewhere in the hotel.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

or just chill, its all up to you. you could go to late night one night ant not the other, or not at all

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

You'd have to find one, but you know.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

~~yeah its just expensive for someone who makes 11 dollars an hour~~ üòÖ

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

Well now you can work more right?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

yeah now that yesterday was the last day of class

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

yea of course

~~the employees there are probably making less~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

yeah thats also probably true

colossalcon itself is gonna be worth a whole week of work

not including paying for cosplay stuff because i own only three bathing suits

why do i cosplay, doing drugs would be cheaper lmao

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

no it wouldnt XD

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

it might be!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

~~yea youd save alot of money by dying an early death~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

true!

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

*she not saying she's going to switch to drugs lol*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

_and id be a canon pyrrha_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

lmao i know

plus your bdays commin so you probs gonna get some cash moneys

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

yeah but counting that as money ill have to spend isnt good financial planning

so ill assume i have to work max colossalcon hours lol

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

noo i dont mean  use that as your whole plan, but itll help

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

hopefully üôè üôè üôè

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

I think i might get a small locker this year so we can easily stash our wigs and stuff so we can go on rides

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

http://animenyc.com/cosplaymeetups2018/ Why is *every* con trying to control photoshoots?

Not a *single* one can do it well.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

Cause they have good intentions

Not every con assumes people are Facebook savvy in finding shoots themselves

/votes for RWBY and league

That's dumb that they want their own people to host meet ups, it really limits the number of meet ups that can be held

But I guess it also gets rid of incompetent shoot runners

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

LOL i clicked to many

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

I guess at the end of the day, unofficial meet ups can always happen

If RWBY gets one of the top spots though, I'm sending them the shoot list

I'm not letting them stumble through this shit lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

no it doesn't, look at Katsu's official rwby. The shoot runner was 45 minutes late.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

Yeah that wasn't staff tho that was some incompetent dude

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

who wouldn't be charge if not for Katsu meddling.

<@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> <@!228287793099440128> Leanna doesn't have a room for CCE, I'mma offer to her.

Assuming no complains?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

YEAH SNAG DAT LEANNA

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

neeeevermind.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

We tried

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

~~the others might be Ethan/Casey~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

Eugh

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

ooo shes rooming with them?

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

No idea. Just spitballing.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

ooo i didnt read the opther chat first

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

Unrelatedly. I'm trying to decide on going to Lissy's thing. Feel like it's kinda weird, given I don't know anyone going super well and I'm going out on a limb to do it. (I'd just burn the day I had reserved for Otakon Friday I didn't use and I have a super chill boss, but they don't know that?)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

she invited you so why would it be weird for you to go?

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

~~paranoia?~~

I live over 2 1/2 hours away and work during the week, so the whole thing is rather nuts?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

its only nuts if you think it is

shes not gonna be like "omg i cant believe he actually showed up lmao i invited him as a joke"

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

~~I didn't even think that what if she does that~~

~~She probably just meant to invite Hal and clicked the wrong button (She put a disclaimer that if anyone's missing, it just cause she did the invites quickly fyi)~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

ive never talked to her, only meg

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

is nuts, but it feels like a good idea, weee.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

then go?

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

yo the fuck lo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-20*

I'm not going cause i need the money for work lmao

**Dave** - *2018-07-20*

Just don't let the rooms get too crowded, Joe will be the one who gets mad

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

It‚Äôs 10 now, and I mean, I‚Äôve been clear from the start.

If a friend needs a spot to sleep I‚Äôm helping.

**Dave** - *2018-07-20*

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Bill** - *2018-07-20*

He can have as much floor space as he wants?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-20*

well up to 12 right?

no more than that?

**Bill** - *2018-07-21*

Yeah. I mean that in the sense if he won‚Äôt share bed space.

HA. That's a price drop. Guess people didn't want to pay 180 dollars.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-21*

shocking since inoue has a big following don't they

**Bill** - *2018-07-21*

Seems like it. I've heard stories that she's kinda a bitch to work with tho.

and imo she ain't all that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

Well 180 was for katsu wasn't it?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-21*

idea: a boudoir shoot but it's fully clothed with way more clothes than you'd usually wear.
i had this idea when thinking of ray poses

Omg this year‚Äôs Otakon badges are totally a ripoff of voltron

And like 40 other shows

But voltron came to mind first

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

OMG yes

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-21*



**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-21*

_100 for 30 minutes, whoa I wanna make 200 dollars an hour_

I don't even make 200 dollars a DAY wow orz I should've been a photographer

Someone go back in time and tell 12 y/o not to cosplay but photograph instead

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

I mean you don't make that everyday tho, and there's still many more hours that go into editing. You may make a couple thousand in a con weekend. And then not make anything for the next month or more

**Bill** - *2018-07-21*

Hashtag freelancing.

Also inoue is a photoshop person, that takes a lot of time in post. I get away with few minutes edits because I do global adjustments and only adjust the the light.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

Like they might have another job, or might do different types of photos. You usually end up shooting all weekend and editing all week. Winters are typically slow. It's possible to make another of money of course but it's not any less pressure then any other job. And it alot of cases it's alot more pressure, esspcially if you work with photos of people as opposed to product photography

**Bill** - *2018-07-21*

Any contact work is like that.

*contract

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

Yup

**Bill** - *2018-07-21*

Con photography specifically is at best extra pocket money. Wouldn‚Äôt even call it a part time job, Since you have to pay to be there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

Yea. It really depends on how much they do and how much they make, technically if you make more than $400 on the side after expenses it's supposed to be claimed on your taxes

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-21*

I wonder how many people actually do that ü§î

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

Lol probably not very many üòÇ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-21*

Unless photography is your job, I think most people don't

Cause it's just a side job/hobby thing

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-21*

Yea you can still technically get audited, but it's not likely you will unless the government noticed you making BANK with no explainatio

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-21*

Imagine getting audited cause you made 401 dollars and didn't declare it lol

**Bill** - *2018-07-22*

60 is a pretty average price for photos, usually 30-60 minutes.

At 5 shoots that‚Äôs only 300 a day.

I think I‚Äôd be aiming to break even, not go positive if I charged.

I do wonder how much people would pay sometimes though. Because natural light and light editing in post I don‚Äôt always have consistent con photo quality but...

Can‚Äôt help but wonder.



Facebook: *choose a side*

@everyone Zenkai rook blocks at 9am Monday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-22*

üëå

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-22*

Ye post procession‚Äô takes forever for some images. I imagine inoue spends a long time on it and that‚Äôs part of the reason they charge so much but occasionally I‚Äôve had to spend several hours just on one picture.

~~fix your costumes so they don‚Äôt have to be photoshopped correctly and cover up your tattoos so they don‚Äôt need to be edited out~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-22*



Shit we‚Äôre missing it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-22*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

*Did someone say shipping?*

*No one did, I said it myself*

So I tried to cheat the system for Zenkai. No doubles available (90% sure because the block isn‚Äôt available till tomorrow) BUT kings were available. So as a safety net, we have three king rooms booked.

Will be doing the double hunt in the morning.

Zenkai is booked.

Doubles.

Rate is 144 a night, which is still the best rate in the con circuit.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

144*3

LMAO opps thought the calculator was open

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Put it this way, for three rooms it's 1438, which is less than 2 rooms at the Sheraton.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-23*

i know i just wanted to do the math anyway

108 a person if we have 4 in each

**Bill** - *2018-07-23*

Dunno if we'll need the third, but since there's no deposit we have the space if we need it.

Now for everyone to watch AnimeNext social media.



I guess we‚Äôre all missing out huh.

Aw snap.

Wow Otakon, pull the stick out of your ass.

if she's not posting using the official otakon account it means it's something she did on her own <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

ive seen other cons ask that too tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

I‚Äôve never seen that.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

think i saw it for katsu?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-07-25*

it's very popular in japan for big events

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

Posts line up without the banner just to rebel right after

Also are we still looking to fill our colosslacon rooms? And if so, Peter and Vincent are looking for space cause they didn't get a room apparently

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

i think we're full?

maybe not but i dont think we have room for 2

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

Sweet billiam the room coordinator, wherefore art thou

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-25*

i could be wrong thou. i think he driving

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

Like, Gens Peter and Vincent?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

Yeee

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

I wouldn‚Äôt offer to them... not really our type of roommates I think. Don‚Äôt know them well enough.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

Could wait til after RTX and then I'd be able to vouch for them? ü§î

I gotchu tho

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

Yeah, same reason I gave an initial no to Jordan at Zenkai with Hal. I just don‚Äôt know them.

<@!228287793099440128> if you doing pre movie drink at Red Robin ping me when you‚Äôre going. I should be back in town by then.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-25*

~~Jordan's a sweetie and still needs a zenkai room btw~~

~~Georgia can vouch for her as a person they met~~ 
~~I can vouch for her as a roommate, she was the one who took care of con rooms in the before Georgia days~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-25*

Before Georgia days! Dark days üòÆ

**Dave** - *2018-07-25*

I just need to head home and put in an appointment for a haircut then I'mma just head to RR. That would probably be around 5:30

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-25*

I heading to the dentist early at 5:20, hopefully they take me

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

So you‚Äôll be there at 5:30? Or closer to 6?

<@!228287793099440128>

**Dave** - *2018-07-25*

Traffic was light so I'm heading there now so I can at least have more than one beer @bill

**Bill** - *2018-07-25*

I‚Äôll head out shortly then.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-07-25*

Survive RTX and come home safe and sound.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-07-27*

~~and get all the sweet details~~

**Bill** - *2018-07-27*

Just survive, the drama in the south is way too real. I like drama as much as the next Leo (it‚Äôs a thing apparently) but when there‚Äôs internet bullying to the point of suicide attempts steer the hell clear.

**Bill** - *2018-07-31*

Hello!

**Dave** - *2018-08-01*

üçª

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

going to comiket early vs going later. what do.
if early i'll have to wait several hours in line, and go on a packed train.
if later the trains and lines will be much less but there won't be any spots in the cosplay area. hm.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

D:

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

it like this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

do you has fren?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

ye but they can't go until sunday. we're gonna try and do the magi group!
i might go friday to scope out the place and take pictures, saturday to cosplay mari, and then sunday for magi. I also have to go to the mmk booth on sunday to buy their new publication.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

oooo! wuld you have to wait in line all 3 days?

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

~~don't cosplay there alone~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

yeah üò≠ the con is free, but it costs $8 per day to cosplay so i gotta find where the changing rooms are

*but its comiket*

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

its *comiket*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

omg this is like prime cosplay real estate right here

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

do u have like pepper spray?

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

how many harem anime have you seen where girl cosplays at comiket only to need Ordinary High School Student boy to save her from the many *creepy* otaku.

I've seen *a lot*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

i get more creeps out of cosplay then in cosplay. hm.
i know some cosplayers from acosta events, but i don't think they'd be going to comiket. if pains' group goes that would be nice but they're really cosfamous so i probably couldn't stick around for long.

i think getting a good spot and getting friendly with neighboring cosplayers is the way to go

you can see here, at cons the cosplayers just pick a spot and set up camp there and stand there all day. any photographers who want a picture will line up in front of them, so the cosplayers are usually against walls or cones or natural barriers. you'll have your neighbors all day.

OH AND DISNEY GUY. i dunno if he'd be at comiket ,maybe not, but he's also super popular. rose says he always talks about me when i'm not there yay

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

thats so scary

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

be strong for cosplay jess

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

id feel so weir

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

most cosplayers don't have super long lines like that. i think the most people that lined up for me was like 2

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

Justifiable feeling. Marisa needs safety friends. Especially at comiket, the mother of all conventions.

I mean, have you ever seen that many guys with camera in the US? never.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

cameracon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

bring knife

you stab any creeps

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

they has a bag check

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-01*

Where are the girls with the cameras?

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

Pfft.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

they rare

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

I feel like they rare here.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

where are the boi cosplayers? D:

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

they also rare

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

Nor would they do 'hall' shots like the comiket setup.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

the boys are dressed as girls

super convincingly

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

japan is wild

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

~~but seriously doing a concern, comiket is wild girl~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

yea me too! üò≠

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

i survived anime japan! kind of!
more people honestly creeped on me out of cosplay then in. 2 years ago i had a guy follow me and try to feel me up when not in cosplay, and this year 2 guys asked for my phone number and one asked for a photoshoot not in cosplay. like. why.

i'll be fine in cosplay <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-01*

mawisa you has to be safe! you has to send messages to let us know you are okay, and and put the japanesse equivilent to 911 in your phone

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

119? :3c

i be ok!
if i somehow get popular that'd probably be advantageous because the wall of photographers would prevent any one guy from being overly creepy, the others would push him away

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

And then that one guy has friends who will help him follow you home. üòë

Fame is an annoyance, not a perk.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

good luck i'm behind 17 proxies

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

*Marisa.*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

that's me!

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

You're an adult, you know Japan better than we do, and you've done cons there. Do us a *small* favor and do be careful when you're there so we don't worry over you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

lol at this cosplayer at an intersection

okie dokie i try ‚≠ê

*adult.* uguu.

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

*If you weren't an adult we'd drag your ass home*

That resident evil cosplay is fucking lit.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

i'm pretty sure that's the guy whos eye moves and blinks too

~~maybe i could cosplay for all three days~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

Maybe if you have a *friend* with you.

*BUDDY SYSTEM*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

i will on sunday! :3

maybe friday i can wear sheryl's uniform if i can just figure out what shoes she has

red heels! i have red heels.

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

*Then cosplay on sunday and get buddies for fri and saturday*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

do the RFA count as my buddies

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

*No*

Seriously, Yuri guy would have been way creepier if you didn't have your friend with you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-01*

i can call them anytime for just 5 hourglasses
i don't think yuri guy would've approached us if we weren't together, he didn't get individual shots of us haha

hehehe do you think it would turn creeps away if i said i had an onii-san
they always ask if you're in the country alone or with a group and i always say i live with people but what if i was like "oh yeah i'm here with my onii-chan"

start acting like i have a brother complex

**Bill** - *2018-08-01*

That will probably turn them.

<@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858> Survive the group shoot for me. I expect an after action report which hopefully doesn‚Äôt involve a RWBY cat fight.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-03*

WE SURVIVED

we're queued for the RWBY panel now

Have not spotted Ethan yet today

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-03*

I didddd

**Bill** - *2018-08-03*

Oh good and it seems like you‚Äôre having fun. Carry on!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-03*

Nice!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-05*

did two people get engaged at georgia's photoshoot
georgia makin' magic happen
people are going to start using you as a lucky charm ~~especially in ladybug cosplay~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-05*

~~Stops self from seeing what options are still out there for Otakon~~

I love how much Erik loves RTX. Like, he‚Äôs *living*.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-05*

Right??

**Bill** - *2018-08-05*

It‚Äôs just his style of conning.

He‚Äôs in stride.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-05*

I'm jealous,I wish I could enjoy cons that much

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

Alright Hal and I are daytripping Saturday of Otakon

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Yeah we‚Äôre not doing it from the looks of it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

I don't think so ‚òπÔ∏è I want too I a sense but it'll be really expensive ugh I'm still conflicted

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

As do I... and I realize there‚Äôs a city day for IBM Thursday and getting out of that is more sketch than I‚Äôd like...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Ah yeah. Ughhh üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

So it‚Äôd have to be a Friday morning, which is cheaper but rougher cause of the distance...

I‚Äôm usually the enabler around here but I need like, a co enabler on this one.

Sigh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Like I wanna go one min and the next I dont and then I do and sizbuabfkjr

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

~~day trip~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

I think you‚Äôll manage to have fun without us though Georgia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

Yeah I somehow managed with RTX

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

It's a 6+ hr drive

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

That‚Äôs a 4 hour one way day trip stupid.

‚ÄúSomehow‚Äù

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

I'll still be counting the days til CCE tho üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Oh I though it was 6 opps probably is with traffic

I'll make you a deal, get Marisa there and I'll go üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Yeah, plus the extra time to where I start.

Doing the weekend doesn‚Äôt bug me, and springing the cash is doable.

It‚Äôs the trip versus time there. Leaving Friday morning early, driving to get there in the afternoon has us with half of Friday, Saturday, and half of Sunday.

Which... honestly isn‚Äôt terrible.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

What time would we leave Friday morning

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Depending on dead I feel Friday. But cons have a way of energizing.

Piss early.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Like 3? 4?

I want to go. But it's a terrible decision

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

It is doable but a terrible decision financially

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Ye

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

Plus we've done alot of cons this year

For us anywayd

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

Ugh my heart says yolo and mm and my brain say you dumb ass

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-06*

And while I'm like YEAH CON I'm also not attached at all for any reason to go to ota

Like I wouldn't be hype but I'm sure I'd have a good time

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

No, actually... it‚Äôs actually flat four hours from me.

So 7 would have us there lunch time.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

With no traffic yea

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

>w>

I gotta figure out what to wear

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Maps includes traffic, but true, I didn‚Äôt have it set for morning commute.

Still, 7 isn‚Äôt that bad. Hell, better than my work commute.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

Lmao tru

~~grinds out A2 in three days~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Most events we‚Äôd do Friday will be past noon.

And we‚Äôd save 200 bucks by not staying over Thursday.

More, including parking cost.

It‚Äôd be way more worth it than liberty city anime con. That‚Äôs for sure.

>.>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

are you volunteering to drive?

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Yeah.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

what hotel?>

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Not even with the fact I usually do, I owe Tom for Katsu.

I thought I found a room in the Henley park hotel. Right nearby.

It‚Äôs not a chain, but good enough reviews to try it.

I‚Äôd have to call to be 100 sure.

100%.

Don‚Äôt want to book and find out it a king.

>.>

Do I?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

from Home (101 Signal Hill Trail)
to The Henley Park Hotel, 926 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20001


3 h 50 min - 5 h 10 min

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Mhmm.

As long as I‚Äôm not alone in the car I can do a long trip.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

watch i go, and i cant even get in the MM panel

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

You WILL have to wait on line forever.

Lineacon.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

wonder how early

wonder how much autographs are ü§î

im so undecided

im like 60% on going toms like 40

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

The listing was off for that hotel. They have no two bed rooms, though they have a suite for 20 more with a sofa bed/sofa.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

well just all sleep together

tfw no MM photoshoot

would have to wear cosplay down there too

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Might be able to do the connecting hotel, for 300 a night.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

eh 3 mins isnt bad

its  3 min walk

hmmm badge pick up too

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

No, but given room availability.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

there still rooms in the concenter?

how?

cancellations?

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Ota doesn‚Äôt buy everything.

And the original block rate would have been lower, likely.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

ooooo ok so still 2 hundred per person per night?

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

The con center is 300 a night.

The other one was...

229 for the suite, 199 for 1 bed.

Actually 179.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

but concenter would be be same price as you originally gave for the other place

for 2 beds?

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

No.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

does the con center have 2 bed or 1?

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

1 for the 300. I need to drive home from the station, give me 10.

Otakon has this retarded booking portal. Worse than Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

voice call when get home?

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

Yeah <@!351471675843411978>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

I could hear you fine though...

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

i couldnt hear you and i need toms input

<@!184437198865563648> did you get the confirmation email for RWBY shoot too or just me?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-06*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

Okay I'll forward it to him

My phone is in weird times cause I'm in Texas

So I'll confirm shoot times when I'm back in jersey lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-06*

is there an issue with it?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-06*

Nah I just can't tell what the confirmed time is cause my phone is in a different time zone

I won't forward it if you don't wanna, I just figured you'd like to take a peep at it

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

it's fine, you can.

I imagine you realized you don‚Äôt have my email. Also when is your flight <@!245270932602486784> ?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

9 pm oof

Sitting in the terminal?

Willowlark@outlook.com

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

Yeah security  was literally only 5 mins

We're WAY early

Austin is actually a pretty smol airport

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Check the website then.

<@!301927856240459777> I want a guest for Zenkai, Kira Buckland and 9s‚Äôs voice actor.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

Hewwo
It‚Äôs a little late for recs so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible for next Zenkaikon but let me check the site and I‚Äôll give ya a link to where they ask for guest recommendations
Also for autographs as jess mentioned, usually they‚Äôre free!! At Otakon. Sometimes they‚Äôll sell a special poster or item that fans can get autographed if they didn‚Äôt bring their own items and that costs like $20 but it‚Äôs limited edition and only available there.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Hnnngggg

Mawisa whip up dat ray cosplay and hop a ona plane

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*



omg deuce is recommending labbinak and mangaloo be official guests for zenkaikon what

anywhere here the link
https://zenkaikon.proboards.com/thread/185/guest-list-2019

usually autographs are super difficult to get for mega popular guests, and otakon has a very strict policy that you can't start lining up until like one hour before the official autograph time. they'll chase you away if you start lining up early, and they'll kick you out if you arrive after a certain number of people show up, so you have to time it perfectly.

they do sometimes have guests giving autographs in the dealer's hall instead of the official autograph area, and those aren't listed on the schedule. i was one of like 5 people to get a sweet autographed Ballroom poster ~~and horribly embarrass myself by not knowing everything about the anime~~ because I bought a cheap folder at the official booth and buying merchandise got you a free autograph ticket

if you have nothing else they'll also autograph your con booklet

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

<@!351785752197201920> conu?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

i dont have an answer yet

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Oh wow that's alot of rules for autograph but I get it, the MM peoples have two times they are doing autographs one on Friday and one on Saturday, I have prints of all the characters I could theoretically bring if I go? Id probably go for Ray's first then seven then v then yoosung

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

are they fan-made prints? like artist alley stuff? that wouldn't be allowed üòø  official merch only, or autograph boards

are they all signing at different times? usually they pair or group up for autographs so being in line for one puts you in line for everyone

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Ohhhh whoa! Ok yea they're not official

They are all at the same time

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Alright, if you want to sleep on it do that. I worry about losing the deal, and I need to tell Gord I want off, so let‚Äôs do this by lunch tomorrow. That fair?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

oh wow yeah they're all separate!! that sucks!

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Oh well guess I'mma have to but dat saeran body pillow

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

lol otakon knows they're gonna be so popular

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Ye I'd honestly be sacred if I'd even be able to get in the panel

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

yeah i suppose so, gotta decide soon anyways, therse not much time

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

Such is being impulsive.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

biru how do you feel about cosplay events here that have several hundred cosplayers and just one room like this

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

PLZ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

it's great right

it's like the gazebo but with backdrops

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

I can show you the trainstation with my boss in the pic, just ignore him

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

he's a train

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

Idk if panoramas work on discord ü§î

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

EXPERIMENT TIME

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

it still a photo.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*



**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

nice boss

station looks pretty generic

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

ye.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

yea i mean its ncie but ü§∑

outside would prob beter

nothing special thou

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

where i used to live there's an old quaker farmhouse that's fully intact, used for school field trips and whatnot but would be really nice for a historical or nature/magical-esque photoshoot



the inside is also exactly 1800s

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

ooo das nice

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

so Magus Bride.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

YEA

thats what i was thinkin

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

~~same but it's not the canon house üò≠ BUT CLOSE ENOUGH~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

just slap come ivy on that bitch

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

i used to live around the corner from this house. no one bought it because it was such a huge house surrounded by all these other ordinary houses. the closets were bigger than my bedroom and it had a servant's pantry. who did they expect to buy this

also its backyard was literally a country club

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

holy butts

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

i wonder if there's a church anywhere that'd let people do church photoshoots

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

I've thought about it. I bet I could get Abiding Peace to do it, but it's a modern church, none of that classic look.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

Jakescribbles told me one big reason a lot of dudes smell is cause they don't actually wipe their butts when they poo

He said he's been in the bathroom and heard guys just _not do it_

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**Ashley (Swolfy)** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**Dave** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**Bill** - *2018-08-07*

WHAT

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-07*

Ye that's what he told me

We were talking bout con funk

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-07*

Ashley said Dan confirms this üò∂

I for one have no experienced such

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Same. I can't imagine it.

<@!288513265661902858> I‚Äôm going to start putting together CCE info, can you let me know what you‚Äôre doing?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

oh nooo. oh no. whoever is running otakon's tumblr page might not know what they're doing. this could be an issue and it's so easy to change if they just e-mail registration.

otakon has a reverse escape room ooo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Like they trap you?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-08*

naw you gotta break into the room

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Oh neat

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Aww, I feel popular. Ryan wants me to do team SSSN on Friday, Meg wants me to shoot (I was going to message her anyway, since we didn‚Äôt actually shoot Next and she had asked), and aquacosplay.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

nicu!

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Whaha.

*Also*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

~~we could go frisay~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

ill have to change for the rave if its saturday im not raving in a sweater

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

Also I found 10 dollar parking like 5 minutes away from con

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

It‚Äôs Saturday and Sunday.

It SUCKS the jazz club isn‚Äôt going to be there this year.

We should be able to. Hopefully.

~~I‚Äôll speed if I have to~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

theres a rave on sunday?

or rwby?

i confuse

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Sorry, race Friday Saturday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

ooo ok

that makes more sence

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Rave

We were talking getting there between 11 and 12. If we leave by 6 that should be the timeframe.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

yea barring any problems not sure if tom and i are wearing cosplay down or just changing when we get checked in

which would mean no costumes for shoot ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Let‚Äôs look at timing again in a bit, getting lunch.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

I think I'll ozpin at Ota

Dont really got any groups or match ups so why not an oldy

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Got a suit, you can be Jumin Han probably.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

LOL

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

get ready to SWEAT then

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

Wait what is everyone's plans for ota

~~also bae there are so many friends at OTA now it might be worth staying longerrrr~~

Assuming we can figure out a potential room plan

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

lol there was no plan 2 days ago, but uhhh for now Nora, Mystic Messenger MC, and idk sunday yet

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

~~does that mean if we show up at all Friday jnpr can happen~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

ye

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

~~fuck fuck fuck fuck~~

~~you said the summoning word fuck fuck fuck~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

if we leave at 6am, worst case is 11am arrival. We'd easily make RWBY shoot.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

_this is so last minute its murdering me_

bae does that mean were going friday now too

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Don't stress it. Not like we're stopping cons after CCE.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

i just hate last minute things

i get it from my mom oof

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

yea im having a stage 10 freak out as well

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

I know. üòõ So don't kill yourself.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

less now but monday i was a wreck

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-08*

I'll ask my parents about it later 
Also if we go Friday we should figure out our explicit idea plan for where we stay that night

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

Idk what I'm doing sun, maybe nothing

But for now the plan is Ren and unknown

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

aaand my new camera strap system be here.

perfect.

So now that Georgia and Mangoloo are tight, and we‚Äôre bringing Georgia to CCE, is mangoloo going to be around us?

*snrk*

Watch she remembers me as the guy who asked if she knew Georgia.

Mood: Not needing a fucking suit for a con.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Oh yea das good

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

bigger Mood: not needing *dress shoes*

<@!228287793099440128> Bring your air mattress just in case. <@!351471675843411978> I *can* throw the d3300 into a different camera bag, if you'd like.

There's a Nier shoot, 3pm on Friday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

*shakes fist angrily that im missing rwby AND nier*

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Most Nier shoots I've heard about were crap so...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

~~i just wanna see all the beautiful people billiam~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

~~if no one shows up to Nier there's no one to see~~

But RWBY.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

goes friday, wears weiss, pops off ponytail and puts on dirt for nier shoot

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

There's a *blazblue* shoot.

You could Weiss to that lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

wheres the shoot list?

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

https://hiroko.otakon.com/events_schedule.asp

and Noragami, dang.

~~why the fuck doesn't RWBY have two shoots~~

~~fuckers~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

and miraculous ladybug

fuck

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

More importantly, who didn't setup a Mystic Messenger shoot when half the cast is there?

Fools.

ooooh, some one setup a second persona shoot, IE, likely not the same guy who always runs them.

Nice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

yeah theres persona and then persona 5

why is everything i care about on friday cries

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

RIGHT that's what I said!

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

~~you're going friday~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

and theres no single day badges

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

oh, about the MM shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Ye

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Set it up Jess.

Do it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Lmfao I don't even know the layout of the convention center

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

I do?

Georgia does?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Well just pull a 2b squared

I've got enough to worry about

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

"Pull a 2b^2"

I love it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

~~no league of legends shoot but a homestuck shoot? what the fuck~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

lmao wtf

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

~~are you *really* surprised, you were the homestuck queen~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

its 2018 let homestuck die

both games were circa 2009 if im not mistaken

and league has a way bigger following than homestuck has left lmao

I SAW A HOMESTUCK AT RTX THO

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

~~and you knew them~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

n o

they were a god tier dave

there was also a star guardian lux there

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

That means nothing to me.

Unless you meant Dave Dave.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

they werent gray lol

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

yeah league is 2008

oops

meant 2009

the concepts for some of the OG characters were released in 2008

like BLITZCRANK

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

UGH THAT BITCH

yeah i think homestuck started 2008

whenever obama was president first (homestuck ran the whole time of obamas presidency)

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

With bug though...

It's a hard series to do a group shoot for.

We learned that.

Cause everyone cosplays bug and chat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

you noticed tat at anext too yeah

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

~~I also took over the shoot, yes~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

bill and i are the bonnie and clyde of photoshoots

we drive in guns blazing and kick the door down and take it over

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

üëà  üòé üëâ

I'm shooting Ryan's SSSN group yeeeet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

_spots are going fast_

billiam i think im doing yang but idk plz save room for your biggest fan üôè

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Meg, Lissy, Aquacosplay, and Ryan.

Plus Jess and Tom, and you.

Since it's fairly chill Friday, we'll do whatever you decide friday sometime in the mid afternoon Jess? ~~Make it Renora and we do spicy weekend~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Well prob do renora Friday I think

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

I can't decide if I want to do MM panel with you two.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Like 90% sure I'm doing renore Friday but not sure if Tom is coming with me or not

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

It's like, 3 hours of the con but I can make 'you hate V' jokes the whole time.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Nevermind you're not invited

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

*Shouts to whole line*
"This person hates V"

Georgia, when you getting to con?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

gooood question

i would ask hal but hes napping

friday is looking so tempting now but thats 100 dollas sobs

i wish they had one day badges

~~maybe ill just lobbycon~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Lissy is.

But ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

well, also try and get his CCE plans from him.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

If your only comming Saturday then it's 70 I think? But 100 if Friday too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

yeah all the events i want are friday

like literally all of them

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Rwby and Nier shoots? Or are there more?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

miraculous ladybug also

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Oooo wow

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

like 100 is such a steep price to pay after sinking so much into rtx, and i dont wanna do anything at con besides see people and take photos

but also im really against lobbyconning so it would be hypocritical

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Yeeee

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

SIGH ill talk to him about it tonight

he has a dinner too so he'll be home around 10

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

<:pyrrha_scream:426395020736724993>

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

100 as opposed to 70?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

i meannnn

BLUH fuck otakon for such high prices its not worth it

ill probably just lobbycon no matter what

maybe hal and i will go just friday

who knows

~~this plan was so last minute im mostly just angry at it now~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Then don‚Äôt do it?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

Awww yea I understand

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

i wanna see people and hal wants to go

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

You‚Äôll see us soon enough, you saw everyone else at RTX...

If it‚Äôs going to stress you don‚Äôt do it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

id just feel better if this was a concrete plan made way in advance

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

So would I. I book everything first day it‚Äôs available. But seeing all the con life at RTX, knowing we could get a room nearby for a good price, and being Disposable Income Squad, we can afford to be impulsive.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

~~and it was stressed af~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

I‚Äôve also been on and off considering it for a month now. Booking is old hat to me, parking fell into our lap...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

ill see when hal wakes up

i need to bounce what the heck we're doing off of him

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

But, that‚Äôs me. You need more to be comfortable. Don‚Äôt stress yourself trying to match what we‚Äôre doing.

You‚Äôre already leaving for vacation the day after, I‚Äôm surprised you said you‚Äôd do Saturday to begin with.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

eh

the problem is that i budgeted RTX with the intention of not needing to spend money afterwards

which is really the only barrier to Otakon for me

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Aaaah.

Fair.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

otherwise im pretty rested from RTX and emotionally ready to commit to con and cosplay

but i dont like that our plans are up in the air, nor the fact that its looking like ill have to put out more bucks than i wanted to

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

You always want to con and cosplay. üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

false, tuesday i didnt want any more cosplay lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Sorry kid, you and Hal are on your own plan wise.

Can‚Äôt do the thing where I do all the stuff this time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

correct

and hes busy til 10

which leaves me stirring with his uncertainty for at least 3 hours ugH

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Play Nier lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

why cant i be actually cosplay famous so moneys never an issue

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Wait till you have a stem career job. You‚Äôll be in disposable income squad.

50 bucks on patreon a month is chump change.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

_god what a life that would be_

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Or if you end up at Thor... they seem to pay well enough.

That‚Äôd be sooner.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

yeah

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

(Dunno if NASA internship would pay)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

5k-6k for one summer

as far as research goes

and yeah idk ive gotten more somber about money in the two weeks that this divorce thing has been announced

like my mom was upfront to me yesterday that we dont have the money to stay in this house more than a year or two more

with two being the maximum

and she said we're gonna have to be more frugal now that my dads not contributing to the bills at all

and its like U G H adult problems go away i am only an adult in training

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

üò¶

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

i mean luckily we're not scraping by

and the house is valued at 1 million dollars so

selling it nets us a big chunk of change

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

Hugs kiddo.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

lol thanks

i mean luckily it looks like that guy is gonna bite on the commission

i officially quoted him 500 today for materials, labor, and shipping and hes gonna get back to me

and ill try to put more hours into youtube and hopefully monetize that

~~goes into boudoir to pay mortgage~~ jkjk

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

You‚Äôll be dead.

Commission is good, and opening up to more will probably be more successful than YouTube.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

probably

its just never guaranteed side money

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

That‚Äôs just time.

True.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

yuuuup

i mean thankfully im good at making pyrrha after all this time, which is also a rare skill

so hopefully that can net me SOME stuff

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

At 500 a pop, yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

thats without leg armor too

so im optimistic

its just hard being confronted with adult problems and stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-08*

I'm sorry things are so confusing right now. I understand what you feel like regarding the money thing. It's really hard to plan with things like that going on

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

yeah i mean at least i know im coming to terms with the whole divorce thing

my dad hasnt left yet, and it mostly doesnt bother me

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

It is hard. Fucking sucks. But you‚Äôll make it through Georgia. You have all of us, and more importantly, you‚Äôre a strong girl. I have faith in you.

üíô

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

thanks guys üíû

**Bill** - *2018-08-08*

You need anything we‚Äôre here.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-08*

Yeah üëÜ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-08*

‚ù§

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Tom, Jess, you guys good spitballing like 11amish for Spicy Messages?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

11 is when da autographs are for the MM but I'm not sure if I'm going to attempt that yet üò¨

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

nah, then we do another time.

It's worth trying the events for the VAs. üòÉ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

They have them at 3 on Friday too but RWBY shoot is? 2?

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

I don't like, have a schedule for saturday.

RWBY shoot is 1 to 2.

Dunno how early you have to be on lines for autographs. Ping Gen in BNE, she's waited on autograph lines at Ota.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

Oooo ok I could try friday then, but I either have to buy something for them to sign or buy something they have there

Also it would obviously be cooler to meet them in mm cosplay but it's not like a requirement

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

You're going to the 11am signings.

I have *nothing* solid for saturday. We'll do a different time lol.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

Okay dokeeeey

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

https://www.pinterest.com/willow_lark/portraiture/couple-poses/ We putting some of those to work for Renora at least, if not Kidnapping Kinks.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-09*

the "SNEAKY PETE"

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

The focus for Renora is definitely spicy. We had the weapons at Zenkai, and original one was katsu ~~and sucked by default~~, but now it's time to let everyone know dis ship still sailing. üå∂

And as we all know, Kidnapping Kinks is Jess living out a husbando fantasy, sooooo... üòà

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

I THOUGHT YOU MEANT SPICY LIKE WINK WINK SPICY OOOOH

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

but then you said weaponsss

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

I'm not sure what your brain is getting up to.

Throwback to the original Otakon JNPR references page, I still love this one.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

why he scared?

oh we getting double spicy? NICU

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Embarrassed, and double spicy what?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

spicy with renora, spicy with unkownXmc

double spicy

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

ah.

Well, your aniversary is coming up and any ship is better than Adamx2B...

You have to live up to Ryan's shoot.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

y tho üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Admittedly, I'm pretty sure Dan is going to be the Sun in their full SSSN so... *They may try to top themselves*



~~or each other~~

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/gallery/2017/09/26/Seamonkeys.html

I miss Tristan.

~~Wow that album is on the *15th page* of the cosplay section, that's over 50 albums.~~

And there's actually 20 total.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

nicu

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

I need to make an index... and tag galleries by con and do a con index...

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-09*

You mean for Zenkai? Jordan?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-09*

Yeah

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

1pm Saturday.

Need to confirm Meg and Lissy and that‚Äôs the requests side. Georgia/Jess&Tom have plenty of float room. I know there‚Äôs a henceforward group with Dan, though Zeikani dropped HF!Yang. If I see Dan I might try and get to shoot that because henceforward is baller.

But for now, bed. Tomorrow is going to be a long day.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Pains is going too but he has a booth, and a girl I know who does a super convincing Levi cosplay is going. If I run into trouble I shall seek them out. The Levi cosplayer also said she wanted to see me she‚Äôs so kind she hands out sponges to people.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

I'd be game

When would we drive back tho

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Did you find out about Ethan via another source?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Which info?

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

That he‚Äôs not going.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Oh yeah no BNE said

That's it

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-09*

Wed drive back saturday

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

He said Saturday 9 PM

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-09*

i checked 
friday seems to be gucci too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Ye I can do Friday

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

*And then they left, forever a part of the elusive and famous RTX group for the rest of their days*

üòõ

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

oh stop

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Hunter got our Anext badges idkkkk

He just really wants me to plan a Woodbridge RWBY meet up tbh lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

I‚Äôm *Teasing*.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-09*

he what

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

I remember him yes.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Hunter gave us our Anext badges early so we didn't have to sit in line

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-09*

ooohhh

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

He a good

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

I don‚Äôt have the paperwork anymore for d&b but if you decide to look into it I‚Äôll see if I can find it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

I mean it sounds like one of the best options

It's indoors, there's stuff to do

It's just the crowd that would have to be fought

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Mm, it‚Äôs unlikely there‚Äôd be enough interest to book the place outright.

Granted we went on winter break didn‚Äôt we?

If it‚Äôs winter, and not the school break, should help the crowd.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

True cause then POS kids can't get in

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

You‚Äôre 20, what POS kids lol

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

i mean the general public kids

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Mm.

The portal is a fucking scam.

The hotel doesn‚Äôt want to honor the parking. I chewed out the Otakon people for false advertising, they‚Äôre going to talk to the hotel and get back to me. Also the price the portal displays doesn‚Äôt include taxes, they only include those afterwards.

Fuck Otakon‚Äôs booking, seriously.

But, we can stow our bags if we get there early. üôÑ

But the distance is important, given the white pride rally down where that Marriott deal I got through chase is.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Eugh forgot about that

That's messy shit

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

It‚Äôs only Sunday I believe.

But yeah. Imma white Mom these sons of bitches.

Cause I was lied to *twice*.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

shit so now parkings not included?

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

The hotel says it isn‚Äôt. Otakon booking company says it is.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-09*

They better give you that shit for free

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-09*

Use them RECEIPTS BILLIAM

YOU KICK THEIR BUTTS

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-09*

The booking company ofc, not the hotel

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

Booking company is escalating the issue.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-09*

GOOD

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

And if we have to pay, I‚Äôm going to see about meeting the Otakon chair while we‚Äôre there.

We have comp'd parking again. üòè

Though I'm going to call the hotel in a bit to confirm that for sure.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-09*

Yeah better off

Nicu

**Bill** - *2018-08-09*

is confirmed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-09*

I passed a table selling Star Wars / Fate doujin called Saber Wars and it looks amazing

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

<@!351471675843411978> when is the signing for Nines' VA? and are you going to it?

oh no i found it its the same time as the nier shoot

thats ironic

_and the voice of A2 is the same time_

***the real A2 v. 9S***

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

That‚Äôs how they getcha

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

What time is it?

They grouped all the mm vas together too

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

3 PM

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

I don't know? I don't really know how it works I know the mm people ahve a slot Friday and Saturday

So we we're almost to birus and realized we forgot Tom's wigs üò≠ üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Yea last min planning got me in a tizzy too

Yea I was thinking about maybe getting sevens on Friday and saerans on Saturday since Tom will be cosplaying him but I think it might be same time as RWBY shoot on Friday

~~i like saerans voice better tho opps~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

what about yoosung

/asks him to do the crying sound

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

i almost wish i couldve done a casual A2

id have to go back to NJ to get my shit to pull that off anyways and thats NOT worth it

i guess i packed only pyrrha stuff and yang stuff specifically to stop myself from changing last minute

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Yea I get you

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

_i am my own worst enemy_

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Dk2PpBZqgX_0f2wTNtyU7Wgqy5pz8L0LNEw48X04As/edit#gid=0

this schedule is so naked its unsettling

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Don't worry about a schedule silly

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

They sell wigs at ota, some are decent prices

**Bill** - *2018-08-10*

That‚Äôs because you‚Äôre just going to be hanging out with us!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

r-relaxation!?!??!?! NANI?????

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

We already back home

**Bill** - *2018-08-10*

You don‚Äôt need a schedule to squad up.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

I always need a schedule because

idk

my brain works that way

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

You can‚Äôt relax at a con there‚Äôs too much to do that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not called a relax

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

NVM mm signing are same time as Nier signings

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

oof

if its an "2 item policy" i can get u thing

if you bring me thing

OH I WAS WORRIED I DIDNT HAVE ANYTHING FOR THEM TO SIGN BUT I PACKED MY NIER GAME FOR NORTH CAROLINA FUCK YAEH

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

"excuse I need ALL my sad hacker Bois signitures"

Na I don't have any official merch üò≠

I'd have to but something

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

I think ota is a one item per person üò≠ 
They can sign your Otakon book

Guidebook

**Bill** - *2018-08-10*

I mean, I made a schedule too. But shoots.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

INWOUNF AN WALL

INFOUND A Wall WOO

I can stand in place

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Oh wait I can get 9s on Saturday at 5 I think

If I want it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

9 to 5

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Do they have like official prints there you can pay for for them to sign? Like at the table?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

Sometimes, some do, but most don‚Äôt I think. MM was saying if you have a card from one of the VIP boxes you‚Äôll get a special print but otherwise they have regular paper I think

At Otakon most don‚Äôt. I used signboards last year

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Ooo rip ü§î

What's a sign board?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

Wait it has to be official merch?

That's a thing?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

Hmm. They won‚Äôt sign sketchbooks but maybe you can grab merch from a booth

Yeah official merch

A signboard is a square board it‚Äôs a japan thing for autographs it‚Äôs pretty neat

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

~~sign my phone case~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

I didnt know about the official merch only rule

That's weird

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

Oh the website says they might sign personal items. Japanese guests usually aren‚Äôt allowed to by their contract,  I assume cheritz is the same



So artist alley stuff is usually a no go

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

Oh okay I don't feel bad for leaving my A2 poster at home then

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Yea I was gonna bring my prints if that was allowed

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

What is "unusual items" lmao

Like "sign my boob" or what

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

Rose gets Todd Haberkorn to autograph her Barney VHS tapes. She has a collection of them with Todd in it.

Maybe stuff like the BNE flag

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Ok so I'm going to assume that there is a autograph page in the Otakon book that is blank, i can get them to sign that, then maybe cut the Sigs out and put them in the frame with the print when I get home ü§î

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-10*

Yeah! There‚Äôs usually a blank or two page towards the back just for autographs. They can also autograph their description and picture in the book

I asked one guest to do that and he drew a mustache on himself because the image was old

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

Oooo! Ok I might be able to make this work then

Omg that's hilarious

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

‚ÄúThe little girl who was lost from her mother has now been found and reunited,‚Äù says the speakers
The entire con bursts into applause. So pure.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

Worst con morning ever üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-08-10*

Aaaaah should have paid for Thursday hotelllll

Not thatcould have.

Fuck badges.

RWBY shoot is behind badge checking people. Ryan says you may be able to sneak by using the stairs and not the escalators. You won‚Äôt make it through Prereg beforehand. <@!245270932602486784> <@!288513265661902858>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

Is there any way people can smuggle us by with badges and then we meet y'all?

Like if you, tom, Jess go in, and Jess comes back with your two badges so me and Hal can get through?

Cause you're right, there's no time to sit in that line

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

We don't have badges yet

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

Oh shit so y'all aren't getting in either?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

I'm not even banking on making the shoot at this point

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

Wow that's jank

Where's the shoot location?

**Bill** - *2018-08-10*

Hall E concourse.

Around the hall from video game room.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-10*

If only it was on the stairs like it was last year

Stupid shoot

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-10*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-14*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-14*

the story of how rwby started

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

I didn't think he managed a Hal face.

Me: *Wow, I know what I'm doing.*
Me: *Who says I'm amateur*
Me: *Oh right.*
Me: *I do.*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

that's a macaroni face

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*



*Mawisa censored the shoot photos!!!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

w

what were you doing that had to be censored

don't tell me i don't want to know

rhetorical question

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Nothing actually. Flash hadn't recharged.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

Why is my chin the strangest thing in existence

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Surprisingly consistent numbers.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

1

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Meanwhile I took 128 last year lol.

I just don't do Hall shots anymore.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

oooo. i think i was averaging 4000 or so pictures per con before i left (that's everything so like 3-4 pics of the same thing, hall shots and meetups). it's just not worth taking as many pictures at big events in japan because of how differently it's done, i barely took two hundred at comiket.

over all 3 days

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

tldr japan cosplay sucks for some reason.

I can hit 4000 on a full con weekend, raw count. It's been declining as I do more private than group shoots.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

it's good, they have a ton more resources here for it. i bought ranka's seikan hikou outfit for $20 today ~~but it's missing the sleeeeeves ahhh I gotta make those tomorrow~~
but photography is just meh. you can see in my mari pics there's always people in the background, and you have to line up to get a picture

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

right, cosplay *photography* sucks.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

yee. the act itself is super easy. 
they have stores just for wigs, just for makeup, just for props, it's great. lashinbang still has that fake violin too hnnng

looking at hand placements for violin stuff doesn't help so i'm just gonna figure out the mystic mess theme by ear on my violin when i'm at home and hope there's enough time to practice it a decent amount before katsu

uugh i dunno what to bring to katsucon there are so many options
definitely ray
i really really want katarina so def her especially for the ball

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

yasss Katarina.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

Ray üíñ

Which song are you learning?

You probs told me this already but my memory is garbage

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

i might do the mystic mess theme, i'm better with fast songs because i'm too impatient oops

i did that taiko game with buri today and easy mode was too lame so i went for hard oops

i have literally never played violin before so something with a melody that i'm used to will be easiest

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

üòÆ are u in a group?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

biru said andru was gonna cosplay andrew

is that still happenin do you know what day that'll be

it's no problem if it is that's why i'm askin' now

i could probably do katarina and akko on the same day because brunettes

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

I only know I'mma try to do suit saeran. That's my only plan for katsu so far üòÖ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

SUIT SAERAN WOO

black suit?

i should find out if meg and flora are doing fire emblems

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

I highly doubt Andrew has thought about Katsu.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

I was thinking yea and then you as ray and Tom as unknown

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

that should occupy his every thought

WOOO

YEAH

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

And we can get coo pics <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

You and me can fight ‚úä

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

yay but also aww

ARM WRESTLING

oo saeran and ray are kind of like monokuma and monomi. at a photoshoot once a monokuma got really into it and literally pulled my wig off i was like "i appreciate ur enthusiam but pls don't literally fight me"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

Oo ye that sounds hard to play

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

i'll try and figure it out somehow yolo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

I promise I won't actually fight you

Actually that's smart for packing cuz Tom could probably wear the suit to the formal. ü§î  gotta see where the chain attachs tho

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

this'll be me at katsu lol

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

~~no i'm gonna suck i've literally never played violin <:lenny:395307171539189760> ~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

You can do it!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

i can bring my flute if you really want musical accompanyment i can def play flute

harmonica ray

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

Lmfao

Whenever I hear harmonica I imaging like a bunch of bearded dudes around a campfire hearing beans out of a car.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

that's it that's katsucon

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

And then just insert ray into that scene

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

holding a little flower

that's the after ending

rfa camping dlc when

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

OMG lmfao

I'm litterally cracking up üòÇ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

jumin's never seen a can before

"don't you feed your cat?"
"yes. the chef buys fish for her at the port every day."

seven makes yoosung paranoid about bears
jumin is like "that's ridiculous. assistant kang, print out a report on bear attacks."
jaehee is like "with what computer there is no printer here"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

WHAT BABE

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

the babe with the power

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

What did I miss?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

Bearded dudes hurling beans out of a car I suppose <:lenny:395307171539189760>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

What no not out a car they are around a camp fire

Oh shit I can't spell

It's supposed to say eating beans out of a can

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

No no leave itt

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

üò≠

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

Out of a car sounds that much more redneck

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

Jumin would be be guy who agrees to go camping and pulls up in the state of the art mobile home while the rest of the members bring tents and smores

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-16*

he misunderstands the point of camping and has resort villas built on the spot ahead of time

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

Man baby powers go

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

Probably

did we go to CCE firday last year?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

I think Fri? I don't remember

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

Friday.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-16*

ooo ok that makes more sence

i was remembering wanting to cosplay the day we got there but i couldnt fathom why i wanted to cosplay on a thursday XD

going down thursday will be nice so we can get some water park time without cosplay

**Bill** - *2018-08-16*

mhmm.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-16*

Ye

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-17*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-17*

i haven't opened it recently cause it kills data and i hit my max :c

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

Wait Pokemon go or the "what Pokemon are you" thing?

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Maybe I should have gone to LCAC since I was in the city. Would have only been for an hour or two, but could have seen David.

Hindsight is 20/20.

<@!245270932602486784> Your options are likely us or old squad. Admittedly I was thinking we'd go down by you if we can swing it work wise (probably would work), but if you wanted to come up by us that's lit too.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-17*

for the rwby showing?

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-17*

rutgers to rockaway is apparently only 50 mins

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

yeah, you'd be by us in no time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-17*

yeah i can do rockaway

thats where the most friendos are going while also being a reasonable distance lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Not the most, but the best. üòé

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-17*

Both!

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Think Dave is going to show up just so he can have a pre movie drink. ü§£

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-17*

yeeeeet

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

If you end up worried about driving back I work from home fridays, you‚Äôd be welcome to stay over and leave Friday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-17*

nah its all good

i still have class friday morning anyways

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

Mhmm, offers there if you need it.

I'm buying ticket early, not a reserved seating theatre but probably still worth.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-17*

CCE time off approved üëå

**Bill** - *2018-08-17*

nicu

I'm going to put in that floating half day for the thursday.

Cause then I have an excuse why I won't be answering slacks.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-18*

This what it looked like during a lull but catch that guy on the left



**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-18*

He flail

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-18*

like a medieval torture device

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-18*

üôÖ

**Bill** - *2018-08-19*

New annual event at Otakon: The Gay Off.

We also need car pool plans for next weekend.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

Is that new
They‚Äôve had lipsync for your cosplay events based off RuPauls drag race for at least 4 years now

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

<@!228287793099440128> <@!351785752197201920> Have you heard anything from Joe about the room? He's good right?

and aware he likely sharing a bed?

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

I .. think

He's still good.fpr the room

**Dave** - *2018-08-20*

Ill bring my air mattress, since it's a small one, incase

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Dave is a hero.

hÃíÕëÕõ ÃêÕ£ÃëeÕÉÃÇÃê ÃêÃêÕ≠rÃöÃÅÃΩ ÕÆÕëÃÜoÕóÃÖÕÑ

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

<@!245270932602486784> I meant to ask at Otakon; why were you asking Jake about Nathaniel? Something happen at RTX where he's less of a nice guy?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Oh he just REALLY hung around Meg

To the point she was ~~highkey~~ uncomfortable

And he even pointed out that she was avoiding him

And still tried to hang out with her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

OOF

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

So he was a little problematic there

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Same problem, just elevated.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Yeaaaah

Like I don't think he was intentionally trying to make Meg incomfy

He just really likes her

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

Yeeee...

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Obsessed. I mean, you don't buy plane tickets for people you don't know.

It's too much.

~~Granted accepting is also a poor decision~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Yeaaah he doesn't have much money I don't think

But he paid angryjigglypuffs rent one time

Which is like wow

And he invited jennyplays to RTX even tho she doesn't watch anything roosterteeth

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Yeah. Weird sensibilities.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Yeah nothing outright malignant but some stuff he just doesn't "get"

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

I was curious, since last stance I was aware of was 'helpful spy in the drama filled land of RWBY fame'.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

He still carries that title IMO but he's also someone that just can't seem to connect 2 and 2

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

And backing Meg is more important.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Ye she's a good person

And I feel closer to a lot of people at RTX

~~before it was just like "I kinda know you"~~

Also side note, I caught up on BNE, I wonder who Erik doesn't want seeing his stories üëÄ

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

I'll give you three guesses love.

First two don't count.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

rwby needs characters in ballgowns so when something uncomfortable happens to cosplayers they can hide under the nearest hoopskirt

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

steelwolf?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

EthanEthanEthanEthanEthan

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Nathaniel.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

darn wishful thinking

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

probaly all three

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

*Seriously? I don‚Äôt just think about Nathaniel randomly on a Monday morning.*

He said specifically Nathaniel.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

he did?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

"no one in BNE"?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

musta missed it

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

DM.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

OH HO HO dang

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Erik doesn‚Äôt like to make drama.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

ooooooooooo

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Yeah I think meg wants him out of their darlings group too

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Erik is waiting for her to kick him.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

That's gonna be rough

He messaged meg asking if they could just be normal friends

Cause he only had a "passing interest" in her

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

YEA RIGHT

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Erik feels bad cause Nathaniel isn‚Äôt like, bad, just weird and Erik doesn‚Äôt want to ignore him but he does. I told him his discretion helps Meg avoid awkward situations, and that‚Äôs a noble act to make. Compared it to us making sure you never got stuck with steel at Katsu.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Megs gonna kick Nathaniel at some point I think

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

O that's rad

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Yeah 100%sucks tm

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

how long u in Hawaii?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

I get back the afternoon of the 27th

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

nicu

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Bring me back a volcano :V

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

I have no bag space

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

if you can't bring back a volcano you have to go inside one

it's how things work

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Fear

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

~~anyone else notice that, apart from Snow, only southern cosplayers cause drama?~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

must be the accent

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

I'm starting drama to disprove this theory :V

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Don't you dare.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Are we considering Mist a part of starting drama at all

I wouldn't but if we are shes from Pennsylvania

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

i'm here for drama who we messin' up

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

No one, the drama cycle closed out post RTX, though the threads for next season are in place.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

new cosplay drama callout post for global warming

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Now that Erik is confirmed doesnt like Ethan I'm waiting for that drama to explode

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

üôèüôèüôèüôèüôè

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

When was that confirmed.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Well more implode

Rtx

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

OH did we not tell that story?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

üá® üá¥ üá≥ üá´ üáÆ üá∑ üá≤ üá™ üá©

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Lissy confirmed it

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Mangaloo isn't doing any rwby at CCE, so CCE is likely to be fairly relaxing (though I expect Georgia and Hal will get room party invite(s) which may be breeding grounds for new drama).

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

i think you guys told us at ota

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Yeah I thought we mentioned it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

share! share!

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Basically lissy told us Erik puts up with him

But like at rtx for example

Ethan would come up to talk to him

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Cause Erik was with his friend who's name escapes me so we'll just call him Cool Guy and Cool Guy and Lissy we're talking with Erik. And some convo topic came up about people they don't like? And Cool Guy was like "oh yeah, like that douchey guy you hang out with" and Erik was like "Ethan? Yeah" so Lissy said that Erik essentially just tolerates Ethan

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

And Erik would give him the nod and say yes while looking at his phone treatment

I think its John or josh

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

John sounds right.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

ooooooo

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

This isn't really news though.

It's nice that he'll admit it, but he was tolerating Ethan around when Georgia cut ties.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

Verbal confirmation is new

I think

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

mhmm. But we knew.

Ethan was cheating him with the business, not treating him fairly...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-20*

when you say cool guy you say it in the voice right

there's no other way to say cool guy

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-20*

Its different 
Erik was still treating Ethan as a friend after the business fully died

As he told Ethan my comments in BNE post thing and said he didnt like hearing shit talk about his friends in the chat

(He said it in q much more polite and passive way tho)

We've known he knew Ethan was an ass, before he was an asshole friend 
Now Erik thinks hes just an asshole that hell put up with

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Fair enough.

and if we can ever get Leanna to hang with us, maybe we'll confirm we've rescued her as well.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

erik just puts up with him cuz he doesnt want drama

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

But I've had enough of the drama catch up this morning.

Thank god CCE should be mostly clear of it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-20*

WHOO CCE LES GOOOO

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

bill when was the best time to shoot for CCE?

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

I had said we'd shoot 11-2 with our group + Leanna now, do shoots, and I'd stow my camera after that. I think I'll have my camera out longer though, as long as everyone doesn't do the water park without me.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

okie dokey

should i just set aside the whole 11-2 time chunk then?

just wondering cause im making mah schedule

~~super productivity today post vacation woohoo~~

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Are you planning on doing anything else?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

nah i was just wondering in case i stumbled on a meet up in that time slot but i havent

that works well too cause nier is 2 pm friday and rwby is 2 pm saturday if you wanted pics of those

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

if you need to do we could focus the block, but I quite frankly am treating it as '3 hours of focused photos before fucking around the rest of the day'.

~~I'm running both of those remember~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

idk brotato maybe you got tired of taking group shoot pics üòú

but ye ill chunk off 11-2 then

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

~~actually~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

_i love not having commitments before 11_

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

~~because no one would expect you to get up before then~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

realistic expectations tbh

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Don't I know it.

Also I'll definitely do photos for Nier, it's going to be super small. like, RWBY at Kogarafest small.

RWBY...

hmm.

What‚Äôs your meetup?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

i didnt find any but im trying to surf through events on facebook now

so i was wondering just in case

though i doubt anyones gonna make a star or fallout meet up, and thats the only fandoms that are unaccounted for r/n

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Star has been big recently.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

true, with the final season comin up

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

It's just been extra popular at cons.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

I don't wanna plan anything.for collosal

<:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

now that im back from so much travel im in need of work to do

so ive been planning all day boom boom boom all my medical appointments, cosplay stuff, everything

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

feeling refreshed?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-20*

im almost sick of vacationing if that makes any sense

i need some STRUCTURE

not just waking up at 11 going "what am i gonna do today"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

Oh yeah I get that way too

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

mm.

refreshed is different tho, you seemed shot by the end of Otakon.

~~I'm not going to end up socializing at all at BNE because I want to do photos for everyone I can~~

~~why am I like this~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-20*

I wonder how this is gonna go

**Bill** - *2018-08-20*

Who knows.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-21*

i can't believe i missed this and didn't know it existed until now. it's a yearly anime dance competition in maihama.

guys i have an idea for a masquerade skit we just need a really buff body builder

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

So are we meeting up before the movie?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-21*

tom and i are going to the mall

**Bill** - *2018-08-21*

<@!228287793099440128> ?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-22*

o panel apps are open for zenkai if anyone wants to run a panel

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-22*

ü§î

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Kotoricon is two day now.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-22*

Oh wow

**Bill** - *2018-08-22*

Second weekend in January. >.>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

so when hal and i went to davids graduation, the first thing allegra/sakura said to me was "be weiss for all these groups"

and then wanted me to do a bunch of stuff

including a team rwby at ANYC

and then she started doing the scheduling for it and was like "lets do it friday"

and i was like uhhh i wont be there friday?

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Aaaaah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

and she was like "well we already planned stuff for saturday so it has to be friday"

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Fuck em.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

Guess no weissu for you then Sakura!

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

and i was like "technically sundays an option" but also i dont know if im doing that, and suiting up in full weiss for a sunday is GANK

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

We‚Äôre going to ANYC to shop, maybe run a shoot, and hang out.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

LIKE weiss is too much effort for a sunday

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Maybe go someone where nice in the city.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

yeah so like, im not doing that now

i just didnt appreciate the assuming and steamrolling like that

üò§

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

You tell her girl.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

and like all she would talk about was cosplay with me

and what my cosplans are

and con plans

like i asked her about life and work and shit

UGH IDK SOMEONE SAW WEZREZ AND NOT GEORGIA I GUESS hhmmph

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

That‚Äôs sakura.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

she messaged me about it in NC and im still upset about it

like how could she assume like that

i mean i guess i lowkey do that too, like im like "hey does this work" to people and i assume that usually it does

but shes like "well that doesnt work for me so we cant do it"

like she didnt even have a reason other than the fact that she had different cosplay plans

i legitimately wasnt gonna be there friday

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-23*

Tell her to find a different Weiss then

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

She strikes me as someone with a clear division between friends and cosplay, and someone whose got tunnel vision regarding her hobbies.

I think it‚Äôs the way she is.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

She doesnt have a clear division between friends in cosplay

Cosplay is her thing

She finds a similarity and latched to it hard

Latches

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-23*

idk it very much rubbed me the wrong way

_i see utility in the mangaloo defense squad now_

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

Yeah

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Assuming that much is over kill tho. Especially when you are so inflexible.

No witch hunting.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

Mangs defense group doesnt witch hunt

They screen

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Ah, that side of it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-23*

Jigglypuff was the only witch hunter, and  they very clearly dont like her

**Bill** - *2018-08-23*

Sakura is like a work friend. She‚Äôs into her work, and outside of work she‚Äôs not really into friends. You don‚Äôt have to work with her if that‚Äôs not what you want, since you treat cosplay as a social hobby.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-23*

Did they change anything about the first day of kotori? It‚Äôs usually had stuff on Friday for the last several years but it‚Äôs only like 4 hours

I cant believe Georgia and Wezrez cosplay are two different people. Just like Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

*Wow* thats the second time Rei has announced Georgia holds a party for Georgia.

<@!245270932602486784>

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

When I tell you I hosted everything in high school, I hosted everything

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I know you hosted it, you told me about how last years went.

Personally I‚Äôd want to tell people myself though.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Yeaaaah

Idk

Reiley's kinda like that

They think I have my shit together always 100% of the time unless I say otherwise

(I guess I give off that vibe üòé)

So they assume I'm always good to host

Which is fine, I would have done it anyways probably

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

üö∑

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Just puts pressure on you to do so, in the case you might *not* want to.

Because it‚Äôs a public setting Rei is putting you forward in.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

True true

Which means they must explicitly WANT me to host it

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I‚Äôm sure they do. But pressuring you into it isn‚Äôt the way to express that. I doubt it‚Äôs intentional, to be clear. I just don‚Äôt like that kind of thing cause it would make me a bit uncomfortable.

~~I was expecting you to Halloween too after all, and I‚Äôm glad for it cause no one else we (NRTH) does~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

and i dont do the holidays, i just do new years, so im grateful for gingerbread üòÑ

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

You‚Äôre welcome to Christmas Eve as well, if you don‚Äôt have family obligations.

Daycons in fall: ANYC, Kogara (it's free, might as well again?), I think Derpy?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

whens kogara?

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

No idea.

some weekend in october or november.

it was second weekend of october last year. No news on it being run again this year tho.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

thats not a good sign oops

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I mean, it's not something you have to plan too far in advance for anyway.

they also don't have Kogaracon 2019 listed, so they may be behind schedule.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

i do for work schedules lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

oh shit right.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

my whole schedule is full up through november so id have to move things arond

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Was it on a sunday?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

i dont remember....

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Nope, Saturday.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

poo

Bill was the total for CCE 184 per person?

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Okie dokey just making sure

I'm calculating how many extra hours to get next week lol

I get paid next Friday so I'll transfer you the muns then üëè

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

no problem.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

That photographer pass for CCE is weird

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I don't get it.

Good thing i don't care cause I don't charge.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

<@351471675843411978> I'll need you to figure out how much well owe

Ah so there is a breakfast buffet at Kalahari

Plus the cafe has breakfast food

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

118

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*



**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

oh nice.

~~pancake Nora~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

yea but the buffet is like $22 or smth

nope, sorry no spending that much money to fill up in 10 seconds

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

tru.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

now if you could pay 22, and return all day for food that would be worth

also im not wearing full nora at ccee so

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Swim Nora doesn't like pancakes?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

~~swim nora bloats at the sight of a pancake~~

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Yeah, maybe one day if in starving

It's 20

Prob just hit up the cafe

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

thats typical for hotel buffet.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Yeah I know

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

but also yeah, likely don't need a big breakfast.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-24*

ok babe well send one of us in with my purse and they can fill the purse with food and bring it back out to the other one

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

Opens con bag "hey kid you want a waffle"

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-24*

Lmao plzzz

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

i should probably check if theres any panels i wanna go to huh

some of these panels are interestingly named

"nerdy kink party"

are we basically ignoring the formal ball?

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

I am.

I expect well wander into panels if we‚Äôre bored and that‚Äôs it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

THERES A HOMESTUCK PANEL O BOI

ooo theres a mythology panel

theres a panel titled "crawl out through the fallout" AND its 18+

the in character contest sounds really really cool

ok theres three panels im interested in, which is three more than more cons



**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Fallout and what?

~~kinky nerd party?~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

mythology!



i wish i had context i really do

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

Oh so kink party is on your list. üòã

Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs the boudoir panel again.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

NO the last one is the in character contest

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

That was good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

She was drinking up on the stage and I was like üëåüèª

Hmmm... I‚Äôm not sure what kind of Lolita would suit you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-24*

**Bill** - *2018-08-24*

If it's not high I want to do the option with easiest money transfer for you and everyone else, though my mind is like, crapping out right now on which combination that is.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-29*

hey n'y'all
have you considered
https://zenkaikon.com/news/zenkaikon-2019-staff-applications-now-open

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-29*

<:lenny:395307171539189760>

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

i think i have to re-fill out the new staff forum even though lizzie said i can keep my spot on the cosplay crew.
i just have to remember when i first started working there.
i can figure it out by my con pictures. if 90% or more were taken in the dealer's hall, that's when I started staffing <:lenny:395307171539189760>

wow look at all these wonderful positions that are open
https://zenkaikon.com/info/volunteering/staffing/staff-positions

they've even got a photographer spot <:lenny:395307171539189760>

i don't recommend staff suite though. that's essentially sitting in a hotel room all day, and con attendees aren't allowed in the staff suite so you can't interact with any attendees. just tired staff who are constantly in a hurry and too exhausted to do anything so they stare at a TV with johnny test playing while eating a stale sandwich

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

I‚Äôm not staffing tho.

October 27th is the photo plus expo in NYC. Any takers on checking it out with me? The ‚Äúdealers‚Äù Hall is free, which is what I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll visit for. So only cost is the train in.

Unless that‚Äôs when you‚Äôre planning Halloween Georgia. That‚Äôd be first priority.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Yeee that's Halloweenie

That's the weekend before Halloween itself I think (which is a Wednesday ew)

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

Ah, well screw the expo then.

None of the con stuff is happening till later thursday...

Kalahari has that spa...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

naruto gets a massage

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-30*

Doo ittt

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Ok I think total what I'm packing for CCE: Swimsuit A2, Swimsuit Pyrrha, Yona, Sole Survivor, and possibly I'll throw my Weiss wig in my bag

Oh and swim Ladybug

That's the same swimsuit as Pyrrha just a different wig lol

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

Sole Survivor?

Does Weiss wig mean ponytail, or wig in general, cause I thought you were doing post haircut A2 for the night swim.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Sole survivor in case I feel like actual cosplay at some point

And Weiss means + ponytail

Cause I need the short version for A2, so I'm gonna throw the ponytail in there just in case I feel like being swimsuit Weiss somewhere in there

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

üëå

and then do the thing where you put a scar on your tum like you been stabbed. XP

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

YEAH TRAGEDY

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

what suit would you wear with Weiss tho? ü§î

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Probably the black and white polka dot bottoms

And?? Idk

It's mostly just in case I need more WOOBY lol

I'm not stressing it

**Bill** - *2018-08-30*

nicu!

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-08-30*

Yeah I'mma bring full Adam if I'm feeling it

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

biru u goin to the potential fire emblem shoot at zenkai?

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

It's clearly a standard group shoot. I only go to those if friends are in them.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

andru u goin to the potential fire emblem shoot at zenkai?

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

@ him if you want his attention on discord.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-08-31*

u gotta believe in the power of friendship

surely he reads every single thing that goes on

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-31*

Bill im about to pay for colossalcon

Am i correct reading the formula that i owe 55?

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-31*

And how much did i owe for dinner

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

32.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-31*

Kk you should have just received 87 via paypal with a note saying 55 room + 32 dinnee =87

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

Got it.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-31*

Question 
For me to get a pass that convers saturday throuhj sunday

I need to either buy both days or just the 3 day past (either way its 50)

Should i wait till i get to the con qnd hope they have a slightly cheaper rest of the weekend pass on saturday

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

The con badge?

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-31*

Ye

Like when i say buy both days i mean separately

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-08-31*

its prob gonna stay 50 for the 2 days

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-31*



Wow first Jacques I've seen besides Mark

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

ANYC has mail badges?

That‚Äôs nice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-31*

<@!184437198865563648> 175 for hotel did you say? I can transfer it to you now üëè

**Bill** - *2018-08-31*

Yeah.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*



CCE packing more like "do I only wear red, black, and white?"

I still have to finish Yona after I fucked up on the jacket the other day but after that, I should be set

<@!351785752197201920> <@!351471675843411978> JNPR tattoos?? What's da plan boissss

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-01*

Hmm ü§î unsure

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

YONA

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

I'll order tattoo paper tomorrow since I'm out

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Can't wait for ~~JNPR tramp stamps~~ matching tattoos ahhhhh

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

Has the Otakon room been booked?

Reportedly there were a lot of technical issues but the marquis sold out before 12:05. Courtney managed to nab a room

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-01*

I don't believe it has

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

I may have forgot about that.

Room blocks usually don't open till 8 or 9 tho.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

i saw someone claim they got one 45 minutes before the roomblock opened by calling

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

that does happen.

I usually try to do that.

oh well fuck us.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

they still have some within walking distance

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

They upped the opening to yesterday at noon.

That's why people have rooms already.

It was announced for today.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

ye, they announced a few ago it was moved üôÄ

cambria suites is the closest they have that still has openings

rip nevermind it's a waitlist

the renaissance across the street has one-bed rooms open. it'll be like bravely default.

otakon has a lot of communications issues

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

yeah.

Booked two suites in the embassy suites, king, but judging by Jake's room and the occupancy they all have sofa beds + room for air mattresses.

217 a night isn't bad at all, and it is close.

Now I'll try and get a hold of the marriott marquis/renaissance.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

"hewwo mawiatt? pwease do u hawv rwooms" say that

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Depending on my patience for the automated answering machines.

(This is why I ask everyone else to watch social media for room stuff as well, I am not infallible and can miss things)

*cough*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

i didn't realize until courtney posted and i checked their social media i'm sowwy üò≠

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

I don't think I follow otakon üò• I follow AnimeNEXT, zenkai, CCE, animenyc and katsu but I think I forgot ota

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

Don't have to apologize Mawisa.

Ye, I muted Otakon notifications cause they wouldn't shut up during the event. I never turned them back on.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

That's kinda BS that they moved it up though

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

otakon can't even communicate properly during the con. it's a logistical nightmare.

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

mmmmhm.

Marquis is out, likely so is Renaissance. The latter has double rooms, but the cost is double the embassy suites.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Oof

Stupid Otakon

_they emailed yesterday asking about reviews, they gonna get one_

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

I'm not really torn up with Otakon; everything is so close together it's not the end of the world.

Embassy it is. Every room has a pullout sofabed.

And will have room for at least one air mattress.

Otakon booked...!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

i wonder if there's a statistic for how many people sleep on the balcony at katsu

"a well functioning system" for otakon? üòÇ

**Bill** - *2018-09-01*

It actually let's you book, so better than Katsu.

Still, I'd rather work with the hotel directly.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-01*

"wow nice hotel concierge cosplay. totally realistic. very in-character too."

NO ONE TOLD ME THIS YEAR'S OTAKON AMV WINNER WAS SUCH A GEM

this is so good

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5J8XPuCnMA

everyone who just woke up is realizing they've been bamboozled by otakon owo

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-01*

Good morning otakon fucked you over

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-01*

Another day, another con ganKING US

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

a photographer friend did a milk bath photoshoot? because apparently those are becoming common or something among some photographers? but it looks so uncomfortable. milk is so expensive.

CPAC is finally moving into an actual convention center

and it doesn't clash with zenkai this year. shocking.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-02*

Could prob do power that turns the water milky

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

"get in this milk powder water"

"for the aesthetic"

it'S LIKE THAT ONE PHOTOSHOOT
what was it. gummy bears?

YEAH the flippin' giant boxes of gummy bears at katsu

170 pounds of them

**Bill** - *2018-09-02*

Both of those happened this year.

I miss the campus tbh.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

really? did you go?

**Bill** - *2018-09-02*

Mhmm.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

it rained on the campus a couple times i went, which made it a pain to go between buildings for events.
has it improved at all?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-02*

Nooo it's worse

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

how that possible

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-02*

They put ALL the events in one big atrium

So you could hear cosplay wrestling AND the performances AND whatever they had on the mini stage while in the Dealers room and video game room

It was basically one big airplane hanger that they sectioned off

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

oh nooooooooooooooo ohno oh no oh on
zenkai was like that for one year because we were desperate with nowhere else to go for a year, but they kept panels away from main events
that horrible

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-02*

Yeah so there were times when you couldn't hear the person speaking right next to you

It makes me not wanna go next year

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-02*

someone didn't think things through. yikes. i wonder if they have anyone in charge or if the college students are free to do as they please?
like kotoricon is also a college con but dr. glenn controls it with an iron fist and everything has to be run by her, even though the club runs it together

**Bill** - *2018-09-03*

I now have a backpack, the same I used for college, filled with four bottles of liquor, two flasks, and camera gear.

If I stuck my macbook in there, I'd be the perfect college student.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-03*

Lmao 4 bottles? Whatchu got? Strawberry vodka, some type of bourbon I'm assuming

**Bill** - *2018-09-03*

The vodka and grenadine for the strawberry sunrises, woodford reserve for flask bourbon and the bottle kurtis got for my birthday for sipping.

It worked out surprisingly well.

Using the backpack I mean.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-03*

Nice, now you just need a really long straw and Yu can walk around drinking it from your back pack

**Bill** - *2018-09-03*

naaah. That's what the flasks are for.

This is overkill, I actually expect to not like the strawberry sunrises, but it's for the heck of it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-03*

~~ill just drink the vodka~~

**Bill** - *2018-09-03*

welcome to.

CCE is best vacation, cause friends and hot tubs and just...

ugh.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-04*

ooo so thats what an old fashioned is

**Bill** - *2018-09-04*

Usually has fruit in it.

Cherry.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-04*



It can have cherry but more traditionally has orange rind apparently

**Bill** - *2018-09-04*

Cherry in it. The rind is orange ye.

Go figure though, I've never had one with sugar I don't think.

It's a drink that's got a lot of variety to it.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-04*

**Bill** - *2018-09-10*

Heard rumor, needed confirmation. Thanks Mawisa.

How did I miss that though. Damn. Off my game.

Everyone watch for CCE‚Äôs announcement of dates. Last year I could book when they announced the dates, not even the room block.

So fuck you Next, you only posted the block announcement on Facebook. I put up with notifications from all your stupid promotional tweets and this is how you repay me?

Potential meme shots:

* cardboard box that‚Äôs decorated like a ticket machine I can punch

The last one is my favorite.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-12*

Oh wait no you can't cosplay hazel

That give you a Canon reason to hit Tom and I

**Bill** - *2018-09-12*

I wouldn‚Äôt do that!

~~it gives you a canon reason to hammer time me~~

I‚Äôve got the pilot boi outfit too. Still need to fix the leather chaps length but it worked.

there's a cosplay event at tokyo dome city this weekend i'm considering going to. but maybe not. i overheard some girls at school talking about going to kamakura and i might steal their plans.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-13*

what kamakura? üòÆ

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

oo it's south of tokyo. i went there once, it's got a famous hiking route and lots of old temples, and enoshima is a nearby island
one of the most famous things there is this buddha but there are way bigger buddha elsewhere in the country

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-13*

WHOA thats really cool

omw

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-13*

i wish

that would be sweet

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-13*

OH IVE SEEN THAT

How I saw it was funny tho

I was randomly.clicking around Japan in Google Earth looking for.photo hotspots

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

YOOO
tom's already been to kamakura

did you find any good hotspots

i've been trying to think of places in jersey that would make good photoshoot locations but idk man

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

I've got a map of those.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

that one quaker house but unless you're one of the trained reenactors they don't let u touch the stuffs
oo what's on the map

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

http://www.thelittlethingswemiss.us/article/2018/02/27/photoshoot-map.html

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

eyy

fancy color coding

*because what are we, animals?*

why those churches in particular?

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

Haven't been to most of them. Not sure where you're talking about.

Color coding is for knowing which charge and which dont.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

there was a church but it was way south like down the shore. then i clicked on a park and thought it was a church because of the preview image.

i could probably ask sofia to get us borrow her restaurant before it opens thursday of animenext or at some time people are around atlantic city/margate

assuming they have no events

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

Ooooh, I remember that. I saw it from the taxi when I was in AC January. I thought it looked cool is all.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

ooo

rowan used to have a bunch of retro stuff around, didn't it. or did it get torn down.

look biru it's you

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

the historical section of haddonfield always has a really nice christmas setup. like peddler's village but it's actually a residential-y area and the whole street is lit up

~~actually, wouldn't bunce make a really good photoshoot location~~

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

academic characters, european/fantasy world characters, old fashioned or roman-esque characters

characters that'd sit in a park

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

Bunce has that god awful trapazoid desks, that'd look weird for japanese styles class. Big windows would help though. 

Fantasy... maybe the main steps? ditto for old fashion and roman. I dunno if there's much outside the steps for the old time feel. It's a old building, but the interior has been pretty modern.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

o i didn't think we'd be allowed inside. *the trapezoid desks*. ah memories.
ye the main steps are basically where the party's at yehaw

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

You don't still have your rowan ID?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

i do

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

Me and Andoru do, we can sneak on easy peasy.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

do those still work

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

probably not, but a security guy won't complain.

Also, until we start to look like 30 year olds no one will question us around a college. It's college.

Like, anytime we went to princeton no one even stopped to look at us.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

nothing unusual about nerds in costume

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

Every college has an anime club after all.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

Kurtis DID cosplay Jurassic park.

MOOD

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*

if y'all ever come to wildwood it's got stuff. arcades. amusement parks. beach.

an aquarium would be cool. they let cosplayers into the aquarium on acosta days.

also i know ur favorite retro place is shutting down ye? but wildwood is super retro and there's one place called the Doo Wop Experience

oh there's also an airplane museum with lots of military planes

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

Blue Chatterbox!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-13*



omg a few years ago during the kite festival they had a life-sized Toothless kite flying around to promote the httyd movie. a hiccup cosplay would've been perfect

**Bill** - *2018-09-13*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-14*

YOU EXPERIENCED IT

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-14*

I did! I barely remember it tho it would be cool to see again.

**Bill** - *2018-09-14*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-14*

oof

we're camping that weekend D:

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2018-09-14*

Rip I mean we could probably grab em for you though

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-14*

Oh nicu

Yeah you could grab em

Wait we're aren't camping then ?

That's the week before

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-14*

oh shit

opps

**Bill** - *2018-09-16*

I wonder if we can do with the Kalahari like we do with Hershey. You charge everything, *everything* to the room for the explicit purpose of making the hotel clear on how much you spend. They look at it and then suddenly like talking to you.

Booked two rooms at the Sheraton out of room block as a worst case. Surprised we could, last year Next booked out the whole con.

It's 331 a night, which is *gross*, but there was no deposit so I can cancel it when we get into the block.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-16*

OOF yea hopefully the room block is better

**Bill** - *2018-09-16*

However, the marriott SPG merger finished so I merged those accounts. Between the Next stays and last year's other cons, I'm silver elite now.

Time to see how to make use of THOSE perks.

*Give me a damn operator, you can't just dangle late checkout privileges and priority booking numbers in front of me and not explain them to me*

So if I get to Gold status, there's pretty much a guaranteed 2pm late check out.

That requires 15 more nights by January.

We can request it now that I'm silver tho.

Kalahri: Have confirmed the rate exists. The block is closed and the woman said they can't book regularly that far out yet.

Didn't get a hold of the rate info though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-16*

Yea I tried looking at rates online last night too

I don't think you gonna a get 15 more by January tho üòÆ

**Bill** - *2018-09-16*

Nah. But, with the full 5 circuit (Katsu Zenkai Next Ota CCE) we'll hit 25 next year and go gold.

oh wait maybe not... It's hilton for Ota and CCE doesn't count.

Gold unlikely then.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

has this been posted

o someone did a super cute beach akko

and there was a **double engagement** at the cells at work photoshoot? where two couples proposed at the same time. con proposals gettin out of hand

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Oh, I think I saw that Akko. Tres kawaii.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

tfw ur the first cosplayer to arrive at an event

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Katsu at 7am.

> attempts to get rooms transferred to the room block for next 2 hours early.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

how's that workin' for ya

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Group reservations chick *definitely* has had a few people call her already.

"Nope, wait till 12, thanks, bye"

Now to try central.

*woooow*

Central reservations is hanging up as soon as I get the person.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

wot

did you even say anything or did the person just hang up?

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

The hold music stops, dial tone, then hang up.

=/

Called in house reservations again to ask about it, and they said nothing is wrong. Sounds like the same woman too, whiiiich means unless I can get through to central I have to deal with her later and she sounds like a hardass.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

oof

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Marriott merger ain't coming in clutch either.

so we wait.

sigh.

Anyone desk jobbing, watch for the block code to go up on Next's social media. I can try and do it online if I get stuck in a queue on the phone.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

i'm organizing kitkats but i'm good at refreshing stuff

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

i have notifications on

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

as it gets closer refresh the page every so often.

I hate most SNS notifications. They have too many hidden stipulations, they stop if you get too many at once, or they only notify to your tablet and not your computer, etc.

If I want spam, I want *spam*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

u guys want some alcoholic kitkats
i've eaten most of what i collected because my sister only wants one of each but I'm not eating any of the ones with alcohol so i have many alcoholic kitkats

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

course!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

oki. they're mostly rum raisin that's super popular for some reason.

and sake

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

üòÆ

that sound tasty

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

the one i'm holding is rum raisin, almond, and cranberries. fancy kitkat. the choclate berry almond one is pretty good so i assume this is like that

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Tried central again, still hangs up on you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

time to file a complaint

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

With any luck it'll trip other people up so we get our rooms without issue.

and yet another con with a shitshow for booking.

start watching for that damn code.

Why does Next want me to hate it *so* much.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

if u get a ping from me here don't even read it just go go go

unless there's a code involved then i'll include that unless you saw it already then just gog og o go

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Got through too soon.

This is annoying as hell.

*How do you line up early for a phone call*

Mawisa use your connections to get us rooms earlyyyy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

it is funny seeing a hotel bedroom turned into a buffet because that's how staff gets their sustenance

the green thing on animenext's banner is making me really uncomfortable especially because it has a fork

WHY IS IT SO DIFFERENT ON FACEBOOK

are they different creatures





**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

OH NO

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

sorry you can punch me in revenge i'll brace myself for it and cover myself in foam armor with a hard outer shell to protect me and even if it makes things worse when i tumble down at least it'll give me a false sense of security

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

alright, I booked twice.

Tried to do deluxe, that didn't fire.

And the first one some how didn't require an *email* so I have no idea what the confirmation number is.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

it'll come to you in a dream

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Dunno. Usually suspects I assume.

Suddenly feel like I should have booked a third though.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

it sold out allready üò≠

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-17*

Which con dis for?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

next

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Next.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-17*

Lmao

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Yeah, everything but Kings.

Though techically I just released two rooms so...

Three *is* sort of overkill tho.

~~Even if I did it for Zenkai~~

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

ok so we have:
2 rooms for Katsu
3 for Zenkia
2 for Next and 
hopefully 1 big one for CCE?

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

and 2 rooms for Ota.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

THATS THE OTHER ONE

i knew tere was one more

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Suite king rooms though, with a sofabed.

*They moved the damn opening date*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

yeaaaa thats right

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Once CCE is booked we're lit for next year.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

so king could hold like 3 people? and 2 on the sofa, so 10 peeps?

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

suite. can probably hold the usual 6.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

i can fit under a table

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

yea if they slepe on floor i guess

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

dibs on under the table at next

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

mawisa no

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

but it's roomier than most underneath hotel desks do u wanna fight for it

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

King suite should suppose air mattress, king, and sofa. That‚Äôs 6. I think Jakes room was the same type.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

nah jakes was like a penthouse

cuz it had like 2 separate bedrooms

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

omg the desk is an actual table you could fit like 3 people under there

in a king

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

what hotel are we at for ota?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

I‚Äôll check when I get back.

Embassy suites?

Hilton.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-17*

**Bill** - *2018-09-17*

Otakon's portal sucks.

The Jessies got to the Sheraton as well.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-17*

o we gonna be on same floor again

**Bill** - *2018-09-19*

lol

That'd be something.

Next has a limited RWBY fam presence tho.

Tried Kalahari again. This girl told me that the contract isn't finalized for group rates.

Maybe CCE is trying to get more discounts for the sunday trouble?

I mean. That is like, passive aggressive to the *nines*.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-19*

*drama! drama! drama!*

**Bill** - *2018-09-20*

I'm getting a gopro by next CCE. Waterproof, small, can handle the 'hanging out but still a photographer' section of the con.

Saw Jake's and I was like 'genius'.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-20*

Where'd he wear his

**Bill** - *2018-09-20*

he just held it.

You can use it as a camera.

like?

Going to be cheaper than water/humidity proof enclosures for a dslr, can tell you that much.

Will CCE's dates finalized I'm going to have to call Kalahari again to see if I can snek in early.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-20*

Oh I missed this entire chat yesterday

Huh

Marisa can cuddle with Jess, it'll be fine. I'll just take my half of the bed <:lenny:395307171539189760>

Audrey left BNE.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-21*

whaaa why

was she embarassed by her father

**Bill** - *2018-09-21*

I mean, she was never very talkative, the age gap, and her Dad.

But it's a little sad.

I really wish discord notified when people leave server.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-21*

yeah i was just wondering that. i wonder when it happened and if her dad knows, and if he'd leave if he found out

**Bill** - *2018-09-21*

Her Dad has been more involved with us than she has.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-21*

which i've also found a bit odd/interesting but whatever floats ya boat

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-21*

i mean shes?14? it might be a little hard to relate to us for her

**Bill** - *2018-09-21*

ye, said the age gap.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-21*

but outright leaving the server. gasp.

maybe there's a bot that can sense when someone leaves a server that you can put in a hidden channel

nsa-style

**Bill** - *2018-09-21*

I entirely could rig something like that.

but effort.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-22*

the tickets for the cosplay show i got were for after the con, which ended at five, and then the show was at the con at 6:30. it's weird how that worked. but the people in line by me spoke english and were from malaysia so it wasn't an hour and a half of sitting in silence.

also wow that was better than any US masquerade we gotta learn from these guys who wants to do a masq skit next year

also there was a nier skit with 2B, 9S, and A2 that was super cool i didn't know you guys came to the con

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-22*

there were 2 nier skits and in the first one the 2b dropped her sword i felt so bad for her but she looked flawless just like u

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-22*

I was going to say that was me until you said flawless

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-22*

OH AND i got approached by like 6 members of the press omg. one was from the UK branch of CBS news, one was for NIntendo Life, one was a part of Tokyo Game Show staff, and i dunno what the others were for i think i got some business cards from them but they were just like "press, ok?" and was like "yeAH üëå "

oh gamespot. british cbs owns gamespot apparently

OH Catherine is getting a sequel? or an anime? it was unclear but there was a huge catherine display

This guy I met today at Tokyo Game Show and I are friends now and he‚Äôs going to Katsucon because he lives in Maryland and I was like ‚ÄúEYYY SEE U AT KATSU‚Äù <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138> 
Also he‚Äôs a literal giant and I feel like I‚Äôve seen him at cons before. He had a circle of Japanese guys around him and when he flexed they all went ‚Äúsugoooooi!!‚Äù

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-09-23*

Omg that's amazing

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-23*

The girl I was with was looking for him because they were friends. We kept walking in circles and she didn‚Äôt know what he was cosplaying. I assumed she was searching for a short girl because that‚Äôs 99% of cosplayers and it‚Äôd be understandably difficult to find one in particular. Nope she was looking for the 7‚Äô tall bodybuilder. Ok.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-23*

Hahaha that's great tho

Do you know his handle

His skin tone reminds me of kamistry lmao

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-23*

Ya he‚Äôs @whodigiya on twitter

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-09-23*

Oof twitter

Not worth

Oo and insta too

Oo he cosplays all fighting game characters I've seen this guy

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-23*

O ya u right that‚Äôs his insta
Twitter is huge in japan. That‚Äôs the first thing anyone asks for at a con. Instagram seems more hipstery

As much as twitter confuses me, it‚Äôs probably a better platform overall than Instagram.

Oh my god I scrolled back to copy pasta a crazy marisa story for BNE. I found one, but it‚Äôs just normal marisa.

So Dave is going to cosplay a rattley boi and show up at the Mangolooloo meetup Leanna style right?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-24*

this is it this sums up all of TGS day 2

also i discovered that the guys don't have to flip their skirts when they leave the changing rooms so guys can totally show off their underwear. lewd.

girls can wear bikinis or swimsuits, some were *super* minimal clothing as long as they have tights on underneath (there were a couple of shuten douji's) (because nude tights totally help with modesty or something). but if you have a skirt of any kind, you **must** have shorts on under it and they check at the changing room exit.
surprised this isn't a big cliche in yuri manga. maybe the mangaka just don't know about it.

there was also an FGO abigail in basically a nude bodysuit and a ton of girls just put tape on their chests but *heaven forbid a bra strap is visible u will be permabanned*

Was thinking about ANYC, how did you go into the city last year Georgia?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-24*

Da trainnnn

**Bill** - *2018-09-24*

from where?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-09-24*

New Brunswick

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-25*

imagine anime wrestling but the attendees are allowed to just enter willy nilly and beat each other up in a free for all

WOAH how did we miss THIS trainwreck???

reportedly, a group called Geeks 5 Ever had some panels scheduled, but they were unable to make it to the convention and cancelled several weeks prior. There was a miscommunication somewhere and the panels were never taken off the schedule. So somehow, a dude in full nazi attire took over the fanfiction panel by pretending to be in charge of it and made all sorts of horrible jokes and did the stuff in the above image.

whatever staff member who was notified first handled it totally wrongly by saying they couldn't do anything about it. they might've been new, or a gopher, or a different department but even if they didn't know what to do they didn't get the training necessary to contact the right people who *could* stop it.

the guy wasn't even kicked out of the con, just asked to change.

also after this, journalists started doing investigations into anime matsuri and found it was run by a bunch of people with sexual assault charges. what a goldmine.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-25*

the hats

con: friend is making me go to a chiba cosplay event on the same day as the telecom cosplay event
pro: more people will go to the telecom event so maybe acosta will be less crowded? the chiba center has a lot of nice backdrops which would be great to use if it's not crowded.

on archive there are 111 people saying they're going to telecom and 60 saying theyre going to chiba a! so that's neat i guess

come and pose inside the **c o l o r f u l b o x e s**

Also I wanna make some nice fallout stuff for Katsu

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

Was katsu‚Äôs ball changed to Saturday? ü§î if so why they do that

**Bill** - *2018-09-29*

Ye. It wasn't a popular choice.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

Yeah that‚Äôs so strange. Is it before the masquerade? Or after the masq? It‚Äôd have to be after right unless they split cosplay into two departments. Or is it in a different room than main events

**Bill** - *2018-09-29*

Main events is connected to the balcony with da gazebo?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

Naw it‚Äôs upstairs from registration, one floor above the gazebo level I believe

Unless they moved that too

Did they actually use the ballroom for the ball for once

**Bill** - *2018-09-29*

Nah. It was same floor as reg.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

ü§î wot

Is reg still in that big room that kinda looks like a garage

Next to the exhibition hall?

**Bill** - *2018-09-29*

think so. Farthest room on the left after going into con area.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-09-29*

I asked for a pic from some ouran gun club cosplayers there once and they immediately went into a bdsm pose.

~~is he scrolling through our backlogs?~~

I got the name of a karaoke place not in new york, it's byob so Georgia won't be banned, and it's a little over an hour away. 6 bucks an hour.

Downside, it's pretty *close* to new york, so it's going to be like going to CPAC per say.

*Upside*, it's a few miles from Mitsuwa Marketplace so we can go there as part of the trip.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-02*

huh thats not bad

**Bill** - *2018-10-04*

Yeah. ~~It's not optional this is happening~~

Sooo I have no idea how this flannel squad is put together.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-04*

isn't it just whoever wears flannel

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-04*

So it's everyone

**Bill** - *2018-10-05*

Sketchy.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-05*

ok im officially a no go on ANYC

not just cause its the weekend after fallout comes out, but its the weekend before another round of midterms

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-05*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-05*

Mmmm 75% confirmed

**Bill** - *2018-10-07*

Only 6 people went to the pumpkin shoot. üòè

Oof. Hate to admit it, but Casey's halloween cards look cool. Not in the 'i want one' sense, but in the way they were designed.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-07*

Not much designing to it but ye

**Bill** - *2018-10-07*

PFFT this is hilarious

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-07*

im laughING SO HARD

PLZ PUT THAT IN BNE

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-07*

OMG

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-07*

finally. a sophisticated hall party for us adults.

Does that still exist because it‚Äôs not a public event. 
Give us the link OP

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Actually though how many tags have you gotten from the flannel fam nonsense?

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-08*

Oh now it's nonsense? üòõ

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-08*

everything ive been tagged on is up in the flannel fam highlight

and that highlight is gettin preeeetty long

22 separate people have used the flannel fam hashtag or in some way @'d me

**Bill** - *2018-10-08*

Have you been following the tag?

Can you do that?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-08*

nah cause other people have used the hashtag before me

it was a pre-existing hashtag with like 1k posts

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

~~I started using it you know~~

Still, lot of tags. Probably better than people going ‚Äúnice‚Äù in replies.

> me: we should get more photographers in BNE, I can‚Äôt shoot everyone

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

You're the hot commodity tho ~~I'mma just lose my place in BNE and be forgotten about~~.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

billiam no thats silly

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

you may think so.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

theyre not replacing you because your friendship is not replaceable

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

uh huh.

,...

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

some days im like damn

there are so many hot pyrrhas in the world

and i am an awkward noodle

everyone will someday see this and like them more

but thats not true because people dont think that way

and people enjoy me for my cosplay, but also my ‚ú® sparkling personality ‚ú®

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

What‚Äôs a sparkling personality like.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

its a metaphor

what im really saying is that people enjoy you for you

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

Sure. On another day I‚Äôd agree with you.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

My staff application for Zenkai was given to safety even though dizzy said I had a guaranteed cosplay spot. üòø

I would‚Äôve reapplied for exhibits as my second choice but that‚Äôs filled up I think

They already filled the cosplay spot because they had less openings then they thought. Dizzy confirmed I would‚Äôve been guaranteed but she had less openings than she thought and she already filled it. üò≠

they sent her 3 applications and mine wasn't one of them. i don't think i can do safety i'm one of the most unimposing people and i won't be able to cosplay

what costumes can be worn with a t-shirt over them

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

Dizzy sucks.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

NO dizzy is great it's not her fault. she didn't get my application. it's whoever is in charge of staff apps that messed up. dizzy even said she'd message kiwi to ensure i get a spot in safety so i'm not tossed over to AMVs and stuck in a room all day.

well i might be stuck in a room all day in safety. it depends. but at least it'll be a public room not full of people sitting around in the dark.

i'm just shell shocked because i didn't think I wouldn't get the cosplay position. i figured we were more organized than this, especially since i sent my app months ago. maybe i sent it too early? even though the form had been publicly available for a while?

and exhibits is full so i can't get my old job there hhhh

pros: maybe i'll get a radio? doubtful but maybe.

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

It sucks cause you can't hang out with us.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

cons: i am physically incapable of shouting so if someone pulls a gun or starts something i can't yell at them

ya i can I only have to work 24-26 hours over the weekend <:lenny:395307171539189760>

i asked dizzy if i could enter the hcc if i'm not working cosplay and she didn't respond so i assume that's a ye *because nothing says otherwise* <:lenny:395307171539189760>

oh fudge. i mentioned i wanted to see the masquerade and then dizzy said she'd talk to kiwi. they might place me at main event security. yelling at lines and checking badges all day ehjkmnbvc

also high chance of being dealer security because BoJo's the head of that

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

This all sucks.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

yeah we can't have a group of all aces running the 18+ events again

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-09*

:/

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

i thought we meant discord dizzy this whole time

HUH

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

*dizzy how could you*

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-09*

Oh no! Maybe someone will drop?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

dizzy lizzy! she's in charge of zenkai's cosplay exhibit and the founder of the cosplay exhibition!

maybe but it's doubtful. only in the most extraordinary of circumstances can you drop

https://www.facebook.com/DizzyLizzyCostuming/

that dizzy

i'm feelin' sad.
but they do the staff schedule around the same time as the public schedule so if there's any events or times i should take off for let me know. maybe i can make the ball this year. assuming safety takes me, (~~what if they don't oh noo~~) there shouldn't be any events i'm forced to work? unless i'm put in main events safety or something but if anything the chances are high of being placed in dealer's safety. i think. meaning i'll primarily be working when the dealer's hall is open.

dizzy reminded me to send in an application and i told her i already did, that should've tipped her off that something was wrong etaysdtjkyjhgf

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

~~why don't you not have them take you?~~

Take a year off and go back next year, and spend this year hanging with us.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

oh the cosplay spot was filled by another returning staffer, so it's not like anyone new is joining. maybe she did get my application and only had one spot to fill and gave it to the veteran worker.
but then i wouldn't get a free room and free food $$$$
honestly i don't think i'd know how to enjoy zenkaikon not as a staffer ü§î I've staffed it since before they moved to this location. i might accidentally wind up walking into the staff suite or confusing myself, and people would probably make me help out anyway.

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

I *guesssss*

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

i can still hang out. the con is longer than 9 hours a day

i doubt y'all'd want me around constantly, y'all need a marisa break

if i'm safety i likely won't be bound to the cosplay area like last year. it depends on what duty i'm doing but safety are generally more free roaming

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

We want you around constantly, yes.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

until the 90th time i dab and do finger guns to point at something. then it's just regret all around.

do you think they'd fire me if i dabbed to show people directions

if i start working at 7 though and go all day, i could be free after 4 or 5pm.
or i could schedule 1-2 hours breaks in between working and work on and off
the schedule is very flexible depending on where i'm put

i just have to fulfill 24~+ hours

oh no. everyone is going to talk to kiwi. but they're not telling me what they're gonna talk to kiwi *about*. why this.

ok i spoke with BoJo, she said security is super simple. if I'm on her team I'll just be stationed outside the dealer's hall. if I'm on ilene's team (where a lot of younger staffers get sent) i'll be patrolling the con. I *will* get a cool radio.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-09*

THEY GON GET THIS STRAIGT?

NO ALL MARISA ALL THE TIME

NO SPACES

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

basically i won't be confined to the cosplay building and i'll have freedom and a cool radio and I can cosplay as long as I wear the staff t-shirt over it when i'm on duty <:dab_chunni:370384480613040138>

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-09*

All mawisa all da time!

[does the worm for 24 hours straight]

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-09*

Yea!

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

aside from big rushes like the friday dealer's line I should have a lot of free time while on duty. assumedly. that's assumedly a real world.

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

How far are you from chestnut hill <@!245270932602486784> ?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

Just barely over an hour

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

That's way more managable to do in a night.

If you were going to go just for the night... I may have a proposition for you.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-10-09*

owo?

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

Like I said to Erik, I wouldn't want to go if I have to drive back. If you were going to head home afterwards, I could come by you in the afternoon, bum a ride to the crawl, and would probably have to crash at your house. It's... alright, entirely in my benefit, but if you *happen* to be doing all the things that make the plan work...

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

by crawl you couldn't possibly ever mean the *bar* crawl

**Bill** - *2018-10-09*

<@!245270932602486784> leeemme know, cause I needed plans that weekend.

**Are you Elfriede of the dark?** - *2018-10-09*

He's actually just gonna crawl really aggressively

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-09*

get some knee pads or your pants will stain by crawling on the grass

unless you're goin for that grass-stained pants look

bringing it back in fashion

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Oof Katsu costs.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

Only five people in room?

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I'm estimating 4 people staying 4 nights, and 5 people staying 3.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

O so 9 people in two rooms? Nine can fit in one room <:lenny:395307171539189760>

I can‚Äôt math

Seven

Wait

Nine

MATH SUCKS

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

9 people, two rooms, we don't sardine pack Marisa.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

That‚Äôs weird

How do you have four people in a room for a con that‚Äôs so empty üôÄ

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

The sussex locals don't travel there and the rest of the Rowan bois don't either.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

Who they?

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Locals are Justin and Rayna. Rowan bois are John and Aaron.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

(who they)

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

justin is our mine and toms friend from college, rayna is his gf, and also our friend

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

(I‚Äôm just pulling legs here and not being serious) bUT 9 people in a room is hardly sardine packing. 11 maybe. But nine is fine.

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

Wait.

You were never serious about putting 9 people in a room?

Like, in the past?

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

No that‚Äôs real. Nine is the average usually.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm shocked

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

mawisa i room pack master, i am room pack bb ~~i hate room packing and get really overwhelmed with everyones stuff everywhere~~

~~our room last year was 7 people and that was like my max~~

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

Jess that just means we need *more room packing*

Plus we‚Äôll have a balcony. That can fit like three more people.

**Aldus and Heaven Too (Jess)** - *2018-10-12*

üò≠

**Bill** - *2018-10-12*

I won't put 7 in unless three people are sharing a single bed.

**one two (Nok)ri four (Marisa)** - *2018-10-12*

How many did Courtney‚Äôs room have for Otakon? All I remember about that is the annoying aldus cosplayer

alright I bought my tickets to everything. Geekdom ANYC and Katsu.

Seriously jealous of fucking Hunter. He may shop a good amount, but his composition is good and inspired and he has tools for to compensate for poor light, he‚Äôs pushy about shoots *but that some how doesn‚Äôt get met with no‚Äôs*, has apparently half a dozen people from BNE in shoot plans with him, all the time in the world (apparently?), and he‚Äôs got a more conventional popular style so everyone will like him more for photos, especially if it‚Äôs free. ~~They‚Äôll probably like him more too because the fact that I do free photos has to have formed at least a few of the friendships i have in BNE; I‚Äôm not that likable.~~ 

So. React salt or whatever but I‚Äôm venting.

That's only because Hunter is really excited, plus he's planning it with all the "last minute spur of the moment people who have time on thier hands."

Meg: takes only two classes

Casey: doesn‚Äôt go to work or school

Hal: Poli sci major taking only 4 classes

Hunter is LITERALLY asking all the people that are most available

**Bill** - *2018-10-17*

I‚Äôm not looking to be logical, I‚Äôm *venting*.

Just because I have reason not to be jealous doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt be.

> birds from finding Nemo but instead of mine they‚Äôre saying shoots
> the birds are Hunter

I may have a decidedly short fuse this week, but it‚Äôs *amazing* how everything his says is annoying me. I won‚Äôt say anything because I know I have biases influencing me, but it‚Äôs impressive.

Reshares to BNE and watches fire start

Lmao they are gonna get shit on

Besides in Japan 16 is totally an acceptable age

They are cartoon characters and they don't look completely like children so I'd say it's fine. That'd be like saying that with Naruto like. Bruh

If they are made to look like ten year olds that's when you're maybe crossing a line.
