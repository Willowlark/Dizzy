Noticing that fellow wolf laguz has stepped onto the scene Aldus turns to him saying. "Hello kinsman, that seems to be quite the crate you have there, would you like some help in setting it down? I mean , if this is where you are going"

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-04*

"Oh! Thank you kinsman, that would be appreciated.  It's nice to see a friendly face in all this hustle and bustle."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

"Ah yes, I've only been out of Wynne a few weeks but am missing my clan already, although I do have to say I don't miss waking up to an icicle hanging off my nose." He says with a short laugh and a smile

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-04*

TIkur smiles and with a short laugh he says "Ha, I know how you feel, that feeling will always be there but you'll always have them with you" as he motions to his heart.  "My name is Tikur by the way, why would be yours friend?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

"Aldus Larian, nice to meet you! Now where can we put this crate to get it off your hands?"

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-04*

"Well I was supposed to deliver it to the shopkeeper here, has potion ingredients from an older lady on the outskirts of town.  Her wagon broke on the way in so I offered to bring it for her." Tikur looks at the shopkeeper and notices she is engaging some customers "I guess we could bring it to the side of her stall and wait till shes done, dont want to be rude though." He says with a chuckle.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

"Yes, it does seem to be quite the popular locale at the moment. I don't see the harm in setting it down along side her though, just to get the weight off. Then you can explain once the line disperses"  he offers

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-04*

"That sounds like a good idea, if you want to just grab the otherside of it well set it on down."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

"Sounds good!" He says. With a jerk of his head Aldus shakes his long brown-grey hair behind his shoulder and grabs the  opposite end of the crate. The two walk it over to the side of the stall and set it down.

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-04*

WIth a sigh of relief as they set it down Tikur streches his back and says "Ahh, feels good to set that down finally.  Thank you again friend, now to wait till she is done with the line."  He sits on the coner of the crate and pulls off his pack and starts rummaging through "I have some snacks that the old woman was kind enough to give me, would you like some while we wait? "

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-10-04*

"Well I've never been one to pass up a free snack!, thanks!" After the two have had a quick snack together , Aldus returns to the line to await his turn

**Tikur (Kurtis)** - *2017-10-04*

As Aldus goes back in line Tikur pulls out a book and starts to read a look of joy pops on his face as hey mabey a possible new friend...

Location: Tyndall Tower Library
Asided from: Tyndall Tower's Entrance Hall.
Characters: Itory, Afina
```

Itory brushes the first floor library door open with his right hand and steps inside. Placing his feet together and clasping his hands behind his back, he gives a short bow to the lady of the house. 

"Milady Tyndall." he says as he gives her a quick once over, taking note of the closed book on the table. "As you may have heard, you have three callers this afternoon. One young woman who says she only that she wishes for an audience with you; another who is looking for you specifically." he hesitates for a moment. "Both are laguz, and neither stated their alliance." He rolls his shoulders once.

"The final caller appears to be the one you've been expecting Milady, the Eraian messenger Professor Carya told you about it." he says. A mark of his experience; he holds his own opinion until asked. He watches his princess, waiting for her input.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-08*

Afina raised her eyebrows, mouth agape. "The messenger? He's here?" she asked incredulously. Afina began to pace back and forth in front of the desk. "I was wondering if Professor Carya had forgotten about that after all this time. Oh yes of course let him in and-". She hesitated, pausing in her tracks. "And you said there were two more visitors? Who wish to speak to ME?" She pointed to herself, brows furrowed. "That's awfully abnormal, to say the least. And a bit suspicious." 

She folded her arms, leaning back against the desk. "Well, the smart decision would be to dismiss them. But. I AM curious as to why they wish to speak to me specifically. Curiosity killed the cat laguz, but one must never forget that satisfaction brought it back. Is there any other information you got from them? How did they seem? Did it look like they came to... you know." She asked, shifting from foot to foot nervously. Her father had warned about assassins and ruffians before she had left home; she never truly considered the possibility until now.

**Bill** - *2017-10-08*

Itory nods slowly, approvingly. Much like her father, Afina rarely makes a decision on the spot. 

"The wolf laguz, Atalantia, says she's traveled a long distance. Being a wolf laguz, and by her statement that she's traveled through Callora, I believe we can infer she hails from Wynne." He pauses. When he resumes his tone is judgemental. "She is specifically a symbol of alliance from you. That should be indicative of her disposition." 

"The knight is formally Knight-lieutenant Elfreide Faun. He is, as expected of a ranking officer, to the point." Itory continues. Itory rolls his shoulder lightly.

"As for the cat laguz... she spoke not of herself, but of the urgency to Knight Elfreide's visit. Her dress is not that of a noble, nor that of a ruffian. Beyond that, I cannot say more on her." Itory frowns slightly before shrugging the same shoulder from before. "She is... suspicious Milady. Knowledge is power, and she reveals none."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-08*

Afina nodded slowly, thoughtfully mulling over this information. "Clearly the messenger has clearance; I've been expecting this letter for a while now and Eraia is a trusted kingdom at the moment. They especially wouldn't want to provoke a fight with Laera, and by extension, Callora, by sending an assassin for me. Especially when we have one of THEIR most prominent scholars teaching in OUR kingdom at the moment." She smiled. Though often compared to her father, Afina was far more like her mother when it came to altercations; less a fighter, more a tactician. 

"And the Wynne wolf laguz. Also clearly no threat. Diplomacy still exists nowadays, even if the news gives no indication of it. And Laera is in a good position should fighting ever break out. And even in peacetime, our library and scholars are a huge advantage." She grinned. "Why wouldn't a nation want to ally with Laera?" Clearly, Afina was biased when it came to national pride. 

"Finally, the cat laguz. A knight wouldn't need an escort, especially one primarily unarmed..." she drummed her fingers on the table, deep in thought. "Itory, what is the back up plan should things turn sour in Tyndall Tower? Of course I have light magic, but. At the moment, that's a secret between the Tyndall family, it's scholars, and it's... staff," she said hesitantly, purposely avoiding the word "servants". The king said that phrase was derogatory, but she didn't see how. Even still, it was best not to offend those in her company. A lesson she learned the hard way.

**Bill** - *2017-10-08*

"There is a hidden exit in the back of the tower, accessible from the first and third floors Milady." Itory says. "There is always the option of turning them away. Surely the Knight-lieutenant would step in where there to be trouble."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-08*

Afina grabbed the book off the desk and walked over to the far end of the room, biting her thumbnail nervously. "Alright," she sighed, settling in a high-backed chair by the Laera tapestry. She flipped open the book and nimbly dog-earred a page for emergency reference. "Send them in."

**Bill** - *2017-10-08*

Itory pauses. "You'll meet with all of them at once?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-09*

She shrugged with a smile. "Why not? They've probably already become great friends whilst waiting outside together."

**Bill** - *2017-10-09*

Itory looks pointedly at the lady of the house, but only shrugs his left shoulder in comment. He bows again before stepping out of the library door, back towards the front of the tower.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

Afina exhaled, shaking her head. Life was much rougher outside of Laera than she thought. She stroked the leather binding of the book. Maybe after such a monumental decision such as that of a potential exchange of familial approval and a visit to Eraia, she would finally be allowed home to take her rightful place as inheritor to the throne.

[END ASIDE]

The dinner was intricate; Itory had clearly outdone himself in his preparations. Laera had a fondness for white meats and veggies, and it seemed he had responded in kind. A large chicken sat in the center of the table, surrounded by platters of vegetables. Afina took a large helping of chicken before clearing her throat. The table had been mostly silent until now. "So... now that we'll be traveling together, I do believe we should all talk about ourselves. Who wants to go first?" She asked bluntly. Tyndalls were not ones to beat around the bush.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*Eldfriede attempts to remember his table manners that he learned as a child of a noble family.*

"Well, since you know all our names already I dont believe I need to reiterate, but I am of the Faun family in Eraia, we have a bit of power and wealth but nothing compared to your family Lady Tyndell." 
*he glaces around the table*
"Ah its been a while since I've had such a lavish meal. I've been on military rations for a while now and it turns out they don't exactly care all that much about what family your from when it comes to such pleasantries."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

Atalantia looked wide eyed towards the table of food; she couldn't remember the last time she had such a huge meal. Even though she was able to appreciate the Laera delicacy, nothing could compare to the taste and texture of the food prepared by Atalantia's tribe. 

After a moment of displaying appreciation for the food Atalantia finally speaks, "I  am from a laguz wolf pack that is known as the Uinpeng tribe. While I am of no noble status, one could easily compare my role in my tribe as equally just. I am referred to as the Ultimate Alpha of my pack."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

"Oh!" Afina exclaimed. "Another noble! It's been so long since I've had contact with another. A pleasure! And yes, I'm glad that I'm able to share the food of my culture with you. It's... well. Comfort food especially." Afina nodded. "I have to admit that I'm not familiar with many laguz traditions, including the hierarchy. Laera has always been accepted of the laguz, especially with my father's 'open arms open minds' doctrine. It surely sounds interesting though." This was a rare instance where Afina could admit she didn't have knowledge of a particular matter. If only for the reason that she wished to be taught more. "What do they eat where you all are from?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

*Atalantia responds to Afina's statements*
"Truthfully I wouldn't expect nobility to know of our ways, and it is often problematic for our people. However, we are relatively open to teaching people of our customs if they have the open mind and respect for us.

In terms of our food, my people often eat a variety of wild animals or plants that we find while hunting. Some specific examples are things such as fish, rabbit, deer, etc. 

All of our food is caught through hunting means. And my people primarily hunt while in our wolf forms"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*raises an eyebrow and mutters to self* "Ultimate Alpha..?"

*Elfriede starts to fill his plate with the various foods.*

"Ah! Eraian food isn't too much different. Although drinking is strongly discouraged, usually just 1 cup of wine at gatherings and such. Although I myself have never drank anything."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

Atalantia overhears Elfriede mutter to himself, and points her attention towards him. 

"Is there something on your mind, that you care to discuss. I believe it is important to present any concerns or judgements if we are to travel together."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*Elfriede is slightly thrown off and his face goes flush* "I-I was just wondering uhhh... Being in wolf form is like.."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

In a proud manner Atalantia happily explains what it's like to transform into a wolf form.

"Transforming into a wolf form is one of the greatest gifts that the spirits have given our people. Being a wolf is really no different than being in a humanoid form. We breathe, think, and act similarly to the way humans do. The only main differences is that we have heightened senses of hearing, smell, sight, and can travel much faster. It is for these reasons that my tribe prefers our wolf form for matters such as hunting, scouting, and travel."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

*Kailyn paces into the room, flustered.*

"Sorry I'm late to dinner, was too caught up with my book," said Kailyn, blushing.

"You know how us cats like to nap."

"What did I miss?"

*Kailyn takes a seat by the dinner table.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

Afina clasped her hands. "Amazing! That's astounding! How interesting it must be to experience life that way!" Afina shot a glance at K, wondering if the lateness to dinner was deliberate or not. She gave her the benefit of the doubt, making a mental note that laguz really DID adopt aspects of their animals selves. "We were just talking about our cultures and their contrasts"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

"That's quite interesting! I was raised in a noble Callorian household, and I've always found the Callorian culture to be interesting, but perhaps Atalantia could enlighten us more on her kingdom?"

"Did someone see something?"

Kailyn blinked for a moment. "Perhaps my imagination."

Kailyn then began to dine while paying attention to the other visitors and host.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

"Yes Atalanta! What is the role of family in your kingdom? For any ally with Callora, I don't find myself particularly most acquainted with Wynne. Our relations being so good already and all. When do you start schooling? Are professors present there too?" Afina asked, clearly assuming FAR too many similarities between Laera and Wynne.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

"Seriously, am I the only one who sees this?" Kailyn blinks again.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

"Ah, yes, welcome K." 
"What are you mumbling about?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

"I don't know, perhaps just the wind." Kailyn began cut gently into her food, looking towards Afina.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

*Afina is too absorbed about the prospect of learning about Wynne to even acknowledge the odd illusions that seem to keep popping up*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

"To answer your questions Afina," Kailyn said taking another bite.

"I was a simple woman of a household that was absorbed by a later household due to financial reasons. My youth was quite a touching time in my life that I remember passionately."

"I did have a tutor with me, Mr. Borilak. Very strict man, but taught me much of the world and gave me my interests in knowledge."

Kailyn took a sip of her drink to relax as she digested more of the morsels on the table.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

Atalantia becomes amused that most of the guests seem interested in her heritage; this type of a situation has never occurred before. 

"I am afraid you all have the misconception that my people are heavily guided by the Wynnite culture. I personally am part of a tribe, where my people have taught each other the ways of life, specifically in terms of survival. I have been fortunate enough to have learned how to read, write, and behave in a respectable manner from my parents, who were initially the Alphas of my pack. As alphas my parents had frequent connection with some Wynne people, but only for means of trading, territorial discussions, and when the Wynne and my tribe conflicted. 

The values of family and loyalty are highly observed by my people. My people all help one another perform our daily tasks, and we treat each other with great respect. However if one breaks our trust or betrays us, we do not take it very lightly"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

"Ah K I'm so sorry I have heard that. Parents are a valuable component for passing on knowledge to their children. But I'm glad to see you've still become such an astute young lady!"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

Kailyn smiles, "Thank you Afina, I do miss my parents and love them deeply. Being an only child garnered me so much of their attention that it feels odd to be without them."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

"And Atalantia, does that mean you currently reside with your family?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*Elfriede nods* 
(Although he dislikes the idea of a tribal civilization he recognizes the strength of the woman before him and can deny the simple fact that she could crush him if they had no weapons.)

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

"I do not reside with my family currently. My parents lost their alpha status and were essentially banished from our tribe. Several years later my brother and I took over; hence my ultimate alpha status. And currently I have left my tribe because my new goal is to become the ruler of Wynne, which is where you come in to play Afina... The symbol of alliance with you is crucial towards my success in becoming ruler..."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

*Kailyn gives a glance at Atalantia.*

"Is it so important for you to become ruler?" she asked. She knows the answer, but figured to ask anyway.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

"I..... have parents, although they are sort of distant at times. They are both very busy people, I have a closer bond with my sister for sure. She is an impressive fighter indeed."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

Atalantia glares at K, "Yes, becoming ruler is very important."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

*Kailyn takes another drink, hoping for a more interesting response to entertain her.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

Afina quickly catches on to the contention that is arising from the table. She nods. "Agreed, it is. If no one aspires to be ruler then we'll live in a world full of weak authority thrust into the ruling position"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

"Or perhaps the world will go on," Kailyn interjects, staring at her face reflected in her beverage.

She sighs and looks up with a perked face.
"I'm sorry," she says, "it isn't my place to impose."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*Elfriede sighs* (These two are nothing but trouble..)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

"Clearly," Afina thinks to herself. Externally, she smiles. "No worries, admitting your own ignorances is one of the first things we learn in Laera."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-19*

"Perhaps it is time for me to rest. If you excuse me," Kailyn rose from her chair, pushing it back in, and heading to one of the rooms Itory prepared for them. Before taking her last step out of the light, she paused and looked back at the others.

"Afina," Kailyn says, "You said if no one aspires to be ruler then the weak will be thrust into position. I disagree, instead the wicked will take the thrones of gold."
"That being said, can anyone be-," Kailyn paused, "No, nevermind. Goodnight everyone. I will see you tomorrow."

*[Kailyn exits]*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

Afina turns to her other guests. "Clearly there are some cultural differences between us."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

"cultural differences are to be expected, but let us work together to get through our differences"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-19*

"Of course!" Afina stands. "With a common goal, we all have reason to work together." She nods at both her guests. "But with that, I'm fatigued. I must bid you goodnight. I'll see you in the library in the morning." [*Afina exits*]

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-19*

Atalantia nods in acknowledgement and agreement. "I too should rest up so that I am alert for our travel. Good night everyone."

[Atalantia exits]

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-19*

*Elfriede finishes his food and stands up and stretches*

"Thank you Lady for the fine meal, I'm afraid I must rest up for the journey tomorrow."

"Goodnight you two" *he nods towards the two exiting women*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

[END ASIDE]

They hadn't been at the road for long, maybe an hour at most. Conversation for the most part had been kept to a minimum, the tension of last night's conversation still lingering in the air a bit. Afina glanced around at the terrain, which had become quite a boring sight by then. A flash of light caught her eyes, and she squinted at the source. Elfriede's sword has reflected the sunlight into her eyes. Speeding up to be in step with her traveling companion. "Where did you get the sword?" She asked, leaning forward and pointing.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

" Ah, usually were given weaponry by the Eraian military! But my family actually had this commissioned recently when they found out about my promotion to knight-leiutenant." *Elfriede smiles at Afinas sudden interest* 
"That reminds me, I was curious about kinds of magic you know in case a combat situation arises on our path... Not that I expect any resistance, this is Eraia after all."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

"Interesting!" She remarked. "You did mention you were a noble after all, I should have figured as much. And oh! Me?" Afina points to herself, surprised that someone would ask about her own abilities. Though. After that little stunt in the library, she should be slightly less shocked that her companions would be inquisitive about such a feat. "I was raised with an instructor proficient in light magic. He taught me to use it and I've been practicing since I was younger. I'm likely the most skilled light magic user in my kingdom, after my instructor of course." She shifted the straps on her pack, the weight of the magic books inside shifting with it. "Are you familiar with light magic users? Being from Eraia I would only assume as much."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

"Aye there are a decent amount in the military although we don't really mingle except for in combat. There are definitely more female light magic users than male. It's kind of encouraged. My sister is a definite exception.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

"What is your sister like?" Afina asked. An only child herself, she never knew much about what it was like to have siblings. She had friends, sure, but most of the time they were ordered to play with her. Because naturally, a princess' friends were thoroughly screened beforehand.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

"She is .. well overall distant although supportive.. she always challenging me to be my best. I want to be able to best her in a duel someday, she's amazing."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

"Does she also use a sword? Is she a part of the military? How interesting it must be to have a military family. You know, Laera emphasizes near the exact opposite policy. The have plans for a military should it be needed, but you would never see a knight-lieutenant doing an escort mission. Just training and training and training." Afina promptly cut herself off as she realized she had started rambling. Eraia was such unfamiliar territory she couldn't help but have a million questions.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

"yeah she is certainly military. Much higher ranking than me. To be honest it's a bit strange that I was sent to deliver the letter, until it was revealed that I'd be escorting a person of interest. Namely yourself Lady Afina." *Elfriede smiles and nods*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

"Of course. They assume that I'm only a scholar, not capable of defending myself. Though I appreciate the company and extra  defense! What compelled you to join the military? Your family? Defense of region and homeland?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

"Family tradition at this point. When my family arrived in Eraia a few hundred years ago, the second generation took up arms. I dicided to use a rapier like my sister. Although she uses a buckler while I decided on a smaller dagger in my off hand."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Afina turns her head to the side in confusion. "So you've never considered anything else?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

*Elfriede chuckles as if it should answer itself* "No.. definitely not, I've always aspires to make my parents proud. Which... I feel like I've done. Except....*Elfriede shifts uncomfortablly* they non stop hound me about finding a wife....Anytime I'm seen by them in the company of any female they immdietly think we're engaged."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Afina blinked a few times, mulling over the sentiment of making parents proud. Was this something all nobles were cursed with feeling? She laughed lightly at the second comment, nodding her head in agreement. "Of course! But that's parents for you. Especially noble parents. They've always wanted the same for me since I was young. I can relate!" She laughs. "It's hard being a noble sometimes, isn't it?"

She fidgets a bit, glancing at the ground. "How exactly did you know you made your parents proud, if I may ask?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

"Heh... *Elfriede glances down* I guess I'm more assuming I did because im doing what they wanted. I have top grades and marks on my military prowess. Why shouldnt they be proud right? *Elfriede sighs* My sister told me that shes proud of my progress at the very least." *He slightly forces a smile*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-21*

Afina pats his shoulder comfortingly. "I know what's like. It's hard. But know that many nobles before you have gone through the same expectations and challenges and come through okay. Logically speaking, everything will be okay in the end." She clears her throat, noting that the ears of the other two in her company were (literally) perked. "Anyways. we're bound to be at Eraia in a few hours time! Is there anything worth noting before we arrive?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-21*

"Overall, foreigners are welcome, definetly watch your tongue about Lyllalel. *softer* ... Not that I think you'll be the problem there" *glances around*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

"Pfft, we'll be fine, what's the worst that could happen?"

[END ASIDE]

``` Location: Eraian Checkpoint
Characters: Afina, Atalantia, Elfriede, and Kailyn
Coming from: Eraian Check In Counter```  Afina sighs. "Listen, as inheritor to eons of Tyndall knowledge, I _know_ I'm most qualified to make the decision as to what our company partakes in. And furthermore, as princess of noble blood, I know I also have the authority to do so. But before I make my verdict, I have a grievance to air. And it is this: the disjointed nature of our party is making it much more difficult for us to accomplish the tasks we seek to accomplish. Why is this?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn raises her head.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

*Elfriede's eyes narrow*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"I am sorry, but I disagree that you are the most qualified. As a party, shouldn't we all be equally qualified? Especially if we all are to escort you to Eraia.

Obviously our party's disjointed nature is from a difference in views. And certainly right now, we all have a different opinion on how to handle the bandit situation"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*She feels uneasy from Afina's words. Her inflection, her belief of being most correct. This pompous attitude that she felt before. Perhaps its just ignorance or innocents, but this perkiness has expanded to something more.*

*Kailyn clicks her teeth. What an unusual party she has put herself in.*

*She doesn't know if she enjoys it or dislikes it. Perhaps time will tell.*

"Elfriede, what is your goal?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

"Laerans believe that knowledge is inherited like eye color and face. It's only natural that my ancestors have garnered intelligence over the years to enhance my own abilities as a tactician. Do you disagree? Even if so, it's evident the commander is most receptive to myself and Elfriede, and therefore we are tactically the best to present our goals to him. It only makes sense."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn looks at Afina, only to sigh.*

"Afina," she says worryingly, "You are wrong. Or if you are right you have yet to show me."

"Intelligence, experience, these come from work and discipline. To study the arts and ways of flow."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"I agree that you are qualified to help make decisions, however I disagree that you are the most qualified to make the decisions.

Perhaps I failed to state this before, but I was the Ultimate Alpha of my tribe. Which means I was the commanding leader, and the strongest of my pack. However even as I commanded I strongly valued all my peoples' opinions and would use them to help me make my decisions." Atalantia states towards Afina.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"Afina, if are the wisest and the most intelligence, then why do we bicker here now? Why did you not decide based on your virtues? Why can my words, which should be insignificant to you and Elfriede, still pierce like spears?"

*Kailyn stands strong.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

*Elfriede sighs*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

Afina folds her arms. "In Laera we also don't discriminate against the laguz, but I'm wise enough to know when favorable situations are presented. I would happily have a laguz read our verdict, but know it would not be wise in Eraian territory, where individuals are not so friendly. Furthermore, as rightful inheritor to the Tyndall throne, it's only fitting I hold Council of everyone's opinions, and deliver the final decision myself." Afina, caught off guard, turns wide-eyed to K. "Like spears! Hardly! You make good Council but nothing a proper leader can't handle. If I were to be unfit, I would've made a decision without counsel first, thank you!" She unfolds and re-folds her arms with a huff.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn smiles.*

"And yet Elfriede sighs and you shout with passion."

"I see the snickers and glares, the movements of you two. If the strong truly rule, then let their words stand firm on their own. I stand on my own words above, without a throne."

"If you wish to prove me wrong, then let us go."

*She looks at the guard once more*

"I believe we'd all like to know where those bandits are."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

*Elfriede's eyes narrow again*
"You should all try to keep your emotions in check. I said we'd come back didnt I? You dont just get to be a soldier and do whatever you want. Military is a stucture. You abide by the rules while still trying to do some good."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"And yet you lie to my face again."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"Oh princess.... in times of need, wouldn't you help your people? It is important for a ruler to make sure that crimes are resolved and stopped. While the bandits aren't necessarily affecting those of your kind, they are impacting both my people and those in Eraia. Perhaps by resolving this issue now Eraia would be more willing to assist you with your teachings?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"Do you narrow your eyes and speak to me as a soldier or as an opponent of my request?" Kailyin looks back and Elfriede, only giving a smirk.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"Ha! Well sorry to say Elfriede, the world does not necessary revolve around military structure. 

We are a party. Each of us have our own experiences and culture. So to abide by a certain structure that we all do not agree upon will surely lead to trouble" Atalantia says smirking.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"I like that," Kailyn says looking at Atalantia.
"We are a party, despite the disagreements and upsets."

"That being said," Kailyn focuses back on Elfriede, "You should know such an issue would never be handed back to you once you leave to Trisp. I doubt we will come back, as I'm sure you do too."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"I agree with K. Plus if we leave, the problem would only persist, and maybe it would fester into a larger scale issue"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"Kill the sickness before it spreads."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

"You critique me for not seeing the perspective from your own place and now you do the same to others. Clearly Elfriede has reason to think the way he does. I doubt either of you are familiar with Eraian military structure. He could get punished should something happen to me. And you act like his needs don't matter."

"And this need not be a human nobility versus laguz issue, do not get any ideas."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn stares down Afina, only to relax. She wouldn't know.*

"You know so little about me Afina," Kailyn says.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

"And you about me." She says, eyeing K warily.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn faces Afina.*

"If we are to continue, we must build trust," Kailyn says, hand resting on Afina's shoulder.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"I never said I understood the Eraian military structure.

And do you honestly feel that I am not capable of keeping my word and protecting you too? Isn't this adventure to help you gain more practical experience, so that you may learn light magic?

Plus as a military man of Eraia, shouldn't it be of Elfriede's best interest to stop the crimes against the Eraian people?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

Afina tries to hide the slight twinge from physical contact. It had been a long time since someone had made the first move towards her; everyone around her had before only _reacted_, never asserted. "I see your point, and I understand your perspective, yes. And in turn, I would appreciate my own authority to be recognized as such."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"It is you arent listening. If we were allowed free will to do whatever we wanted whenever we wouldnt be a military, we be an unorganized militia."

"Also both of you are currently pupils to Afina, especially you K. I fingured you treat her as a teacher." *he says scowling*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn ignores Elfriede, annoyed with the lack of reasoning. It's fine, she will simply go for the boss.*

"Do you disagree that we should stop this violence?" Kailyn softly speaks to Afina.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"How are we pupils?" Atalantia laughs, while asking Elfriede

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"My orders as of this moment are to ensure Afina's safety. And theres no telling how far out of the way this is."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn wants to snap at Elfriede. Now he tells the truth, now he speaks without lies. But no, relax. Things will get done.*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"As stated before, aren't we a party? So aren't we all on equal ground?

And why would ensuring Afina's safety, while helping to ensure the safety of the Eraian people, be a problem dear Elfriede?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-10-26*

"No, the violence should stop. I'm sick of it, and I'm sick of all the pushback." Afina glances at the door, leading back to the guards and patrol outside. "I need to think. And I have all the information I need. I'll deliver my answer soon." Afina turns quickly, and rushes out the door.

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn glares down Elfriede.*
"You now speak the truth?" *She scoffs him.* "And I thought I was a class act."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"The conversation is a bit unfinished I believe, Afina.

How are we to form a trusting and cooperative party if we all give up on debating so quickly"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

(You might want to chase her Atalantia since she left)

*Kailyn leaves the same way.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"I've been speaking the truth, you are just too wound up in your opinions to listen."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

*Atalantia walks towards the enterance after Afina, blocking the door* 

"We have unfinished business right now"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

(likewise Elfriede if you want)

(Fuck it)

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"It is because we all have our own opinions that this is an important matter to discuss. I wish for our entire party to get along. For all of us to understand each others ways. And perhaps for us to learn from one another" Atalantia says modestly

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn storms back in*

"How have I been wound up? Did you not say Trisp was just along the border? A lie if I ever heard one."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"I said it wasnt far, we've walked this far into Eraia, over half the journey is done."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"But do you think that once there your duty will end? Sure not Afina's. If we are to act, we are to act now."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"We ALL are to help in protecting Afina, not just you." Atalantia states toward Elfriede

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn trys to keep a level head. She remembers Elfriede's stares and nudges. We are both annoyed, but the one who can argue them out shall win.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"For your information child, this mission is extra anyways, I'm on a short leave and can do with my time what I want for the remaing few weeks, I could come back if I wanted to but I have faith that the military has it under control."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"Then let us help with this issue now." *Kailyn presses her hand on her chest.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"If someone were to be robbing a caravan right in front of us I would no doubt skewer them."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"So you want a vacation with your free time? HA

Wouldn't a brilliant military man like yourself want to use that time effectively to help your people? I don't understand how one can ignore those in need, especially if they are of your kin?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"I will. Elsewhere."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"you will what?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn sighs*
"Perhaps you just don't understand the point."

"There is no reasoning here."

"Only excuses."

*Kailyn leaves through door once more, tired of this back and forth.*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-10-26*

"I'm not arguing with you two, you have no bareing over me."
*Elfriede scowls again and decides to walk over to the commander to chat while keeping an eye on Afina out the window*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Still the goal is in her mind. She will stop these bandits.*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

*Atalantia is still blocking the door* 

"Why do all of you wish to leave in the middle of a debate?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn looks up to see Atalantia.*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"If none of you wish to resolve this bandit issue, I will have no problem taking matters into my own hands."

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn grabs Atalantia.*

"Wait, and I'll help. However, patience is still a virtue, especially at times like these."

"4 is greater than 2."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

*Atalantia has a determined look in her eyes yet again. She is clearly infuriated that people wish to let the bandit problem go unsolved*

"How can I have patience if no one wishes to talk this out?"

"How can I be accepting of people who would allow criminals to go unpunished?"

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

"We will see once Afina returns."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

"I suppose..." *Atalantia is clearly frustrated. She is not used to people looking down on her, let alone disregarding her abilities*

**John Bucknam** - *2017-10-26*

*Kailyn whispers into Atalantia's ear.*

"Elfriede steers towards Afina and Afina steers her own path, all we have to do is make sure that her path is the path we want."

*Kailyn passes Atalantina, scooting her to open the door.*
"The seed has already been sewn my friend. Now we just have to wait for the plant to grow."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-10-26*

*Atalantia's eyes widen upon hearing K. K was not wrong, but Atalantia wondered how she could convince Afina that the matter is crucial to solve*

He’s taken aback by the harsh tone in her voice, after a second he responds “Hey look, Not only did I defend you back there but I also helped create a distraction for you to run away and hide, then run some more. So I think I deserve some answers. Plus I think we could help each other.” he tries to land on a lighter note than he started with.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-02*

Nokri huffed. "Yeah, thanks," she replied as sarcastically as ever. It was great that he did that, she's probably alive now thanks to this laguz, but she didn't recall ever asking for his help. 
Though on the other hand, if he wasn't against her, keeping this guy around might be useful. He could probably fight, and possibly notice any soldiers before she could with whatever dog powers he had.  As he said, maybe they could help each other.  "Alright, I'm listening." Though still sharp, her tone was a bit softer. "What do you want me to help you with?" She tried recalling what he said before all hell broke loose. Something about an illness or defect or such.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-02*

"Well I recall you started to mention something that might be able to help me with my transformation problem? Before... what ever that was back there  happened."  "And even though I cant use wolf form like most laguz, I'm pretty skilled with my bow" he says pointing with his thumb tot the weapon on his back "So if our paths seem to gravitate in the same direction I could defend us and I could keep anymore Drecians off your back."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-02*

"Mmm. Right. Transformation." She eyed the bow and quiver of arrows while trying to remember something she read ages ago. She hadn't been paying much attention to those books when she read them. "I did pick up a tidbit in the past. About a similar situation, something about not being able to transform and a method of fixing it. I'd have to find a certain book again to be sure." Nokri wondered if she would be able to recognize the book. She could point out everything that was in her parent's collection, but she'd have to peruse the inside of the actual book to remember its contents again. "If me or you can find that book I could give it a shot. I'll help your problem if you keep me alive. Whaddya think? Deal?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-03*

"sounds good, but where would we be able to find a book like that? Do you know anyone with a large library or collection of books? I wouldn't even know where to start"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-03*

Despite having been there for a year, Nokri wasn't too familiar with the bustling city aside from the marketplace and merchant districts. After a moment's hesitation she suggested "this town's gotta have a library, right? Better place than any to start."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-03*

"Do you think it wise to stay in the city with all the that's just happened? You'd know better than I what ends the Drecians will go to get to you but word travels fast in a place like this, it may be dangerous to go asking around." He runs a hand through his hair and bites his lip thinking hard "Eraia isn't far from here, and the Drecians wouldn't bother you there" he  says with a shrug

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-03*

"Ah." Nokri stared at him blankly. That was true, and something she hadn't considered. She preferred to act in the moment and face whatever may come as a consequence later, but in this instance it may cost her her life. She tapped her head against the stone wall and sighed. "Ok. Wherever you think will have it, that's where we'll go. Eraia? Sure, that works. I need to stop somewhere first though, no discussion about it." Nokri had no doubt that if she left, people would notice and ransack her house. She didn't have many valuables but the ones that were in her possession were definitely things worth protecting.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-11-03*

"Its worth a shot" he replies "Let's just try to make it quick, the further behind us this city is, the better"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-11-03*

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-27*

```Location: Forest Trail, Border of Eraia
Asided Near: Bandit hut
Characters: Afina, Elfriede```
*Elfriede gasps softly in the brush as he watches the two Laguz put into a semi desperate situation as the door closed.* 

*He tenses up and glances over to Afina and nods.*

*Elfriede slips his rapier and dagger out of their sheathes and begins steathly aproaching the door.*

*He puts his ear near the wall to hear subtle yet tense conversing along with some scuffling sounds.*
*Faun motions to Afina to approach.*

Elfriede very softly questions her, "Do we wait until our companions make their move? I am concerned that they may be unnecessarily wounded, yet I do not want my charge to be injured for our way back."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-27*

Afina gaped in astonishment as she watched her companions disappear behind the closed door. She composed herself quickly, noticing Elfriede drawing his weapons. Tomes were usually a two-handed job, so she left her dagger sheathed, and her hand twitched trying to decide which spell to prepare. She couldn't bring herself to choose.

Following Elfriede to the door, she crouches near him. "I don't want to say I told them so, but I told them so. Though you'd think even laguz bandits would respect proper diplomacy, so I believe we do have some time. They won't injure our party without garnering information first. So I believe we should attack. What is our strategy? I can spell cast from a window, or attack from directly behind you. What do you think is best?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-27*

*Elfriede grits his teeth*

"To be honest I want to see these fool hearty bandits punished swiftly, but I dont want to go about this by just charging in.... hmmm... yet, that may be our best option."

"You could indeed cast from the window as I enter, now the question remains... should we wait for our ally's to make a move. or just move in to prevent injury to them. They might get injured all the same."

*Elfriede visibly tenses and looks stressed*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-27*

She nods. "I too wish for justice to be done." _Especially because I was right to assume this WAS the bandit hideout..._ she adds mentally. Afina bites her lip, mulling over their strategic options. To wait or to attack...

She suddenly notes Elfriede's tense posture, and overall stressed nature. She puts a hand on his shoulder. "Don't worry, no matter what, our company has the skills to eliminate and bring justice to this threat. Everything will be righted once more." She smiles confidently, though perhaps also saying these words to assure not only Elfriede, but herself.

She takes a deep breath. "Therefore, I believe we should attack first, as a preemptive attack always has the advantage. I shall use my light magic to stun our enemies and, sadly, as well as our friends. Because their senses are impaired, you can then attack, and I shall provide support with defensive and offensive spells.   Yes?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-11-27*

*Elfriede ponders the decision and breifly nods.* 

"K might even recognize the spell and shut her eyes. We can only hope. Perhaps its time to make these bandits understand who it is they are trying to rob."

*Elfriedes posture releases all his stress as he readies himself for battle.*

*He readies himself standing at the door one hand gently on the handle*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-11-27*

"Of course! We'll make short work of these DUMB bandits." She grinned, excited to once again be able to use Laeran curse words in a proper situation. With one last wish of good luck to Elfriede, she crawled to the nearest window, crouched beneath the sill. She flipped through the book, at last settling on a brightness spell. This would provide the perfect distraction. She took a tight, nervous breath, reminding herself that she was a confident Tyndall, a wise Laeran, a strong noble. And, after all, a princess has a duty to protect her people. Be it Laerans, or a simple traveling company.

“The way seems safe now but you look like maybe you have something you’d like to ask or say to him?” He says, followed by a in a lower voice “and maybe a little bit like you want to slap me right about now”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-01*

After ascertaining the sage's back was turned and his attention was elsewhere, Nokri grabbed a napkin. "Are you insane? Didn't you hear who he was? Look at your face!!" She showed no hesitation in mercilessly wiping off his chin, like a mad mother cleaning up her messy kid before a fancy event. "He's probably too busy for the likes of us now, he must be a very busy man," her angry whisper changed to a more thoughtful tone. "Can we gain anything more by staying?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

He blushes at her touch as his face falls. "s-s-sorry" he stutters "I'm not all that familiar with titles and such, Ive only arrived here this mroning. In my defence I was still a little stunned by your story , or truth -whichever it may be."  he swallows his resolve and continues "You seemed suddenly interested and so I thought maybe you were trying to hint at something by asking me if the way was truely clear"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-01*

*At least he's sorry. Yeesh, he'll know now how to treat people for the future,* she thought. She smirked about her backstory, not bothering to say if it was the truth or not. She was still a little wary of this guy she met that morning and if he stuck around long enough he'd find out anyway.

"Listen. Anyone who goes around calling themself grand or great or almighty or whatever is either insanely rich and powerful or just plain insane. Maybe we can luck out and come across the former." She didn't say a reason for wanting to come across such a person, there wasn't one really other than a delusion some knight in shining armor would scoop them up and plop them into a cozy laid-back life. Nokri folded up the dirty napkin so the dirty part was hidden inside and placed it back on the table. "Did anything fall on the floor? We have all our bags right? If we're ever in the city again I'd like to stop back."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

He clears his throat "Fair enough although we could ask the man for a place to stay if you'd like? He seems to think highly of us even with my botched manners" empaphazing the last 2 words in a false fancy accent. "Ha - anyway I'll leave it up to you, Im good too keep going but its going to be a long journey, not so sure how familiar you are with walking for days on end"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-01*

Her jaw dropped. If they could stay in the observatory for days that would be fan-tastic. She could only imagine how plush the beds were. "No, no we can't do that. Ugh. We can't. That would be imposing. Plus, didn't you want to find that cure?" She forced herself towards the door, away from the posh chairs where the acclaimed sage had sat. "I can walk, don't you worry about me. Let's... let's just go." It would be awkward to stand around for *too* long. "But next time you should totally use that accent, it suits you," she said with a straight face.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-01*

Aldus smiles at the compliment whether or not it was made in earnest doent really matter to him, he lets out a short chuckle "Suit yourself - lets be on our way then"  he says moving toward the door.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

```Location: Eraia Border, Woods
Asided from: After Cabin fight
Characters: Elfriede, Afina, Atalantia, (Kailyn)```

“Ah, Lady Afina…” *Elfriede sighs* “You are okay, I wasn't sure when I heard the commotion outsid---” *Elfriede Sways from waves of nausea and pain*
*He steadies himself and his eyes refocus on the recently deceased corpse at his feet and he glances back up to Afina, then to Atalantia embarrassed* 
“I….dont usually if it's not necessary… but sometimes….” *His voice trails*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

Afina nods. "A nobles discretion can be trusted. It cannot be helped. No matter how... distasteful." She points to his clothes. "More prominently, however, your injuries? Where are you bleeding?" She holds out a hand to Elfriede's back, hoping to help steady him.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

Atalantia remained by Elfriede's side once the combat concluded. She was determined to ensure that his wounds were still attended to, despite his objection to such care. Atalantia chose not to speak immediately, and continued to observe the reunion her her peers.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

*Elfriede smirks slightly and glances to the two people supporting him* "...Thanks for being so understanding." *Elfriede glances around the room at all the prone figures and sees that several of them are breathing but not moving* "What do you want to do with them? Take them back with us? Or should we simply send a dispatch from the Guard house at the border for clean up and arrests when we get back?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

"They're criminals." Afina says, glaring about the room. "But fair is fair. They deserve a just trail." Afina takes out a bandage and begins to wrap the wound on her arm. "Besides, they'll face harsh enough punishment for assaulting not one but _two_ nobles."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

"I agree... well send a party to arrest the remainder. Ah, and no I dont believe I have any outward wounds worth mentioning, but a bath and maybe a healer would be nice... If we head back to the guard house they could probably have it arrang-----" *Elfriede sighs lightly as his vision blurs again*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"I believe it would be best to wait until a party arrives, if we so take the action to arrest these bandits. They are NOT worthy of getting away with this lightly, and I'm afraid that they might try to flee if we don't keep watch. 

I also refuse to let them represent my people." Atalantia states with firm conviction.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

Afina smiles, putting the remainder of her bandages in her bag and withdrawing rope. "Fortunately, Itory was wise enough to pack us each with ample provisions. If we tie them up we can immediately be on our way. Besides, it seems some of us in our party require medical attention sooner rather than later," she says, warily glancing at Elfriede.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"How can we be so sure that the bandits don't have another trick up their sleeve though? They've already shown they're plenty capable of instilling more threats. 

I strongly agree that Elfriede needs medical treatment, for I did tend to his wounds originally. 
I will offer two suggestions. One, I have adequate medical knowledge to help treat and maintain his wounds and I can continue to do so until millitary arrive. Or two, you may take Elfriede back to the military sanction we originally started at, while I ensure that these criminals pose no other threats. I am a fast traveler, and will be able to meet you all back at the camp once this matter is resolved. 

I personally think it'd be in our best interest to stabilize Elfriede here, so that he doesn't end up in a worse state. He seems too weak to travel in his current state as well, and our party as a whole will not be at it's strongest. The military will be able to help treat Elfriede too, once they arrive in order to apprehend these criminals. I'm sure they won't refuse to assist nobles such as yourself" Atalantia says firmly, yet concerned for her party

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

"They need to be summoned, they didn't appear to be in any rush to get out here. They'll most likely only listen to me. We could split up for a few hours and send a squad here. But..." 
*Elfriede looks awkward and embarrassed.*
"I... may need someone strong to carry me back... if we want to make good time."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"True, you do have the authority to convince the military to help. And I'm sure they'd be reluctant to help in general. 
 I am more than capable of carrying you or supporting your weight during travel to the military base if that's what you desire. However, the decision is up to you, as well as the party as a whole. 
I still think it'd be concerning to leave these criminals alone, for they might be able to strike behind our backs."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

Afina tries to smother a smile behind her bandaged arm. It _was_ ironic that her bodyguard was the one that needed assistance now, and his bashful face was a clear indicator of as much. Afina cleared her throat, considering the options. They could leave now, summon the guards, and rendezvous with Atalantia. Or wait, buy time, and travel as a party. Afina folded her arms. "If we want to effectively reach military help, we must have Elfriede present. They wouldn't listen as aptly to another courier."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

"I agree it is concerning... hmmm I *could* make it with assistance from Afina if you prefer to remain. Would that be satisfactory Atalantia? or would you rather come along?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

"_Lady_ Afina" she nodded, correcting passively.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"No matter what, I believe that one of us should stay and watch these criminals if we decide to split the party. Truthfully, splitting up the party may be risky. 
Whether it's me who stays, or me who goes it does not particularly matter. 
I am concerned, however, about the nature of your wounds and condition. Do you and Afina truly have the strength and speed to travel fast and defend yourselves?

Alternatively, I could try my luck and travel in my wolf form to the camp. Persuade the military of our urgency and come back rapidly"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

*Elfriede straightened his spine (slightly) and tensed..*"S-sorry Lady Afina, in the situation I forgot my manners."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

"Quite alright, no worries." Afina nods. "Anyways, I doubt that would work. The military wouldn't listen to a--"

She coughs. "A civilian."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

*Atalantia shakes her head in disappointment*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

Afina frowned, narrowing her eyes in an "at least I'm trying" face. She turned to the knight lieutenant. "Elfriede? Thoughts?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

*Atalantia noticed Afina's attempt to recognize her as an equal. Progress was better than nothing* Atalantia formed a faint smile.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

*Elfriede swayed again.* "...as long as I get to the outpost today."

"We have to leave soon."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

"Agreed." Afina puts a hand on Atalantia's shoulder, pulling her own pack onto her back. She nodded awkwardly. "Stay safe, and join us once the military have collected the wrong-doers?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

*Elfriede Sheathes his sword and attempts to use it as a Psuedo Walking stick*

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

Atalantia nods, she would keep careful watch of these bandits. She respected the acknowledgement of her strength, and capabilities.  Hopefully in time, her party would learn to trust her even more

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

*Elfreide nods at her and the (still prone?) Kailyn* "Be safe."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

Afina glances outside at the rapidly approaching night time. She pulled open her book and casted a simple light spell, the glow and warm radiating through the small domicile.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"you all will wait for me, yes?" Atalantia asks to make sure, before her Allies depart.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

"Yes, I dont think I'm getting anywhere fast anyways." *He chuckles slightly*".. and I will make sure the Gaurds treat you two as my guests, with utmost respect. We wont Abandon you."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"Thank you." Atalantia nods again, truly grateful that her Allies are starting to treat her as such

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-08*

"Let us be off then," Afina says, opening the door. "Oh, and by the way, there's an unconscious laguz woman outside. You may want to drag her in here to keep an eye on. Not that I had any hand in her unconscious state."

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-08*

"you got it"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-08*

[Elfriede and Afina Leave, End Aside]

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-09*

```Location: Eraia Border traveling to military checkpoint, Woods
Asided from: After Cabin departure
Characters: Elfriede, Afina ```

"You know," Afina says, lowering the small ball of light towards Elfriede. "I don't believe you ever said what injuries you sustained. That's an awful lot of blood for you to be upright at the moment, and those laguz aren't much for merciful blows. Are you sure this was a good idea?" The two had been walking for only a few minutes, in silence, both likely lost in their own thoughts. It had been a little over a day since their party had leave Theanovene, and yet, the events of the day felt hugely life altering.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-09*

Elfriede seemed as if he was snapped out of a trance. He had been spending so much energy concentrating on walking that he was becoming lost in the traveling. He glanced over to Afina who had supported him more then once in this walk back as he lost his balance. He was indeed covered in blood, taking some care not to get any on her, but still some spots showed on her cloak.

"I have a few pulled muscles, a badly bruised......"*he searches for the words for a breif moment* "...lower back and a bit of head trauma. Nothing that some rest wont fix. This blood doesnt belong to me. It came from that unfortunate Tiger Lagu....." His voice trails off again.

"You know... my family wont be happy with me that I got this injured escorting someone." *He smirks a bit* "My sister Yuria will definetly scold me upon our arrival."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-09*

Afina smiles. "It _is_ a bit atypical, yes. Usually the escorted noble stays injury-free in their travels." She taps on the bandages wrapped around her forearm. "Not that I mind, of course. What does not kill you will make you stronger, yes?" She paused for a moment, moving the light beam farther in front of her to check for impending threats. "And your sister? What is she like?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-09*

*He stares off as if sorting his thoughts and smirks again* 
"Shes a genius. Shes an excellent fighter and probably the most supportive person I've had in my life. Yuria is older and many ranks ahead of me in the military." 
"I know that she scolds me only because she loves me and wants me to suceed for my sake. Unlike my par-.."
*Elfriede cuts off sharply and grimaces*
"Unlike some others."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-09*

Afina caught the syllable as it was cut off. Unlike his par...ents? She knew not every noble enjoyed such fantastic relations with their family. Laeran culture usually prevented such issues; it was a widespread belief that a connection to parents would increase one's intelligence. And everyone wanted to be smart in Laera. Afina furrowed her eyebrows in thought. It would be best to seem as relatable as possible now. After all, though they shared laguz companions, Afina wasn't quite sure what to make of them yet. So Elfriede seemed the most trustworthy of the bunch. "Understandable. Any thoughts as to our... traveling companions?" She nodded back towards the direction of a cabin.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-09*

"A strange lot you decided to take along with us, but they are civil enough." *Elfriede looks over to her confused as to what she meant*

"While its true that Laguz make me feel a bit uncomfortable I wont outwardly refuse the help."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-10*

Afina exhales. "Well that's a relief. For the longest time during our journey, _they_ made me feel like _I_ was in the wrong! After all, it's not _my_  fault that I was raised without laguz influenc-". Afina clears her throat, realizing she was about to start rambling. She pushes the light orb away to hide the scarlet flooding to her cheeks. "It seemed like a good idea in the moment. And clearly they mean no harm. It's just... different."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-10*

*Elfriede gets a sort of quiet*
He was somewhat in awe of Afina's... ignorance?, innocence? 
He wasn't sure the exact word he was looking for. While Lagu'z certainly made him feel uncomfortable he didnt really mind them. 
Of course this kind of talk always made Elfriede reflect inwardly. Should he be offended? 
*He shakes his head and fake smiles at Afina.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-10*

Afina fakes a smile back in response to Elfriede's genuine one. This was not going well; she felt very awkward. A noble should be good at small talk, but she had managed to avoid as much by reading instead. Reading!  "Glad you understand. So. I saw back at the tower that you too are an avid reader."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-10*

"Ah yes I read quite a bit, especially in school. I was quite the study...Graduated top of my class actually. Although, I've been having trouble finding time to read now-a-days now that I've been busy with my military orders, but I like to sneak a book in every now and then when I can. I'm sure I dont read nearly as much as you Afin-- eh..  Lady Afina..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-10*

"Probably not, but reading is my main hobby, between that and magic, of course. And do you have any other hobbies? Besides, I assume, the general military duties you already perform. I assume escorting princesses is not your _prime_ hobby."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-10*

Elfriede laughs genuinley  "No!! Indeed it is not my hobby. To be honest I don't have time for hobbies outside of training and all the missions I'm sent on. I just want to do our family name proud and perhaps one day be as skilled as Yuria."

"Whats your family like?" He asks, truly curious as how other noble families are run.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-10*

"My family? Oh! Well. In Laera I lived with my mother and father. My father was where the Tyndall side came from. He's always been very wise, but also very physically fit. Brains and braun, I guess. And my mother is a quieter woman, a bit more shrewd, always the tactician. And of course because I'm _their_ child, I'm a combination of the two. I don't have any siblings. My professor Carya was always like a grandfather to me. He came from Eraia to teach. Oh, and then there's my cousin who I grew up with and then he--." Afina's voice caught. "We don't see each other anymore. The nuclear family is big in Laera, but beyond that, not much else. It's hard to make friends as a noble as well. You know how it is."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-10*

"I... yeah... I know how it is. I've only really had my sister to be honest. Our family isnt very large and we dont have a lot of relatives in the region despite our status. That's why we have to work so hard to stay where we are." *Elfriede leans on a nearby tree to rest*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-10*

Afina nods slowly, hesitantly, and the ball of light shining the way for them flickers slightly. "It's harder being a noble then most think, of course. But I don't have to tell _you_ that." She laughs lightly, stretching her arms. "And from one noble to another... we both know what it's like. Tyndalls are exceptionally good listeners. So if you need anything..." She nods confidently.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-10*

"Thank you for your concern, its appreciated." Elfriede smiles "I think were almost back, shouldnt be much longer now. Hopefully he has somewhere for us to stay recouperate and..." *He spans his arms out show all the gross dried blood.* "A bath.... might even be more nessesary." Elfriede's face changes to both disgusted and embarrassed.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-10*

Afina holds out her cloak, looking at the dried blood. "Yes, most agreed. A bath would be terrific."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-10*

*Elfriede chuckles slightly and continues toward the checkpoint with Afina*
[End Aside]

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

```
Location: Eraian Theanovene Border Station Hallway
Asided from: Medical room
Characters: Ransford Gale, Afina Tyndall
```

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Well that's unfair, Afina frowned, eyes trailing Ransford's back as he left the room. She watched as Elfriede sighed, collapsing on a nearby bench. Clearly, he was beyond exhausted, but had no power to object to his orders. "I guess we'll have to wait for Narder..." Afina heard Elfriede say, before she abruptly jumped from her seat, and dashed into the hallway. 

The door swung partially shut behind her, ajar just enough for a beam of light to pierce the room. "Commander," she says, clearing her throat and planting her feet. "I do have a request for you."

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

Ransford comes to a slow full stop before turning around. 

"What can I do for you mi'lady?" he says, his tone flat.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina had to admit, her feet had started moving before her thoughts could fully process. She straightens up. "You see, Elfriede is entirely unfitting for combat at the moment. Though the healing magic has restored his physical health, I fear he may be too mentally disengaged to be any true help in your mission. Therefore..." she takes a second to hesitate. "I believe, as my escort, it is in my best interest that he stays here. A fatigued guard is worth nothing, especially with much of Eraia to still travel though."

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

Ransford looks at you for a moment. 

"While your interest in a soldier's well being is quite exemplary, it would be an insult to a knight to tell him he cannot finish his work because of it." 

"Or if you are merely worried for you need of an escort, I'll give you a handful of my men to get you and your allies to the capitial as soon as possible. I'd recommend you don't travel through the night, but if you insist who am I to stop you."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

"Forgive me, Commander, but Elfriede is the only escort I trust at the moment. I need him to be in pique condition to continue our travels in the morning." She cocks her head, a more serious tone edging into her voice. "You and I aren't ignorant, Commander. Callora and Eraia haven't had the best diplomacy. The royal daughter of a prominent Callorian nation visiting Eraia? Monumentous, and likely could be the first real improvement in international relations in years. It is within everyone's best interest that it goes as smoothly as possible.  And for this to occur, Elfriede must be fully recuperated to continue his mission come morning," Afina had a triumphant expression. She wasn't called a "wise youth" for nothing.

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

"*Mi'lady* I do not assume to understand why the Church does what it does in the name of Lylalel. That is not my role here." he steps close to you. You can't help but note he's quite tall.

"My role, Lady Afina of House Tyndall, is to watch this border and make sure no one who wishes to harm the women and children of Eraia crosses it. Be they Drecian, Callorian, or unaligned, I am the bastion of protection the border towns get. When you do finally enter the territory, I beesch you; ask the townsfolk how many of the bandit attacks you've heard so much about have occured there." 

"The answer is none." he says with a swipe of his hand. "That is something I can take credit for. That is what my role here is."

"My role is not to hunt down bandits in the back of the woods, who know better than to mess with an Eraian military unit. Nor is my role to clean up the mess one of my knights allowed to happen because he failed to put his foot down when his charges were divided on doing what *they were supposed to* versus getting involved in something unrelated to them." 

"So it may be true that your trip here is something special. It's certainly started off special hasn't it. But it is not in my best interest to give you what you want. It is in my, and every man, woman and child in the border towns, best interest that Sir Faun guides me and my men to this mess as fast as possible so that I can continue doing what *I"m* supposed to be doing and you can get back to what *you're* supposed to be doing."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina could feel cold feeling of adrenaline seeping into her bloodstream. "And I already _told_ you that that's a role I can fill. I know where 'this mess' is, likely better than Elfriede does. He pulled the full weight of combat, and therefore took the brunt of the hits. He likely doesn't remember where most of his injuries are, nonetheless _where_ the damn hideout even is. _I'm_ telling you that there's a solution that benefits the greatest majority, and yet you still give pushback. Why?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

"Are you not arguing this point for the sake of Faun serving as your escort? You state that you trust no other than Faun to do the job yet you volunteer to come with us." he says. 

"You are the escorted, not an escort. Putting aside the escort is not the fighter in any scenario, Faun is a soldier of Eraia and knows where his responsibilites lie. He chose to allow his charge and allies the freedom to get themselves involved in a fight that's not theirs. He should know better, and if he doesn't this is a learning experience for him. Experience breeds a soldier that survives Mi'lady Tyndall. Best he get now among friends then stranded alone among enemies."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

*In the room, sitting in the darkened corner, Elfriede's face is in his hands, flush with embarrassment. He knew Afina was trying to help, but her extreme innocence on these matters...*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

"He's as good as the escort now with how incapacitated he is!" she yells. Realizing the sudden increase in volume, she closes her eyes and takes a deep breath, lowering her voice back once more. "_He's_ tired, _I_ need a decent escort in the morning, and as it stands, I can take rectify your 'navigation' problem by leading you to the hideout myself. There's absolutely no reason to make Elfriede do it, other than the fact that _you_ want to feel a power trip. I'm confident that I'm one of the most proficient users of light magic in Callora, if not the entire realm. And yet you refuse to grant me this small request. This has no bearing on yourself anyways, why do you insist!?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-15*

As you raise your voice you can see the old soldier visibly darken, his hand twitch in the direction of his sword hilt. Just as you calm yourself he does as well, his eyes closed with a long exhale. Human nature speaks to you, telling you that it's experience you just witnessed.

"I do not speak for your skill at Lylalel's magic, however... strange... it is for a foreigner to wield her magics. Your papers brought you here as a guest of the realm, not a fighter. You are to be treated as such, as summarily stated in that paperwork. Escorting a regiment of men to a bandit encampment is a knight's job, not that of a guest." he says. "As for why I refuse this request?" he adds, looking at the ceiling.

His face swings back down to the princess. "You are not a princess here, you are a guest. You do not command me, or anyone else in Eraia. I act in the interest of my country, my men, my god and my people. Not that of a foreign princess."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

At that Elfriede's eyes shoot open and he winced. He didn't like Ransford all that much either, but he feared she may have crossed a line. Elfriede shot up, threw open the door and took two quick paces over behind Afina. 
"I am sorry princess, but Narder said its time to clean us up!" 
He says hurried, as he locks both his elbows under Afina's arms and starts bringing her back to the room. He wanted to be annoyed at her for her harsh words. He wanted to tell her she was embarrassing his honor as a knight. In truth he was flattered and wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all. 
He eyed Ransford the whole way back to the room. He wanted him to understand that Elfriede got his point. However... Faun wouldn't be upset if he never had to see the big man again.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

"Unhand me! I wasn't finished speaking! He undermined my authorit-" Afina started, struggling against his grasp, before the door to the room slammed shut behind them. Afina pushes out of Elfriede's hold. "What was that for! I almost had him!"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

Elfriede eyed Afina harshly trying to keep his stern gaze, but in truth he wanted to burst out laughing. He slipped and a small smirk peaked through. 
"Whether we like it or not we are at Ransford's mercy here. Nothing we have would protect us from an entire garrison off Eraian military."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina folded her arms. "He almost saw my reasoning. He would have understood if I had just pressed him a little further. The situation would have ended in everyone's favor anyways. I do not see your point in stepping in," she eyed Elfriede, her glaring gaze softening when she realized that Elfriede _had_ in fact stepped in. "Did you... hear all that?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

Elfriede shrugs slightly. "... a bit... I mean... *technically* Ransford is right... I shouldn't be shirking my duties... despite my current state." *Elfriedes tone sounds more down and he lets out a defeated sigh*
"Yuria would be disapointed in me for sure for underestimating our enemies back there."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

"But that's not your fault!" Afina motions to the door. "I said before, you took the majority of the..." she searched for a word. "of the team's hits. And dealt the most damage. It's only natural that you would be the most injured. _BRAWNnsford_ back there has no idea what he is talking about. Nothing is your fault." She hesitates, shaking her head. "I don't think your sister would be ashamed either. You  were loyal to your mission and your-- charges. The best soldier isn't characterized by the strength of his body, but the strength of his resolve. I mean, look at you!" Afina points to his garments. "You're clearly determined if the blood you're covered in isn't even your own."

She almost laughs, but reminds herself why she was yelling earlier. "Either way, this is clearly unfair treatment. Especially for a noble."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

Elfriede grimaces.
"Afina... being a noble doesnt matter in the Eraian Military... It really hasnt matter much my whole life. It just meant I had to try harder. *Be* better then everyone else. My parents, although providing for all of my worldly needs... (again he drops this topic) I need to do the Faun name justice if we want to keep our place in the world. Eraian nobility is very competitive."
Elfriede stands up straight and looks Afina straight on.

"And that means escorting a certain person of interest *properly*."
*Elfriede smiles in a warm and disarming way*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina bristles at the mention of her name, noticing that Elfriede had dropped the "lady" title. She almost corrects him, but decides against it. He had had a long enough day as it was. She relaxes her shoulders and stares down at the floor. Last time she had yielded to someone else's ideas, she had embarrassed herself entirely. At least then, she could've justified her decision as the "right" thing to do. Now, she knew it wasn't right for Elfriede to be sent to lead the troops back to the hideout. She almost wants to argue again, but realizes that its not worth the fight. _Nothing_ was worth the fight today. She had picked too many, and wasn't it her haughty nature that got her sent away from home to begin with? The events of the day had taught her that it was time to make some friends for once, not just allies and escorts and charges and all the other terms that she had used to neatly categorize the functions that everyone served for her. Elfriede smiles, and she can't help but return the gesture. Yes, maybe make some friends, she thinks to herself. "Does that mean I most definitely embarrassed you in front of your superior then?" she asks sheepishly.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

Elfriede looks at her and thinks for a moment, "Yes, but no need for apologies or anything. You were just being honest. Besides.... you've paid me back enough with your flattery. You could have had any escort but you were insistent on me. I must have done *something* right. Or perhaps you are always that caring?" (clearly showing that he heard the conversation in full).

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina straightens up. "I'll have you know, you have a strong proficiency in combat, and the flaw was moreso in your approach. I respect your skills, and the plan was contrived flawlessly. But-" Afina scolds herself mentally. Nicer, Afina! Stubbornness has gotten you nowhere today! "But I'm sure that time will shape you into a perfect soldier on all fronts. And naturally I care about my company! After all, another noble is very difficult to come by, and even moreso is one that actually has an affinity for reading." Her slight smile drops. "So what IS our plan for tonight?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

Elfriede shrugs. "I guess we're going back to the hut... Lets get it done with so we can be gone from here and stay somewhere decent, as you have suggested."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina sighs. "Tyndalls are peaceful people, but I would almost kill to stay at a proper inn. When you suggested resting in the barracks here, I was undoubtedly shocked," she laughed lightly. "I agree, however. If Ransford isn't to yield, then it's best we help take care of the situation and continue on our way."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

"I... apologize Lady Afina, I wasn't thinking clearly..." *Elfriede looks down uncomfortably.*
"I have no desire to stay here tonight. Lets retrieve our companions and be gone." Elfriede looking down at his clothes once again grimaces in disgust.
"I cant wait to bathe... I probably smell as terrible as I look."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina laughs, arranging her pack to once more be carried, and examining her tomes for damage. "It's alright, we all probably smell like  animals at this point," she says, flipping through the book. She stands up straight, hoisting her bag onto her shoulders. "Shall we go?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-15*

Elfriede glances over to Narder. "As soon as he cleans us up a bit. I know not exactly *how* he plans on doing such but..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-15*

Afina shrugs off her pack, setting it down on the bench beside her. "Of course. Sir Narder, if you would please?"

A musician *gruntage intensifies* who annoyed the local gang leader." Sighing, he looks at Aldus exasperated , "seriously do you want a pair of murderous thugs to break down your door?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

Every movement the dresser made along the ground made Nokri flinch, knowing that every scratch along the hardwood floor was another cent of their deposit they weren't getting back. "Ok. So you're being chased by this gang? What's that got to do with us?" The banging on the door was starting to grate on her nerves.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-17*

"Of course I dont , I also didnt want to get body slammed into the ground by some person Ive never even heard of before, just as I was about to get the only decent sleep I've had in a week!"  Aldus takes a deep breath and steadies himself and contiues "But I suppose that will have to wait now"  He begudingly helps Eliran lift the dresser and place in front of the door

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-17*

"Thank you, and look its not like I wanted to ruin your night ok? I'm sorry but it was your room or Meatslab and Brickface outside" Eliran said gesturing back to the door. Looking around the room, Eliran spotted a window, and had an idea. "Could you help me a little bit more?" He started quickly, this needed to happen fast, "The owner here owes me a favor, so I can get you this room free for the night if you can help me out trick these two real quick."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-17*

All four of Aldus' ear perk up at the word 'free'

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

"Yeah, sure." Seeing his gaze towards the window, Nokri walked over and opened it as wide as she could, then gestured towards it to the street below as though she was helping. "Here you go, one escape route." In her mind she added *don't forget to throw in a word for us with the hotel owner you're so chummy with.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-17*

"While the idea of a free room is definetly appeling, wont these men be just as enraged with us for helping you? Im not in the mood for a beating tonight - or any ngiht" he notes quiter this time

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-17*

Eliran shook his head, "Not exactly, one _fake_ escape route. I need these guys off my ass, and to do that, I need them to lose track of me." He explained, while also turning over his lute, fiddling with it for some reason "so here's your story, I busted in here, and jumped out that window. you two are just terrified of the commotion, and while that happens, I'm going to hide right in here, and their going to off on a wild goose chase to find me outside somewhere in the festival." Eliran looked up at the two, "make sense?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

Nokri glanced pointedly at Aldus. The dresser they had used to barricade the door was already sliding forth a tiny bit as the forceful door knocking pushed it away. Nokri briefly considered just jumping out the window herself to escape having to deal with this predicament, but then she'd have a lot more bodily issues to deal with than a cut shoulder. "Where exactly do you plan to hide? They'd probably notice someone sitting under a pile of covers."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-17*

"I'm going to do something I haven't done in a while." Eliran sighed, gesturing towards the room's armoire,"I'm going to hide in the closet."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

"Whatever. Go ahead." Nokri hadn't put anything in the closet so she didn't really care, and wouldn't care either way if they found their sudden guest hiding there or not. She looked at Aldus, "you alright with that?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-17*

Aldus sigh deeply "I suppose if it fails I could probably outrun those brutes, I dont think its the best idea, but there doesnt seem to be alot of options here at the moment"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2017-12-17*

Eliran felt a sigh of relief coming on _you're not out of this yet boy_ he reminded himself, "Perfect, lets do this" he said, as he finished fiddling with the lute to procure a small blade that was hidden within it. He showed it to the two as he climbed into the armoire, cramped but posed to hop out, "just in case." he clarified.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-17*

`Aside: end!`

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

```Location: Trail to Bandit Hideout
Characters: Elfriede, Afina```

Afina's eyebrows raised in surprise. Elfriede had seemed so tired beforehand, where had this new energy come from? This was another side of Elfriede, she thought. The confident, military Elfriede seemed much more comfortable than the tired, forced escort side.  "Splurge?" she laughed. "As a noble, were you not going to already?". She laughed for a second, before realizing what he had said. "Wait... You said your family... is _allowing_ you to splurge? As if this isn't a common occurrence?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-19*

The almost...off... question caught Elfriede off guard.

"N-no it is indeed not. My family is much too because with military duties and keeping up appearances to take too much time off."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

Afina blinked, before hesitantly laughing. "Of course! That would only make sense that such a dignified family would be careful with monetary matters". She nods. "Complete sense." Lowering her voice she leans over closer. "Do you think this mission will truly conclude easily and peacefully? What if the bandits have already woken?"

Afina's eyes go wide and she bites her lip. "Or worse."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-19*

Elfriede raised his eyebrows slightly. 

"Does you family really take that much leisure time?" 

He had thought thier families to be of similar stature but the only families in Eraia that take trivial vacations and get aways are the families so powerful noone would ever think they could attain such stature and the families blessed by the church. Maybe Afina's Family was more powerful then he had first come to believe. Her nature made it seem like she wasnt one of such---- nevermind. He'd make it a point to mind himself more around her.

"We can never be sure, but Atalantia is a strong one, I dont expect that injured bandits will get the best of her. Plus *she* insisted,"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

Afina shrugged. She knew that some of the schools in Laera charged exorbitant tuition fees, depending on the prestige. This was much of the reason that Laera received nobles of all walks of life to study. Furthermore, much of the profit from the schools was taxed, therefore ending up in her family's coin purse. Not to say Laera's intellectual ideals were false. But it certainly didn't hurt that the king promoted the schools that made his family money. Afina knew all this, and for the most part, elected to ignore it. Dirty money didn't feel quite as nice to spend. "I... I don't think that's quite it. What if she. Defects to her own kind?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-19*

"She what? I didn't really get that indication that she would-- "
Afina's ignorance on Laguz shocked even Elfriede who felt uncomfortable around his own kind.
"She seemed the honorable type, if not a bit strange."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-19*

"Of course. Honor, and all. That is my hope as well". Afina shook her head, regretting that they had split their party. The worry was making her feel sick. She abruptly tried to change topics. "And our plan after this? An inn, yes?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"If we are able yes, I'm sure our whole group would appreciate it, cept maybe Atalantia, she'd probably prefer the ground or a pelt. Unless... We'll have to ask around, I don't know how far to a town with an inn, Ransford might know if we ask him when this ordeal is done. Or he might want to have nothing to do with us only time will tell."
Elfriede chuckles loudly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina relaxed. Elfriede didn't like the laguz topic, that much was clear. She wouldn't bother him about it now; they had at least a few more days of travel to discuss such things. And then after that... she preferred not to think about that either. "Shocking, really. One would think him to adore our company by now. This is the most behaved I've seen his men in our time here." Afina glanced behind them, at the steady faces and gruff expressions following them. "You certainly have more energy than most of them."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

Elfriede smirks, "I appreciate the compliment, although most of them are stationed here everyday while I've been given more freedom, more missions that require travel. I probably have mysister to thank for that, so I can't take all the credit, but thank you Lady Afina.

When we arrive in Eraia proper I can show you around if you like. I've been to some of the nicer citadels that are a sight to see."

Elfriede nods at her then glances to the road ahead to make sure they were continuing in the right direction.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

Afina's eyes flashed with curiosity. "Really? Would you really do that for me!?" She clears her throat, recomposing herself. "It would be most appreciated; when granting the diplomatic visit, that's likely the intent the clergy had in sending you. You seem quite knowledgeable in your country's rich content." She follows his gaze, eyes sweeping the forest for disturbances. Any second now, more laguz bandits could jump from the bushes, ambushing the approaching garrison. "Are you sure that's what you want to do with your time spent on leave though?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"It wont take long, besides the way my family is they'd push for me to get a month of time to myself if it meant I was spending it with another noble. They are nothing if not predictable."

Elfriede glances back to Ransford and his men, they were all following dilligiantly but keeping a respectful distance which he appreciated.

"And you flatter me too much! I did get top scores of my class in the history of Eraia, its true, but I am certainly not all knowing." he said with a slight chuckle.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-20*

She nods knowingly. "Of course. I understand just as much. My father used to screen my peers as potential friends; naturally I had a very structured youth. I wonder what they would think if they saw me interacting with individuals on my own. Positively, I would think. They likely wish I read much less if that meant making friends," she shook her head with a smile, thinking of her mother and father back home. She missed Laera, but at least now she could be distracted by the knowledge and adventure ahead of her. "Nonetheless, it would be my pleasure to travel with such pleasant and learned company through Eraia. I dare to wonder what the news almanacs will think seeing a Calloran and Eraian exchanging pleasantries." Afina suddenly noticed the light ahead, reflecting on the clearing with the hideout that they had found beforehand. They were fast approaching the cabin. She gestured at Elfriede. "Have your wits about you, I believe we're not far from the hideaway. Direct the garrison, and I'm sure the commander will handle the rest, yes?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-20*

"Yes, indeed I'm sure the new would have some colorful headlines for that-- Ah we're almost there already? I lost track of time, perhaps we can continue this conversation later."

Elfriede turns around and motions for Ransford to move up to inform him. He was left with a strange feeling of... fullfillment? He wasnt sure. He hadn't made any friends in a *very* long time. Faun wasn't sure what to make of it, but... it felt right. He smiled at the adventure ahead; Elfriede hadn't been this excited in a long while.

[End Aside]

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

```Location: Outside Bandit Hideout
Characters: Elfriede, Afina```

Afina briskly walked out the front door, Elfriede following close behind. By now, the garrison had swarmed inside the small hideout, preparing to attack the base. Afina closed the door behind them, and quickly checked that the windows were closed, before addressing the knight lieutenant. "Elfriede, I inspected the hideout myself, and there were no signs of struggle. Atalantia must have gone willingly. And if that's the case, then we came out here-- we were influenced to come out here!-- for nothing! And for Atalantia to defect--." Afina pauses as her voice breaks and she can feel her eyes burn with tears. Afina had to admit, up until this point, she had been exceedingly lonely. Despite her questionable laguz affiliation, Afina had been willing to give Atalantia the benefit of the doubt. After all, a political alliance would have bolstered her _own_ reputation as well. Afina huffs. "I simply cannot believe that this happened."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

"I felt the very same, but her motivations... I cannot believe that she would just abandon everything she had come here for to join some bandit nobodies. She may be tribal but she is still royalty... or at least whatever is akin to royalty among the tribes. You saw how she reacted to the Laguz in the shack, she was mortified what they had become."
Elfriede's hands tighten into fists. 
"Although, I embathize with your feeling of grief and betrayal."
Seing her current pain he takes a few steps foward and gently places one hand on her shoulder while keeping a respectful distance.
"We'll get through this. Theres probably and explanation for all of this." He tried to comfort her, although he may yet believe it himself.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

Afina shakes her head, eyes cast downwards. "I do not want to believe that she joined them willingly. But think about it. We were not awfully kind when we first tried to decide our course at the checkpoint. Harboring all that animosity, and reacting with her instincts, it's incredibly likely that she sought companions more... similar to..." Afina furrowed her eyebrows, searching for words. More her kind? No, Atalantia was nothing like the ruffians they fought earlier. "Less judgemental companionship. They would have wanted her brute strength and determination among their ranks." She takes a deep breath. "I feel I played a negative role in all of this, when all I've been trying to do is good."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

"Lady Tyndall, you've done nothing but make decisions with what you were given. You werent the Laguz robbing innocent people on the road, you wanted to do something about it. That cant be said for many leaders. And while it did diverge us from our original objective, we try our best with what were given. Please. Do not blame yourself for any of this. ...And as for Atalantia, lets not jump to any conclusions. Although I'd be heartbroken to find out that she did;  I had thought us just starting to bond." Elfriede glances down and frowns.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

"I won't forgive her if she has changed allegiances," Afina stated flatly. "To give her the benefit of my doubt, and herself still give in to her wilder nature..." Afina could feel the burning sensation once more in her eyes, and quickly rubbed her eyes, passing it off as fatigue. "And now, this mission? No tactician would agree to it. If Ransford wants to commit suicide, he should refrain from taking his troops with him. Must we acquiesce his decision?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

Seeing the sadness in her eyes he was trying to think of something to change the topic, but to be honest this was bothering him too, thus all he could think about. "It's up to Ransford what he wants to do with his troops. I am not under his Jurisdiction though. Even if he is a superior officer. We could try to convince him otherwise but... " Elfriede bites his tongue again briefly and glances down. "I'm a bit worried about Atalantia..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

"We have a duty to rescue her, as it is the assumption that she's still... with us. And clearly we're strong enough to do so. But the fatigue and the mental anguish truly has taken a toll. And yourself! Elfriede, without magic, you would no longer be standing!" Afina wiped her eyes again, more vigorously this time. "I don't mean to play into stereotypes, but there is only so much a princess can take in a 24 hour timespan. And while I'm comforted that I have very devout support--." She nodded in his direction. "I am not quite sure I'm prepared for what lies ahead, whatever it may be."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

"You make a point that's hard to argue against. We need rest. But time is a precious commodity when it comes to hostages. Most are ... *(Elfriede winces)* dealt with.... within the first 48 hours."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

"Every second matters in such a situation," Afina took a deep breath. "Hopefully a tremendous effort now will mean all the more lavish sleeping quarters later. And we rightfully deserve a long rest once this matter is dealt with. At a proper inn."

Afina manages a slight laugh. "Though to see the commander's face at the idea of myself in combat. That almost makes it worth the effort."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

Elfriede smiles, "When we get to any sort of town that has a lavish inn we are definitely staying. We've earned it." He wanted to go on about how in the capitol he heard about how amazing Eraian spa inns were but the gloom hanging over them stole away his excitement and his smile quickly faded. 

"..If Ransford plans on going in tonight, well make them pay for all the hardship they've caused us."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

"Of course," Afina says, walking towards the door to re-enter the cabin and join Ransford's troops. "That being said, however, try not to become too inundated this time around," she giggled.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

Elfriede scowled back at her, then his face shifted closer to determined. "I won't be caught so off guard this time... Afina" A new determined fire began crackling inside him.  He'd show her when he was chosen for this mission, why he has the title of knight-leiutenant.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

Afina tried to glare at him, but couldn't help but crack a slight smile. "Then prove it," she said with a smirk, opening the door to rejoin with Ransford's forces.

[END LE ASIDE]

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

```Location: Outside Bandit Hideout
Characters: Elfriede, Afina, Ransford```

After their private talk the two rejoin Ransford to assess the situation a bit.

"Commander Ransford, how did you want to go about this. Even with these numbers, do you want to risk this complex? You've proved reliable so far, I trust your judgement."

**Bill** - *2017-12-22*

Ransford gives you a look and continues ushering men down the trapdoor. 

"We don't have any other option Faun, it's not the best scenario but I'd prefer this to the alternative."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

He glances awkwardly at Afina and back to Ransford. 

"We can lead if you'll let us. We should take responsibility for our failure to search before leaving. Plus, with all due respect, I think we've seen more combat that most of the soldiers here."

He slightly nods at Ransford.

**Bill** - *2017-12-22*

"Yet you failed to follow the most basic of procedure in dangerous scenario, putting us in this lot to begin with. Even with your decorations for service Faun if you can't manage that I'd rather have a green man any day." He hasn't looked at you, basically talking over his shoulder. 

"Nor is there any reason for to leave, asides from the notion you think you make up for earlier mistakes. Now is not the time." He finally looks over at you, then to Afina. 

"Are you sure it's wise to be coming with us at all?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-22*

"Are you turning down the offered assistance of one of the most proficient light mages in the area, for a fight that is tactically unwise?" She said, folding her arms.

She quickly adds. "As well as one of the most skilled and honored knight lieutenants in the country?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-22*

"Milady Tyndall, I mean that you are a guest in Eraia and this has nothing to with your visit. Not it is common for a bodyguard and his escort to join in on military matters." Ransford says likes he said it 100 times before. 

"I offer no commentary to either of your combat ability. Simple about the *roles* we are required to play." He says pointedly to Afina.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-22*

Elfriede scowls at Ransford again. It's like he doesnt want to do anything, to get by day by day without having to do anything. Elfriede's always hardworking nature couldnt see the value in a life like that. He felt his face heat up as Ransford insulted him again.

"Why did you even come out here? None of your soldiers nor national security is threatened. If you were content just guarding the border why are you even here. This wasnt a miltary matter until *you* made it one."

"If you trusted us enough to come out here on our word, then allow us to play our part."

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

"I trusted you to escort the princess to Trisp. You thus far have everything but." Ransford says matter o factly. He doesn't bother to look your way. 

"If you wish to continue ignoring that role, I can't blame you. Your companion is MIA. That's enough of a reason to continue on." Most of the men have dropped down to the door by now.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina nods. "To be fair. His charge wished to derail this mission. If anything, he's following orders by remaining faithfully by her side." She smiles at Elfriede. "So do you accept our assistance in combat then?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

"Milady, if I may so bold to say, I haven't tried to stop you from doing a single thing. That's not my role."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

"You are talking us in circles Commander. Were not getting anywhere with this. I have done nothing wrong in terms of military conduct. I'm doing as the Lady wishes; do you wish for me to knock her out and CARRY her back to the city?"

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

Ransford swivels. "And that right there is insubordination. Watch your tone Faun. I had been under the impression you and Milady Tyndall were joining this mission either way. If you want my blessing I won't give it and you can stay here. I wouldn't recommend it though, as Milady's spell likely revealed our approach long before we arrived. It's quite likely they'll be circling around another entrance looking to get us from behind." He glowers. 

"If you have anything else say it now, as we have a building to clear." His eyes flick towards the trapdoor, motioning for you to go ahead.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2017-12-23*

Elfriede scowls at him again, and walks around the commander and toward the trap door. He stops briefly motioning for Afina to follow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2017-12-23*

Afina opens her mouth to argue, but knows better than to. She lowers her head and follows Elfriede.

**Bill** - *2017-12-23*

Ransford watches the two drop down into the trapdoor. He uncharacteristically sighed. Better they were within sight than off in the front, especially if the worst happens and their friend was in trouble. A wry grin crosses his features as he rolls his shoulders and steps towards the door himself. *"What happened to he's too injured to fight properly?"*

`end aside`

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

```
Location: Camp, Morning
Asided from: Road to Eraia 
Characters: Aldus. Nokri
```

It’s mid morning but Aldus has been up since dawn, it’s their second day on the road. He’s already packed their things, done his regular workout routine, and put out their fire. Nokri is still asleep and if yesterday morning is any clue she will be for a lot longer if Aldus does not wake her up. He thinks back to yesterday morning’s case of trying to wake her up and shudders. Although it’s not much, he has a few pieces of cured meat, a roll, and some nuts as a breakfast peace offering. 

He nudges her gently and says in a low voice “Nokri we need to get up and get moving, I have foooood”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

The sun was bright. The ground was hard. Life was unbearable. It was almost like camping in the military again, except instead of being surrounded by dozens of dirty and sweaty sick people there was this canine accompanying her. Would this trip really be worth it?

She felt a nudge and let out a low "ugh," almost like a growl. She didn't bother moving at first, but the smell of something edible was enough to at least make her sit up. "How much farther do we have to go to the next town?" she asked groggily, rolling up the cloth she slept on and looking around expectantly for the promised food.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

"hmmmm"  he sits down the plate of food and pulls out the map from the map tube on his belt "proabbly sometime around tommorow afternoon, if you get up that is"  He rolls the map back up and sticks it back its place, and gets up.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

Eagerly taking the plate of food, she picked up a piece of meat and cautiously examined it for a moment before popping it in her mouth. "Hmmph," she responded with a full mouth. That didn't sound too bad, but it meant another night of camping. "We have enough food for that?" Stuffing the rest of the plate's contents in her mouth, she stood up, dusting the dirt off her shirt.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

*what a strange creature* "nope its all gone now,  you just ate my very last provision, so now we will starve and die..." he shrugs and and picks up his pack. then smiles toothly at her - obviously being sarcastic

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

Nokri exhaled slowly and stared at him, unamused. 
(ಠ_ಠ)
*How tasty is laguz meat?* she pondered offhandedly, *and how much is it worth on the black market?* Packing up her stuff, she gave the camp a cursory look-over to ensure nothing would get left behind. "Guess we'll have to walk fast. Takes at least 3 days to starve to death. What a shame."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

Aldus rolls his eyes "Lighten up would you? Im just kidding I have plenty of provisons, I'm used to the whole 'traveling and camping thing'  plus even if we were out I'd just hunt for food *for both of us*" he emphasises the last part, feeling a little  unapprieced and more than a little annoyed *should have just left her here*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

"Oh, so you can hunt in your... condition?" It hadn't crossed her mind that a laguz who couldn't transform could still hunt. Nokri very much wanted to see Aldus chasing after a rabbit, barking and running on his hands and knees. The thought alone caused a rare smirk. "Don't your kind usually hunt in packs?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

Aldus laughs for a good while then looks at her "Oh, oh wait your serious? Hello?" he says pointing to his bow slung across his back "Didnt it occur to you that a laguz that cant transform would be much like you raverage human? And how do humans hunt? Oh right.... with *bows* which I happen to have, and happen to be *pretty* decent with.  And yes they- mean we- do hunt in apcks. In my pack I would provide long range support" with everything packed up they begin walking

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

All this explanation did was conjure up an image of dogs trying to shoot arrows. Would they pull the bow back using their paws, or their mouth? Curious. 
Nokri matched his stride, thinking about dogs and bows and arrows. "So have you *never* been able to transform?" she asked. If they were going on some great quest to find a way for Aldus to transform, she figured it would help to know a bit about the patient. "Ever?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

*rub it in why dont you, she probably doesnt mean anyhting by it though* "No, never not even once, most of my friends were able to transform by 15 - uhh 17 at the latest" but he gets quiter "buy uh- not me"  he puts his hands into his pockets and starts at the road ahead, feeling a little awkward.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

"Wow that sucks," she said in her usual flat voice. Ignoring the awkwardness, she continued on.  "Maybe it was something you ate? Does it run in the family? Catch any funky viruses when you were a kid?" Ruling all of those out, Nokri had no clue what might've caused the transformation issue.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

*you're telling me* "Something I ate?" He stares increduously at her " Ugh, No definetly not. It doesnt run the family. No one from home has ever heard of anyhting like this. And also no I was a perfect child"  realising what he said he backs up "I mean a perfectly normal child"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-28*

*Note to self: don’t rule out food as a possibility.* She raised an eyebrow, “sounds like a story. An embarrassing childhood story.” She could pester it out of him, but doing so would annoy her as well and put a damper on their road trip.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-28*

*what kinda crack potion maker does she think she is?* "there is no embarring story, I mean at least not that has anyhting to do with *that* Anyway, what about you? Was any of that stuff you told that fancy sage guy true?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

"The what now?" She had already forgotten most of the tale, and strained to remember its details. "Oh. Yeah, sure." She didn't feel like explaining something new or sharing her actual backstory.  Couldn't let him have any blackmail material on her. "Do you think that old geezer really was the Great Sage? Maybe if he was he got a good impression of us. Do you think he got a good impression of us?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

"So, No then? I figured you were lying but now its just obvious. Come on I've told you a lot about me. Tell me something about you! Are you really Drecian?" He completely ignored her question, not really caring what some Thenovain Elder thinks of him by this point.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

"Who, me?" She switched back into a stereotypically sweet accent, entirely changing her demeanor. "Why, heavens to Lylalel, no! You heard what I said back at the observatory." She dramatically placed the back of her hand on her forehead, "such a tragic thing. How *could* you make me recall those events again?" She switched back to her usual dry self. "I'd like to see if that old guy really was a sage. Boils my blood to think he was just off his rocker and playing us for fools."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

Aldus  feels his right eye twitch. *fine if that how you want to do it* "Oh so you're a follower of Lylalel then? That'll be handy when we get into Eraia. I don't know much about The Godless myself, but maybe you'd like to try and convert me? I've always wanted to be shown the true light" He says sarcastically, drawing out he last two words

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

"I won't push my religion down your throat, Lylalel is merciful and kind and all that." She tried brushing off his comments, since Nokri hadn't the slightest idea about any religious matters. Most of the time she just spouted nonsense and people went right along with it or left her alone. "Do your people have some kind of religion? Do you worship a giant bone and leave dead prey on doorsteps as offerings."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

"mmmhmmmm...." *does she really think shes convincing?* He was half expecting a a slap in the face for that comment, if she could reach him that was. Her second comment reveals a new ignorance in her, well- *No time like the present for some education I guess* "My people - and by people here I mean Wynnites - that would be *humans* and wolf laguz believe that our ancestors are 'reincarnated' and manifest themselves in the blessings - or curses- or our lives" he laughs *I don't think my ancestors like me very much* he thinks but doesn't say allowed

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

"Wow, fascinating." She raised an eyebrow, confused at his sudden laughter. Did he think his ancestors were going to curse her? *Good thing religion is nonsense, I'd of been smited long ago.* "If they manifest as blessings, do you think some of them could manifest as a wad of cash right now? That would be nice." She shifted the weight of her bag, as though expecting it to suddenly get heavier with gold and money. Alas, it did not.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

"If only... Na its not like that its more like, when a deer crosses your path after several hours sitting in the cold and waiting everyone's all like 'thank the ancestors for this blessing, oh those great and wise that came before us' and blah blah blah"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2017-12-29*

"A deer? That's it? Not even, like, a herd of deer?" Pfft. If anything should be considered a miracle, it would be a a piping hot 5 star buffet jumping out of the trees. As they walked, Nokri would occasionally glance at the weeds growing along the pathside, or leaves in the trees. All common junk, but if they were to pass an interesting herb she would quickly pluck it and stuff it in her pocket before moving on.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2017-12-29*

Her tone makes him chuckle a little "You're funny, you know that? You still need to lighten up though"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-02*

```
Location: Bandit Hideout, After fight
Characters: Elfriede, Afina, (Ransford is there with his remaining troops)
```

Faun braced himself and shielded his eyes as a wave of warmth passed over him. It abruptly ended and in a slightly panicked state he glanced back to see who he thought was attacking him curled up into a ball on the ground. He paused and then breathed a sigh of relief realizing what had happened. Faun looked over to Afina, who was suddenly closer, as she spoke to him. She played as though she was completely collected after the fight, but her voice betrayed her.

“I had him. He stood no chance. Did you really think that he was going to..” Elfriede sounded more like he was trying to convince himself than her. He awkwardly glances away avoiding eye contact. “Thank you for the help Lady Afina. It was indeed closer then I would have wished.” Elfriede grimaced a bit and looked down. He was a bit disappointed in himself lately and clearly she was worried that he was going to get hurt as well. "Quite unbecoming of a knight of Eraia."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

"Nonsense, no one is perfect. Just look at all the blood we managed to lose during this fight," Afina said, gesturing to the dried blood on her arm and his nose. She laughed gently. "Though, how ironic that we sustained exactly the same injuries." Noticing Elfriede’s avoiding gaze, she cocked her head, trying to look him in the eye. “Are you alright?” she asked. Elfriede was normally quite responsive and receptive to speaking with her. Was he ashamed that he had needed help? 

A pang of guilt ran through Afina. She didn’t regret helping the knight lieutenant; his life had been at risk. But perhaps she could have done so without being as much of a show-off. She was a proficient light mage, and she liked to remind everyone of it. But Elfriede’s ego had already taken enough of a hit in the cabin earlier that day. _He_ was supposed to be protecting _her_.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-02*

Elfriede rubbed his face in a bad attempt to remove the blood.

"Yes, I suppose I'm alright... Are you?"

 He reformed eye contact with Afina, glanced around her lightly bruised face and at the blood. Again cringing a bit at the blood he'd thought hed most likely never see on her. How ridiculous they both must look right now. Worrying while both thier faces covered in blood. Elfriede couldn’t name the the exact thing that did it to him, but he found himself unable to hold a grimace. He soon was smirking, then smiling, then finally he burst out laughing for a few seconds.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-02*

Afina relaxed as Elfriede laughed, and found herself smiling along. “Yes, I’m alright,” she nodded. “The blood may not make it look so, but a simple nosebleed is something any princess can handle.” Afina made a mental note to stay away from the upper level light spells next bandit encounter. It would be a convenient method of practice, but she wasn’t going to risk Elfriede’s pride. 

“However, I would nobly recommend you not stray too far next time. I wasn’t _worried_ exactly, but. There is a deep level of concern when you’re separated from your company in a laguz-infested base,” she smiled, hoping to make light of the situation. After a long night’s rest, hopefully Elfriede would have his own mental fortitude in dealing with his… shortcomings. Afina hoped so, at least. Despite his performance today, Afina still trusted him to be a proper escort in their voyage. She understood that he was committed to keeping her safe, at least mentally, even if he physically did not fulfill his own expectations.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-03*

Elfriede slowed his laughter and landed in a smirk. Afina's face was really caring, far more caring then he probably deserved. When they first met he expected what she was at face value, as most people do. She seemed arrogant and niave. While she certainly has those traits to an extent...
"At least I get to escort pleasant company, who can also defend *themselves*. Careful princess, dont make my job too easy." Faun chuckles a bit.

Fauns mind wanders back to the task at hand and his face returns to serious. 
"Lets hope Atalantia is alright as well, I was just getting to like her."
He tilts his head towards Ransford and the remaining soldiers. "Shall we?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

"Of course, _Sir Faun_," she nods, shifting into step with Elfriede and hooking her arm around his, in the proper mannerisms of escorting a princess. She leans over slightly, muttering under her breath. "Try not to give Ransford too much praise. He was most impressive in combat, but he's _already_ as pompous as a peacock. I hate to think how much worse he could be with a stroked ego."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-03*

Faun had glanced at Ransford and tensed at Afina's sudden closeness, but then relaxed after he looked back and realized what she was doing. He has escorted more haughty types then her who **refused** to be walked any other way.

*Elfriede moves towards Ransford with Afina. Faun briefly thinks about Ransford with a big head.* 

"Eghk."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

"Commander, do any of your men know where we can find Atalantia?" Afina asks, though her tone of voice sounds more like a demand. Clearly, the princess was tired enough as it was; she wanted the ordeal done with as soon as possible.

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

"No more than they did a minute ago." Ransford says, directing men about as they scurry to tie others up. 

"They knew we were coming, so we'd best hurry." he says quietly.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Afina hesitates. "And so... where are we going? The hexagonal pulley in the center of the room surely seems promising," she inquires, eyebrows starting to furrow.

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

Ransford turns around and looks up and down the pulley system. 

"I expect that's for loading their pillagings up. We're better off sticking to the halls." he says after taking the in the system for a moment. He glances over his remaining troops. 

"We three can go ahead." he says before raising his voice for the rest of the room. "Catch up when you have them secured!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

"Well why don't we just lower it ever so slightly and I can shine a light down? Didn't you just reprimand Elfriede for not having thorough security of the room before?" Afina asks, breaking her hold on Elfriede to step forward.

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

"The winch is in this room. WIth no one to operate it in this room it won't lower to let anyone in."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

"And if the forces here are ambushed again? Your men fought valiantly, but what if they are overwhelmed by a secondary force that aims to lower the pulley for their comrades below? We've been ambushed from below once, I would prefer it didn't happen again."

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

"Do what you wish Lady Tyndall." Ransford says.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Afina blinks a few times, shocked that Ransford had conceded to her idea. "Elfriede, can you use the winch while I illuminate the room below?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-03*

*Elfriede nods and moves over the winch controls* "Might as well take a look."

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

The winch rotates easily. The hex peice in the floor moves easily, and after a few rotations you can see below. Quite a ways down down you can see the grassy forest floor.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Afina peers down, wavering fearfully when she realized how far down the exit was. And how close to the edge _she_ was. Afina takes a step back, the light beneath her snuffing off. "Very well. That business is taken care of. Have you sent a scout to see how far down the hallway is? If Atalantia is close?"

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

"Look for yourself. You can see how every man in this company is busy." Ransford says with an aside look. "We're as close to scouts as you're going to get."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-03*

"One way is as good as any at this point. I guess we follow Ransford?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-03*

Afina hesitates. She detested every second she spent in Ransford's company. Anyone who gave her pushback was someone to be avoided. Saying nothing, Afina simply nods.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

```Location: In an alleyway near the Inn, post escape
Characters: Eliran, Aldus, Nokri (unconscious)```

Turning the corner, Eliran found his new accomplices, as they most likely have already been deemed. He looked to Aldus, who was still carrying the small unconscious girl, "well that was probably one of the worst ways that could have gone..." Eliran said, huffing a little at what happened.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Aldus grimaces at the pain in his entire torso as a wave of anger hits him.  "Looks like your plan didn't work to well Lute Boy" he snaps at him, then takes a deep breath, steadying himself yet again. "sorry- I know you didn't mean for that to happen, and I appreciate the effort, I've know a few who would have left me - i mean us- for dead but... now we both have issues, I'm in no condition to keep fighting and Nokri here- well as you can see shes down for the count." *I hope she'll be okay*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Eliran made a sad expression, "I'm sorry, I never wanted anybody to get hurt or involved..." He sighed, unsure what to say, "look, I promised you a room at least, if we can sneak to another inn I'll get you one from somebody who will keep quiet about your staying there."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Aldus looks up at the stranger from where he is leaned down next to Nokri's body. His eyes narrow as he assesses the man, he has a roguish look about him but a kind face, and his offer seems in earnest.  "that would be..... most appreciated, as I'm sure you're aware of we cant exactly leave town just yet and we only arrived her a few hours ago, I would assume a room may be hard to find though what with the festival going on and all"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

At that Eliran grinned, "Maybe for normal travellers, but where do you think the entertainment stays?" He said, shouldering his lute case to make it more obvious. "When I came in town I asked a few innkeepers to have a room for me ready in return for performing. It helps when you need to crash in an emergency."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Aldus cocks his head *multiple rooms huh?* "Well, that's pretty smart." Aldus stands. "I'm Aldus by the way, what was your name again? I admit I was a little flustered before when you told me"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Eliran offers a hand for a handshake, "I am Eliran Cantaret, one of Theanovene's most talented musicians"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-03*

Aldus gets the feeling that he should recongize the name. returning the handshake he says "Ah well, I'd say its nice too meet you Eliran, but.." He trails off "Oh and this is Nokri" he says motioning to the still body on the ground "she uh isn't too useful in a fight, hopefully she'll wake up soon" he says sounding concerned.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-03*

Raising an eyebrow, Eliran asks, "So... is she your wife or was that an act, cause if it wasn't you guys must be in a pretty bad marriage..."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-04*

Aldus looks confused for a second "my what? Ohh, oh, ancestors no, im pretty sure she hates me actually. We're just uhhh, traveling companions? shes helping me with my..... something." Aldus leans down to pick up Nokri "Im going to have to carry her"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-04*

"Okay good" Eliran said with a laugh, "lets get moving then, once we get to the inn, I'll see if we can find a healer there."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-11*

[End Aside]

```
Location: Evard, Hylley
Asided from: Festival Square 
Characters: Aldus. Nokri, Eliran
```
As he follows Eliran he begins to feel movement against his chest - Norki. A wave of relief flows over him *she’s ok* Instead of knocked out she seems more asleep judging by the way she’s… nuzzling him? *Yea definitely not fully conscious yet* She stirs a little more and then jolts almost completely out of his grasp, for a second he’s concerned he’s dropped her but then she backs away from him and Eliran demanding answers in a Drecian accent. *knew she was actually Drecian* he thinks to himself, Snapping back to the task at hand he attempts to answer her. 

“Nokri - listen, and please try to keep it down. What happened in the inn back there, well lets just say it didn’t go very well. Now I know what you’re going to say - he’s the reason we are even in this position in the first place” He motions to Eliran “But Eliran is trying to make it up to us by finding us a new place to let us wait out the night, but we need to get there undetected, and that requires us acting unsuspicious”

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-11*

A glare of death was directed towards Eliran, or at least as much of a death glare as Nokri could muster while trying not to fall over sideways. "Great," she muttered through gritted teeth. Some passerby were already rubbernecking at the trio, wherein the unconscious little girl had suddenly become hostile towards her companions. Grumpier than usual, Nokri inched a bit closer back towards the guys. "Where are we going."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-11*

She sounded even more sour than usual, which Aldus wasn't even sure was possible but apparently it was "A different inn, Eliran allegedly has a room at another inn on the other side of town, we just need to get there, once we get there we can wait till morning and leave as soon as possible"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-11*

"Allegedly?" Eliran said raising an eyebrow, "In all honesty, we are already pretty safe here, I doubt they'd make a scene with this many people, especially since the guards are around." He continued, gestering to the festival. "As long as we stay between the  Inn and here, we'll be fine."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-11*

"Excuse me I didn't mean to.... Anyway, the faster we get to the inn the better. While I would have liked to enjoy the festivities more I simply don't think that to be a very smart decision. Nokri, you still seem rather... Joustled? If you'd like I *could* carry you the rest of the way." He offers.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-11*

While the festival sure seemed like a hip hullabaloo, Nokri wasn't in a very playful mood. Her clear vision was coming back and the ringing was gradually fading but she wasn't about to go join in the dancing. Aldus's proposition was very tempting and sounded very appealing, but no way in heck was Nokri letting him pick her up again. She probably already owed him one for the carrying he had done thus far, and even though she had no intention of repaying him whatsoever, she didn't like the idea of him having an advantage over her. "No." She sniffed her shoulder, thinking *I probably reek of sweat and laguz and blood. Great.*
"I'm fine. Lets go." She bumped Eliran and Aldus's sides as though prodding them on, oblivious to the latter's injury.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-11*

As Nokri bumps him another pain shoots through his rib causing him to buckle slightly, grabbing the area in pain. To onlookers it may appear that Nokri had punched him in the stomach, at least that be be easier to explain than what really happened. He looks up, defeated and says to Eliran "I don't think she she knows where shes going, we'd better catch up"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-11*

Eliran winces at the sight of Nokris bump into Aldus, "need a hand?" He asked, clearly concerned about the man's injury.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-15*

```Location: The Cheerful Sparrow
                          Historic Inn on the Festival Grounds
       Characters: Serra, Eliran, Aldus, Nokri. ```

Eliran walks up to the bar and takes a seat in front of Serra. As he leans forward, he also lifts his mask to reveal his face. "Do you mind if we use the room I got earlier?" he asks, with a clear sound of familiarity in his voice.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

As they walk in to the inn Aluds overhears a patrons rude comment, his brow furrows slighty at the words but the woman behind the bar quickly proves she can fend for herself. The three of them saddle up the bar as the woman addresses them. Aldus removes his mask, awknowledging the womans request and awaits her response.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-25*

Nokri barely has the will to sit upright, let alone take off the stupid mask.  She takes a seat and grudgingly puts the mask on the bar, not wanting to upset their potential host and get them kicked out. Several coins earned from the mask stall were placed beside the mask. "Also, one of whatever your strongest drink is," she requested while cradling her head.

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

"What'd you do, lose your key?" Serra asks with a raised eyebrow. She looks over Nokri for a moment before shrugging and pulling a obsidian black bottle from under the counter. There's no label on it. She starts to mix a drink starting the the black bottles amber contents as a base.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Eliran gave a small nervous laugh, "I kinda did.... todays been a bit crazy..."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

Aldus wonders idly about whether or not Nokri should drink while recovering from a concussion, but decides its not his business. "I'll atest to that" Aldus says, seconding Elirans statement

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Serra gives Eliran a dirty look for a moment. She adds a spice of some kind to Nokri's drink. 

"Keys aren't cheap you know. Are you trying to stick me with the replacement costs?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

Aldus sifts around in his belt pouch for awhile and pulls outs a coin and places it on the table, "Does this cover it? We really dont mean to be of trouble."

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

"Hon, you have a pretty face but you aren't terrible swift are you?" She laughs. "The room alone was 10 gold, and while that's terribly inflated a tenth of that doesn't cover the labor on a key."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Eliran looks apologetically, "I'm sorry ok? I'll help you cover it, its just I got involved with a bit of trouble." he says, "and you take that back, I said I'd take care of a room for you two for causing you trouble"

"Serra please just let us get the night overwith, you know I can help earn the losses back"

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Serra places a drink down in front of Nokri. "It's a gold piece, but it'll be worth your while. Just uh. Don't lose your friend when you finish this alright?" Serra says.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-25*

Aldus snatches his coin back up from the table. "Well in *that* case..."  feeling a wave of annoyance at the women.

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

"5 gold, and 20 if I don't have the key in my hand at sunrise." Serra says as she takes another order.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Eliran sighs, "could you at least give me till sunset tomorrow? theres no point in getting the room if I have to be up all night to find the key. "

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

"This key." She says, pulling one off the unlabeled rack behind her. "If I don't see this key it's 20."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

Eliran now gives a sigh of relief, "thanks. If you want I can come down later to entertain this lot for you" he said pointing to the group behind him

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

"They're plenty entertained by their own navels, as you can tell." She comments dryly. "I'll be fine with my gold."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-25*

"If you say so, I was just offering as an extra service considering" Eliran said as he fished out five gold for her.

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Serra sweeps the gold off the counter in a quick motion and passes a beer to another patreon. She drops the key in front of you and nods once. 

"Then have a good night." She says and she steps down the bar to serve the other side.

(ooc: Serra is effectively done here)

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-26*

```Location: The Cheerful Sparrow, Room 20X
Characters: Eliran, Aldus, Nokri```

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-26*

"well it isn't much, but at least its free" Eliran said as he entered the room. "You two can choose who gets the bed, after all the trouble I've caused I can't take it."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Aldus enters the room and quickly sets down his bag on the floor, then unlatches his belt of pouches and unbuckles his leather chest plate. He removes his tunic to examine the bruising on his abdomen, tossing the garment on top of his other belongings. The area is red and stings even at the lightest of touches. He looks into a small mirror placed on the desk and examines his face which looks even worse with black and blue marks already forming. He puts a hand to his chin and flexes his jaw a little to listen for cracks, luckily the cosmetic damage is all there seems to be.  Amongst all this worry over his injuries he seemingly doesn't hear Eliran and instead turns to Nokri “Would you happen to have any herbs or a solve for this?” he moves his hand in a sweeping motion from his face down his body, acknowledging the bruising. “I think he fractured my rib as well” Aldus continues while prodding at his ribs to find which one is damaged.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-26*

Carrying the remainder of her half-finished drink up the steps, Nokri wobbled into the room. It had been a while since she drank, since before they had left Theanovene. Whatever was in that mug was strong all right, and did a good job dulling the pain. "'m gonna leave this here for you," she said quietly, dropping the drink on the desk in case one of the boys needed a pick-me-up. Making a beeline towards the bed, she threw herself onto the end horizontally. "Dibs," she exclaimed despite generously leaving enough room for at least one more person.

Nokri was ready for sleep, but half-listened to what was going on. It took a minute for her to register what Aldus said, during which time there was just silence. She rolled over regretfully, staring at him with an *are you serious?* face. Even from where she was, there was obvious swelling and bruises beginning to form. "Can you breathe?" she asked half sarcastically, slowly dragging herself upright again.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Aldus eyes Nokris drink sitting on the desk, still half full. *couldn't hurt right?* he picks it up and takes a sip, hoping  its as strong as promised and that it'll take the edge off.  He's obviously annoyed Nokri... again. He should stop letting that bother him and just get used to it. "Yes I can *breath*" he half scoffs "I just figured with all those potions and what not we picked up before we left there'd be something that could help."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-26*

"Yes, yes. Do... that." *That* meaning the drink. The drink was messing with her mind, but Nokri had seen enough bone fractures in her life to treat one while sleeping. When treating patients all she needed was for them to shut up and do what was told. "Lay down, but don't take up the whole bed" she snapped, corralling him towards the bed while poking him in the sides. She didn't ask where it hurt, she would know when he inevitably winced, or maybe even cried. What a sight that would be.
Turning to Eliran, she asked "do you have, like... a flame? Fire, something flammable?" It wasn't necessary, but Nokri appreciated the availability of a good heat source while treating patients.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-26*

Eliran raised an eyebrow, "should... you be working after what you drank...?" he asked somewhat concerned for the potion's content. "And I don't think the innkeep is going to appreciate our starting a fire in the room...."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Aldus lets Nokri "guide" him to the bed, while downing the rest of... whatever this is. "Fire? fire for what exac- Argh!" he yelps in pain as Nokri hits the spot where the fracture must be. "He makes a point... are you sure... that your okay to do this?"  he breathes while recovering from the less than gentle prod.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-26*

She laughed aloud, "'s fine. Fine." She grabbed the empty drink mug, roughly putting it down over where the confirmed fracture was. The mug was still cold enough from the drink to substitute for ice, probably. "No fire? Hmmm." She dug around in her bag, expecting Aldus not to move. An assorted bunch of grasses and leaves were taken out, and had water from a canteen poured over them. "I don't want to use the good herbs. These'll work. He's healthy enough. If it leaves a rash it won't last too long." Nokri whispered her thought process out loud unintentionally while mashing the wet plants together into some kind of poultice.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

"Wait, what?!  A rash? Are you sure this is a good Idea?" he tried to protest but its allready too late.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-26*

"S'fine. Relax." Stress was bad for patients, and also for her thin patience. She started smearing the mushy plants on his abdomen. It would tingle, especially if it came into contact with any open wounds, but Nokri didn't explain anything and just let the plants do whatever plants do. "Don't roll over or lift anything. You'll be fine." With those kind words of encouragement Nokri dropped back down on the other side of the bed, ready to count sheep and sleep.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Aldus groans and drops his arm over his eyes. *What did I get myself into* he thinks to himself. *she said don't roll over but she said nothing about getting up* Aldus gets off the bed slowly and carefully and makes his way over to the balcony door. "I think I need some air." He says to Eliran while opening the door and stepping out, he leaves the door open just in case Eliran would like to follow.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-26*

Eliran noticing the open door, decides to follow and join the Aldus on the balcony and sat down. looking towards the festival he asks, "its amazing isn't it?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-26*

Aldus takes a seat in one of the chairs set on the balcony and leans back as to not mess with whatever concoction rests on his stomach area. He pushes his discontent aside, hoping the small talk will lift his spirits. "Indeed,like nothing I've ever seen before. Celebrations back home are more... subdued? No grand performers, or circuses, no vendors such as these."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-26*

Eliran raised an eyebrow, while this festival was definitely a cut above others, for somebody from the Theanovene region, it was all pretty standard and definitely not a rare kind of event. "Sounds like a simpler place" he said nonchalantly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"Wynne, and yea... I guess it is" Aldus look up at the night sky for a long moment. "Hey I wanted to ask you something"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

"Feel free"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"I overheard those two...... Assholes saying something about a woman they had? Does that sound familiar to you at all?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

"A woman...?" Eliran thought for a second, then abruptly sat up, "Wait did you say they got her???"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"Mmhmm, one if then said something like 'hope we don't get in trouble for not finding that rat, think having the woman is enough to keep us out of trouble" Aldus reiterates in a deep, mocking tone

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

Eliran groans, "god damn it, yeah I know about that girl." he says as he scratches his head. "they're boss has been harassing her for a while now"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"I think I may be missing some key information here. I'm not sure who those men really are this entire situation has escalated way past the point I ever wanted it too" Aldus frowns and shakes his head. " What's really going on here?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

"Would you believe me if I told you I'm being hunted by a gang just because of one woman?" Eliran asked.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

Aldus shrugs "Perhaps... If you tell me whole story, then I'll let you know"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

Eliran leans back in his chair, "if only I had a drink to tell it with," he muses to himself. Looking over to Aldus, he starts, "So, and I know this is pretty obvious, I am a musician, and part of my shtick is that I often play in Inns or Taverns to earn some food or a free night."

"Its a pretty nice job, and when you travel around a lot like me it can be helpful." He continues, "So I've been in town for the past week or so. Actually I was working at the inn you two were staying at in fact."

"And the innkeepers daughter often works as a waitress or bartender." Eliran pauses, "And if you know bars, you know how the women are treated in them." He added, giving Aldus a pointed look.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"ah yes" Aldus says, remembering the repulsive behavior of even the patrons of this very establishment just minuets ago, nothing he hasn't seen before of course "like I said, assholes, that think for some reason they are entitled to whatever their worldly desires would request of them. So yea unfortunately, I know what you mean"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

((Sorry didn't see your response))

Eliran nodded, "well one guy started coming like 4 days ago. On day 1 he was your typical perv, but not to bad."

"On day two it got a little worse."

"On day three, the owner's daughter was told not to work so that she wouldn't have to deal with him." Eliran continued, his voice darkening a bit, as if to indicate increasing anger.

"Yesterday, he followed her around. I happened to be in the area." Eliran paused, taking a breath and sighing slightly. "She was scared, and he wasn't alone. It was him and a couple of his lackeys."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

The corner or Aldus's mouth twitches in discust as Eliran tells his story. He knows what he's going to say next "So you stood up for her, tried to protect her"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

"sort of..." Eliran paused, "I mean I'm not the best fighter or physically intimidating person. So I couldn't really white knight my way in there." he explained. "but I couldn't leave her there either."

"So instead of trying to be an amazing hero, I did something we bards are really really good at..." Eliran grinned, "I took a proverbial shit on him."

"Now, was it the most honorable thing to do? no. But did calling him an idiotic pig who can't take a hint get his attention? hell yes."

"So, she was able to get away, and I had a pack of gang members chasing me for calling their boss a dissembling harlot whose abilities are too infant-like for doing much at all."

"I ended up shaking them off for a while, until they found me today at the inn, and you know the rest from there."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

Aldus's eye widen as Eliran recounts the string of insults thrown at the man. He swallows and then nods his head. "I won't say you were wrong, your insults seem warrented at least. Even if you did bite off more than you can chew." Aldus considers things for a moment and then continues "But now they may have her after all? If the boss was the one who wanted this woman so badly that doesnt seem unlikely. I dont want to think about what could happen to her if that excuse for a man really does have her."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-27*

Vaguely stifled laughter and a hiccup could be heard behind them, from inside the room, as Eliran described his eloquent song about the creep. Several seconds later, the sound of mushy plant matter could be heard hitting the floorboards. Nokri had noticed Aldus had moved and probably dislocated some of the poultice, and angrily chucked some that was on the bed in the boys' general direction before conking out again. She probably wouldn't recall much of it in the morning, but Eliran's tale was an interesting bedtime story, just the kind of gossip she loved.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

Adlus hears some shuflling and something resembling a goggle come from inside the room but then the noises stop, he turns back to Eliran. "Any idea where they might have her? Or how many people they have? "

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

Eliran thought for a bit, "I don't know... But judging by they're search party it wouldn't be too hard to find out." He shook his head, "but before we try a daring rescue we should go find out if they've actually kidnapped her."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"True, but how do we find that out without out alerting them to our presence?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

"Well for the kidnapping we go back to the inn and ask her dad if she's ok... As for their hideout.. we could tail them, or we could try asking around. Taverns and bars tend to be a gold mine of information."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-27*

"hmmm what do you say we check back at the inn tomorrow morning? Think they'll still be looking for us?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-27*

Eliran shrugs, "who knows, depends on how much of an inferiority complex their boss has about his sexual abilities I guess."

Eliran pauses for a second thinking, "You know... I think I remember one of the brutes by the stall mentioning the festival overlook?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-28*

"hmmm now that you mention it, I think he did. You know where that is?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-28*

"Yeah... we could check it out now or tomorrow"  Eliran offered.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-28*

"I think a few hours rest rest at least is in order, I know I'm at least in no condition to fight right now , let's rest up a bit and head there in the morning. See if we can't help this girl."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-28*

"sounds good." Eliran looked out at the festival. "tomorrows gonna be a fun time" he said dryly

Characters" Aldus, Eliran and Nokri
```

The night sleep is restless but Aldus feels somewhat recharged nonetheless. He wakes up a tad earlier than the other two and travels down the hall to the communal washroom to remove the crusty, dried mess that covers the front of him. Just as Nokri’s drunk rambling told him, there is a slight rash forming. But it's better than the bruising that was there before he figures, Even his rib seems to be somehow better. His face looks none the better for now though. Something he’ll have to deal with. He shuffles back down the hall to the find the others awake.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

Nokri is dead to the world, but a slight movement on the bed wakes her up. For several minutes she continues not to move, hoping that her current situation is a nightmare and that when she opens her eyes she'll be back in the one-room apartment in Theanovene. She has no such luck, however. 
Drowsy and slightly hungover, she drags herself upright to search for some water. The canteen she carried around yesterday will work, despite the water within being tepid and gross. "Ugh." She throws herself back on the bed, taking up the entire mattress this time. *Why the [censored] are there clumps of leaves here? That dog is disgusting.*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-30*

Considering his less than ideal bed, it's no surprise Aldus's movement resulted in Eliran jolting awake. Recalling the past nights events, he wasn't sure how to start the day, beyond the fact that he knew that they should check up on the girl before ditching town. As Aldus returned, he groaned out a "good morning"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

"Good morning!" Aldus manages in in a cheery voice. He goes over to his pile of belongings on the desk and puts on his tunic, covering his new stomach rash, which he hope recovers quickly. "Nokri, Eliran and I spoke last ngiht after you laid down, did you happen to hear any of it? I thought I heard you giggling"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

"*What* is that?" Nokri asked, staring at Aldus's new rash. Did he roll around in poison ivy before bed? Gross. "I don't recall anything much after entering the room, and I don't care to hear the details of your late-night love affair."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

"What?! What are you talking about? this?" he says pointing to his torso "This rash that *you* gave me with your weird leaf concoction?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

"Oh, did I?" Certainly, some of the plants Nokri was carrying would do that if not properly prepared. She shrugged. "Magic would've been easier. What a waste of good resources."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

*she knows magic?!* Aldus thinks to himself incredulously "If you dont believe me check your hand" he says noticing  the substance dried to her hands.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

Rolling her eyes, Nokri checked her hand. Sure enough it was crusted in plant material which managed to go unnoticed until now, probably due to her headache. What a gross breach of medical sanitation rules. She scratched the substance off, revealing a reddening rash similar to Aldus's. With a heavy sigh, Nokri grabbed a rather beat up old book from her stuff, flipped to a random page, and started mumbling to herself.

Within seconds her hand was better than new, with no rash or otherwise odd symptoms. She put the book away again. "All better. Thanks for the heads up."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-01-30*

Aldus's mouth falls open as he watches Nokri heel her hand "Any chance you want to help *me* out?" he says pointing to his abdomen.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-30*

"...what? I already did, didn't I?" With her newly healed hand she gestured at the pile of plant goo on the ground. "That shoulda eased some pain, improved your circulation, and bleached your skin a little. I hear skin bleaching is all the rage with nobles. Anyway, is there anything I should know about from your little discussion last night?" she asked, trying to change the subject before he pestered her more.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-30*

Eliran stood up stretching a little, yawning, he responds "We're gonna go check up on a girl that started this mess. If she's ok, we can leave town, if not, we're gonna go help her."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

With a "hmmph" of approval, Nokri stood up and stretched. *So it's this chick's fault we were caught up in that mess? Wonderful. And we're going to go* help *her? Great.* "Lets get a move on then. She in this town?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-01-31*

"You bet, we're gonna go back to the inn you guys were at. Her father's the owner."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-01-31*

`End Aside`

```Location: Inn Daddy's Inn
Characters: Inn Daddy, Inn Daughter, Aldus, Eliran, Nokri```

Eliran let out a sigh of relief when he saw the young girl return. "I'm glad your daughter is safe" He said as he pulled out a small bag of 7 gold coins and put it on the counter, "I'm sorry for yesterday, I hope this can help cover your costs." 
Turning back towards Aldus and Nokri, Eliran gestured towards the door, "Well that's settled. Do you have any thing you want to do in this town before you go? If so, I can show you around." He offered. In all honesty, the young man wanted to join Aldus and Nokri since he also needed to leave town, but he wasn't sure how to breach the topic yet.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

At the site of the woman, Aldus feels a wave of relief wash over him and then a sense of shame he looks down at his feet and then back up to the man and young woman. "Our apologies sir we did not mean too...." he drops off realizing there's nothing he can really say to make up for it.  

As the conversation continues it begins to peak his interest. His ears perk up at the term "Sage" he cocks his head to the side thinking for a minute.  *Where have I heard that before? AH* "I may take you up on that offer Eliran but hold just a second... Nokri, wasn't that man back in Theanovian also a sage?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

Nokri is ready to get out of dodge and leave, especially after the innkeep's empty threats.  She starts to turn and leave now that their business is finished but pauses. "You mean The Great Sage? We did meet him, what a wonderful person. So wise." You never knew who was listening, so it was best to lay on the praise thickly. "What about him?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

"He is some type of noble, yes?" Aldus says slightly sounding confused.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

Nokri shrugged. She had absolutely no idea, but anyone with the title *Great* in their name ought to be... pretty great. Probably.  "He's a very high ranking sorcerer," she spat, making up whatever sounded credible. "Very great. Highly recognized in the eyes of society."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

Eliran looked at the two with slight confusion, "Have... you never heard of a sage before?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Aldus feels his cheek redden a bit "Well, no. Like I mentioned I'm not really from here, I've only been on the mainland a few weeks"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

"Of course I know," Nokri huffed indignantly. Lies.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

"I'm sorry its just... common knowledge on some level?" Eliran explained, not quite paying heed to Nokri's denial _methinks she doth protest to much_ "Sages are some of the most knowledgable and often wise people out there. They are magicians that have made the discoveries that define magic today."

"If you think a magician is impressive, the knowledge and abilities a sage has are almost fantastical. Its a position of great prestige."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Aldus's feeling of embarrassment only increases as Eliran continues his explanation. "Knowledge and discoveries...?" he says more to himself than the other two. *I really should have done more research before leaving home*  he mentally reprimands himself. "A man like that would have alot of books no?" he says lending a sideways glance to Nokri.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

"Most sages have some sort of personal library related to their area of study, though it can result in them being a bit anti-social." Eliran responded, "For example the one on Amnesty street is a notorious shut in."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

"Most likely, but it would depend on the individual sage," she agreed, nodding her head as though this was all common knowledge. After Eliran's comment she hastily threw in a "Many have very elaborate libraries related to their research."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

Eliran looked at Nokri with a raised eyebrow, _she literally just repeats what I'm saying_ he thought to himself.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

Aldus' eyes grow larger as he realizes the mistake he has made. "What is Amnesty Street Sage's magic specialty?" he asks a little louder so that either Eliran and Nokri, or the man and his daughter can answer.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

In response to this Eliran shrugged, "I don't really know, like I said they're a recluse, and I don't actually live in this town."

"Plus, since a sage's status can often be related to his discoveries, they sometimes tend to be very protective of their research." He added

He turned to Nokri, "unless you know of course, you do practice with salves and magic" he asks a little to innocently.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-02*

Up until that point Nokri had been nodding along and agreeing as though this was all very obvious common knowledge. She was slightly taken aback when Eliran directed a question at her. "I can't seem to recall," she stated innocently. "Since the sage here is so introverted, word of them doesn't spread often. I'm sure it'll come back to me but for the moment I've forgotten." She looked around for an out, spotting the innkeeper and his daughter still chatting away. "The locals probably know."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-02*

Eliran silently laughed to himself about Nokri's dodging of the question. "I think we've bothered them enough, it would probably be better to try and visit the Sage directly, especially since he's apparently saving girls on the streets now..."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-02*

"Yea, yea sure, you're right Eliran. I would very much like to see if we can't find this Sage. We can talk more outside." He says before offering an additional appoligy to the inn owner and turning on is heel quickly and pointedly walking out, not waiting for the other two.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

Seeing no reason to stick around further, and not wanting to get into a sage trivia contest where she knew none of the answers, Nokri followed Aldus outside, a bit surprised that he left so quickly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran follows them outside unsure if there might be a problem or...? He just kinda watches.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

Aldus paces around outside the inn weighing his options, his thoughts running around in circles inside his head. He sees Nokri come out of the Inn with the same dejected face shes displayed since they first met a few days ago. He walks up and stops in front of her.  "Why didn't you tell me that man back in Theonevne was a such an expert in magic?! He could have known a spell.... or a potion or... or something! Why would you just let me pass that up?!"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

Shocked at this sudden outburst, Nokri paused. *How was I s’posed to know the old coot was some famous mage?* Looking coldly into Aldus’s eyes she retorted with “him? Please. We already know a way to fix you, it’s in that book somewhere. We didn’t need his help. We’d probably be in debt the rest of our lives if you asked him anyway.” Looking around, she tried changing the subject. “Where are we going now?”

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

Aldus wasnt going to let her off that easy "He could have HAD the book we needed, he could have known an *alternative* he could have been able to give us some direction to go in other then *"oh its in a book somewhere"*  "

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

“And be in debt the rest of your life?” she retorted, leaving out the fact that Aldus would probably owe her forever if she miraculously managed to cure him. “He was in an astronomy tower, what could he have possibly known about obscure healing techniques? Trust me, I’ve been doin’ this my whole life. Just let it go and we can get a move on.”

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

"Have you? really been doing this all your life that is? becuase judging by this" Aldus lifts his shirt to show where his skin has been marred but Nokri 'healling' "That doesnt seem likely to me! What do you really know about healing? 'Ive yet to see you perform any actual healing. Do you really know anything about this book? or are you just making stuff up?!"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

Patience running thinner by the second, Nokri huffed. "Pardon? Your broken rib cage feels better, does it not? I'm sure next time your bones snap you'll enjoy sleeping without any local anesthetic. You try doing better, drunk and with a concussion." Stamping her foot, she continued, "Why would I make up a fake book? To travel with some smelly mutt and have a fun little adventure dragging us to the middle of [*several censored words*] nowhere? It's thanks to the kindness of my heart you have a chance at all of being cured, so be a little grateful. You want to backtrack and speak to some old codger? Go right on ahead."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

"Be a little grateful? Be a little grateful? Funny, I distinctly remember saving your life on two seperate occasions. You realise I could have just left you to die right?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Hearing this Eliran feels the need to step in, "hey hey _hey_"he starts, moving to stand between them, "let's take a deep breath here." He looks nervously behind him, not wanting to cause another scene at the inn.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

The interference of Eliran makes him consider his surroundings for a second, nonetheless he continuee to glare at Nokri. "She's been making up shit since the moment I met her, I never know if what she says is truth or bullshit!"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

"You think I'd die that easily? Please. I never needed your help. Trust me, I have faced *far* worse situations than a little bump on the head." She turned to Eliran, "Why don't *you* take a deep breath? We're having a conversation here. Or make yourself useful for once and map out where we're supposed to be going." Back to Aldus, she scowled. "I only ever lie when it's needed. To save our skin.  What, is making happy friends with everybody the key to harmony? Is that gonna get us out of trouble, huh?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

"You were knocked out! You could have been dead within minutes! And *dont even start* with that only when it's needed, you have no reason to lie to me and yet you've answered every even somewhat perosnal question with obvious lies, meanwhile I've told you everything you've asked about me!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran is taken aback, _how dare_ he thought to himself. 
Taking a breath he starts, "ok _pipsqueak_ we'll get moving as soon as you shut your racist,  lying mouth." He said with a strained smile. "Stop pretending to be a cocky know it all and maybe people would be willing to pay for your quack treatments."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

"Oh please, like I haven't been unconscious before. What have I ever asked you? Your medical history? Unlike *some* people I don't go digging in other people's business. But maybe that's just what you dogs do, dig."
Eliran steps up to bat. "*Excuse me?* I had no shortage of customers in Theanovene. Even he can attest to that," she motioned towards Aldus, recalling he had to wait in line when they first met. Which was a rarity but they didn't need to know that right now. "Maybe you should shut your mouth and learn to mind your own business instead of dragging everybody down with you."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

"A healer that can't tell the difference between a sage and a pupil having a lot of customers in Theanovene?" Eliran scoffed, "I bet your customers were poor saps that didn't know better, otherwise why would you suddenly up and leave on a trip for _one_ person."  Eliran shook his head, "ya know what I don't even know why I'm trying," he turned to Aldus, "you shouldn't have to put up with this. I know people who could easily find a healer at least as good as she is, and they wouldn't call you a mutt or anything."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

"It's called trying to get to know someone, maybe become friends. Maybe you should try it sometime, perhaps opening up to someone would make you less of a heartless grouch." he then turns his attention to Eliran trying to even his tone "Wait really? But you dont even know what I'm really looking for, do you know that Sage on Anmesty for real? do you thinkg he could help"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

"I don't know what ails you, in Theanovene alone I could find you sevetal better healers, and I have connections with nobles in Callora that could connect you with at least one sage."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

"I got driven out because of a scene that *this* guy helped cause. If my customers didn't start attacking some soldiers there's no way would I be here now." Nokri scoffed, "yeah right. Some sage will offer you help. Maybe he can help you both with whatever brain issues you've got."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran ignores her, "let's start with the sage on amnesty, I don't know him, but if he's helping people on the street I'm sure he could offer some insight without any real cost."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

"helped cause? helped end more like...." He trails off, "Yea.... yea sure, thanks Eliran"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-02-05*

Eliran looks back at Nokri, "feel free to come along if you want" he says, not wanting to completely abandon the small girl. 
He pats Aldus's shoulder, "come on, Amnesty Street is this way" he says leading the wolf boy.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-02-05*

Nokri grunted, her blood still boiling. She wanted nothing to do with them, but didn't exactly have anywhere else to go in a strange city. With her looks, people would be cautious dealing with her alone and suspect a Drecan spy. She reluctantly decided to stick with them, but followed several paces behind so as to maintain distance.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-02-05*

```Location: The Street/Alley way of a broken town
Characters: Desi, Aldus, Eliran, Nokri```

Eliran waited, still standing relatively low and in a nonthreatening way to try and calm desi a little. The ball was in her court, and he didn't want a fight her, especially since he still wanted to thank her for dealing with the problems in Hylley. He watched the girl closely, wondering what her response would be.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

"More nonsense," Nokri huffed. "I was there when they met the sage, they promised to take you there at all costs for their own benefit," she said to Desii.

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Desii looks between the two of you. "Whatever internal problems you're having, can't you just leave me alone? Whatever Zaimar told you isn't true and I just want to be done with him."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

“You’ve every right to do that. I had no intention of helping them take you. I disagree with these ruffians, doing whatever they please with little consideration for others.”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

Eliran thought for a moment, and then decided to sit down with his legs crossed, "so what is the truth then?" He asked, "from what we were told by Zaimar, you are a talented, but clumsy mage that stole his books, and he just wants you to return safely with them." 

Eliran paused looking at her more closely, "but with how you're reacting, I'd say he isn't the kindly old man who's just  worried about his apprentice..."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

"Desi please don't listen to her! While its true we agreed to help Zaimar, I don't know much about the man. I simply stumbled upon him and it seemed he may have the answers I need. He sent me after you - because apparently you have the book and so you posses the answers now." Aldus says slightly frantically "If he's not the man he appears to be, if he hurt you or anything like that I would not keep my word to him, he''s not a man worth keeping my word for in that case. I am not loyal to him, I'm simply looking for answers. I just need to know - do you have a book with a possible solution for a Laguz who cannot transform?"

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Desii's outstretched hand leans towards Nokri as Eliran sits down. The sitting minstrel is apparently less of a threat. 

"What book has he told you about? It's the only thing that seems consistent in your story."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-14*

They seem to be luring the girl in. Ugh. Nokri grudgingly lowered her raised vial, clutching it tight enough that her knuckles were white.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

"It was a book of potions..." Eliran tried to remember if the sage had mentioned the name of the author or title, "he didn't tell us a specific name, but he mentioned the author specialized in potions that heal the mind... and that the author earned a lot of scorn for it."

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Desii's mouth opens slowly at your description. She seems to be piecing quite a few things together in her mind.

"Why did he say he wanted this book...?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

"Well for one when we met he said he was working on a potion from it, but beyond that all he said was that it had the potion my friend here needs" Eliran gestured towards Aldus, "to cure his inability to transform."

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Desii looks at Eliran's face for a long time. 

"And did he say why I took this book? Why I left?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

"He... he said he just assumed you were going through a young, rebellious stage, I admittedly didn't think much of that. It made sense to me then"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

"Now that you mention it, he mostly avoided specifics outside what he wanted back, and what we needed to know to find you..." Eliran thought for a second, returning Desi's gaze, "it didn't bother me much, because I was coming this way anyways and finding somebody en route seemed harmless..."

He paused again, "why did you run?" He asked after a moment.

**Bill** - *2018-03-14*

Desii shuffles one foot a bit, and her eyes flick down for a moment. You can see her clench the spine of her tome harder.

"What interest to you have? Why should this matter to you?" she asks.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-14*

*what interest do i have?!* Aldus keeps his composure - or whatever is left of it at this point, but in reality he wants to scream. "Desi you don't know me, so I obviously don't expect you to know the answer to that, but the answers in that book hold -or may hold - are like breathing or water. If there is any chance that something in that book can make me become who I truly am, I must know. I have little interest in returning the book for money or reward. If you yourself could help me even, it would mean the world - no, more than the world to me. Please, just hear me out" he offers a sad smile as the hope he felt earlier flees his body.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-14*

"I was asked to help a young lady get home, and help a man retrieve his stolen property, both of which sound like the right thing to do. and in return, I was offered a chance for my friend to be cured." Eliran shrugged, continuing, "from my perspective, either I'm helping somebody get home, or I'm catching a thief."

He looked at her, "but now I find out the man I'm helping has his apprentice terrified, and he wasn't quite forthcoming on the nature of what we're getting back." He crossed his arms, "So I want to know, why did you run and steal that book. If Zaimar is actually hurting his apprentices, or doing something wrong with that book, I want to know."

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Desii's expression becomes sympathetic as Aldus proclaims his need. The girl seems caught up in empathy for Aldus's desperation, and you can see her outstretched arm waver. Eliran makes his piece and Desii seems to have mixed feelings; not liking Eliran's description of how it started but accepting it was a first impression as he shares his current thoughts. She ends up looking between the the two young men, her thoughts racing a mile a minute.

`[End Aside]`

```Location: Crow's Kilt
Characters: Desii, Nokri, Eliran, Aldus, Dain```

Desii settled into her chair, almost sinking into it. She had taken her satchel off her back and stowed her tome inside before resting it on her lap. She seems content to start at the ceiling for a moment, before looking at Nokri as the shorter girl sat down. Desii frowns in confusion and she blinks in curiosity. 

"Right... Um, I wanted to ask one thing before we get into everything... I suppose it could be called part of the introductions, if you'd like..." she trails off, twisting a strand of her hair before awkwardly looking between Nokri and her allies.

"What was up with that act about your friends being abusive ex's, and trying to manipulate you and everyone else, all that? I thought about it on the way here, I have no idea how that could have boiled down to a plan where you could do what Zaimar asked."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-22*

Aldus takes a seat across from Nokri. He feels anxious at the questions but it's obviously something she'd want to know "Yes I would like to know the same thing" He folds his arms and leans back in his chair glaring at Nokri with his deep emeralds, Nokri's accusations still ringing in his ears.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-22*

"you know... I would love  to know the answer to that myself, " Eliran said with a clear hint of annoyance, "How about it Nokri, why don't you tell us what you were planning."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

"Exactly this. Don't you see how they treat me?" Nokri rebutted, trapped into a corner. She had reluctantly followed them in hopes of Desii opening up, but now that they were there it obviously wasn't going to happen. "If you want to believe these scoundrels, go right ahead. I'm not sticking with them a moment longer." Face red, she turned to leave.

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

"Oh no no, don't go! I didn't mean to offend or anything of the sort! I simply wanted to know what your plan was, since I couldn't figure it out myself!" Desii says, halfway standing.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-22*

Aldus eyes go wide and he has to stop himself from reaching out to stop her"Nokri wait! You know what you said was a lie, why are you being like this? We could have just approached Desii and spoke rationally"

"I suppose we didn't have much of a plan. The plan was "find Desii, bring her back to Zaimar, and get my cure" Nokri however obviously wasn't fond of that plan. Rest assured that is no longer the plan, we wont be attempting to bring you back any longer"

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Desii slips back into her chair. "So... what was the point of the, I guess good guard bad guard routine?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-22*

"I have no idea," Eliran started, looking at Nokri, "If I were to guess, she was just trying to start another lie and weasel some sort of profit at our expense, and we just wanted to talk." 
Eliran turned to Aldus, "I don't know why you trusted her after what happened in Hylley."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

Several tables away, Nokri paused. She shot a glare at them, weighing her options. Despite how sick of all the negative attention she was, they were talking about a juicy subject that she had an interest in. She angrily grumbled a "what, are you gonna beg me to stay?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-22*

Aldus doesnt regard Eliran's comment, despite the point he make. Arms still folded Aldus doesn't turn toward Nokri  while responding "Hmmf, you'd like that wouldn't you? If you want to go then go, I'm not going to try to stop you again. We could have been friends but it appears your cold-heartedness  goes deeper than I thought"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

Nokri opened her mouth to argue some more, but it wouldn't be worth it. She didn't want to cause yet another scene in a public area. She originally was heading towards the door, but instead changed her course and marched up to Dain. "What drinks do you serve?" she asked politely, yet her irritation at the situation was clear. She hoped a nice alcoholic beverage could soothe that, and maybe give her a reason to sit around and eavesdrop.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-22*

Eliran noticed Nokri's walk up to the bar and sighed, "hey desi... can we bother you with something?" he pointed at Nokri, "if she gets alcohol somebody probably will have to take care of her, and it'd probably be better if you hosted her rather than us."

Eliran then lifted his hand and stage whispered so nokri could hear, "Just don't except any concoctions she makes while drunk, it left Aldus with a nasty rash once"

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Desii looks between Aldus and Nokri, eyes wide. The apparently bitterness between them seems to confuse her further. 

"I'm sorry if I pried too much or... Just.. Alright?" she says, putting her hands up as if she was trying to make herself appear unthreatening.

Dain looks at the girl and gives her an odd look. Not one directed at Nokri, no, something wistful and lost elsewhere. He smiles lightly at her. 

"Callorian brews from three of the neighboring kingdoms, and we even have a cask of Eraian White. I'm sorry I don't have anything from the south, it's been... difficult to trade up here." he says.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-22*

Aldus is incredulous of Noki's gall regarding this entire situation. For a moment he's at a lose for words. "She hasn't even had one drink yet, I don't think a babysitter is necessary just yet"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-22*

"yeah but if she gets the strongest drink like she did back in Hylley you know she'll be gone in minutes."

Eliran looked back to desi, "So if she gets too drunk can you take care of her...?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-22*

Aldus shrugs, obviously tired of the whole thing at this point. "So we'll hang out here for a bit, we have alot to go over anyway"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

"What's that supposed to mean?" The southern comment ticked her off in her sensitive state and the harsh words came out naturally. "I-I mean, Eraian White. I've never heard of that before." It would be a bad idea to anger to innkeeper and Nokri tried to control her tone. "Sounds interesting, how much is it?"

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Desii looks to Eliran and is clearly uncomfortable with the idea yet has no idea how to express it. 

If Dain was offended by Nokri's tone, it didn't show. He continues to smile as he explains. "Simply that it might be nice to have a taste of home, being so far away. I can't imagine you aren't some what homesick." He turns around, pouring a white gold liquid into a beer glass. "Eraian White is a speciality from our occasionally friendly neighbor. Most places in Callora can't get it, but our border status gives us a few benefits, to go with the additional troubles."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-22*

"you don't have too if you don't want to, I just thought it'd be better to leave a drunk girl under another girls care instead of two guys she accused of being abusive" Eliran shrugged, "I don't like her but I wouldn't just ditch somebody who needs help."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

The liquid courage seemed expensive, with its pale rich color. But Nokri wasn't going to waste what was already being poured. "Where do I look like I come from?" Nokri asked. The answer was obvious, no matter how she tried to hide or deny it, but it surprised her how frank people were and how quickly they jumped to assumptions. All their assumptions were correct, but *what if*?
Her ear twitched as she picked up what Eliran said about getting drunk. "This looks delightful, thank you," she said to Dain. "I can hold my liquor just fine and this looks exquisite," passive aggressive emphasis on *just fine*.

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

"I have no doubt you can." Dain says. "It'll just be 2 silver." he says.

"I um... Really, you don't know me from a bandit down the block, honestly..." Desii says.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-03-22*

"No, but I know a certain innkeepers daughter that you saved from a gang, and I'll trust her word." Eliran leaned back in his seat, "thank you for that by the way."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-03-22*

"you seem to have a reputation of doing good, I have no reason not to trust you right now. Aside from that you may be my only hope..."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-03-22*

After a split second of hesitation, Nokri dropped the coins on the counter. *A special treat. I deserve it,* was her justification.

**Bill** - *2018-03-22*

Dain takes the coins and thanks you. He returns to washing glasses, as there's no one but your group in the bar. 

Desii gives Eliran yet another odd look. "Um, sure." She looks between the minstrel and now the laguz, trying to figure out how she became someone's only hope. "I uh. Anyway. You wanted to know about Danthres."

`[End Aside]`

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-01*

```Location: Crow's Kilt
Characters: Desii, Eliran, Aldus```

As he watched the couple exit the inn, Eliran looked at the bar and noticed the lack of a certain  girl with straw blonde hair in twin braids.  Looking towards Aldus, he wondered if the laguz had noticed her disappearance as well. _I doubt its her..._ he thought to himself, figuring the girl always tended to have some sort of concoction to defend herself available. 
As Desi stood and started preparing to leave he looked at Aldus, "I think we know a straw blonde hair girl..." He said to nobody in particular, "She'll probably be fine though, with her mouth."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-01*

"I don't know... seems to be too perfect timing for my liking. We haven't been here that long, seems like an unlikely coincidence that as soon as she is out of our sight a girl matching her description is kidnapped? Her mouth would get her into *more* trouble rather than less..." Aldus takes a moment to think. "Weather it's Nokri that has been taken or not, I still feel compelled to help" then he says quieter under his breath "even more so if it *isnt* Nokri"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-01*

"I doubt it isn't her, there's shouldn't be anybody else here that looks  remotely drecan." Eliran sighed, "Still, can we take the risk of tracking down bandits? Your potions ingredients are from all over the continent." he pointed out,  and then added, "Even worse, if we cause trouble with Eraia on the border now, we won't be able to cross and find the innkeepers daughter. We definitely will be on their wanted list."

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

Desii looks up from her packed sling. 

"You think this is your... acquaintance? The hairstyle matches, but it's not unheard of for a girl to have braids in her hair." Desii says. "Those ingredients will continue to be there, while hard to get they aren't in high demand. Causing trouble with Eraia..."

"Well, that would be bad, but we're already talking about sneaking across the border so let's just get started early?" Desii says with the air of a joke, but she knows it's a bad one.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-01*

Eliran looks at her, "We don't need to sneak in. I've crossed the border plenty of times as a courier." He pulls some paperwork out of his bag, "With this I can get into the country with a 2 or 3 people as 'body guards'."

"look, if we cause problems here and get caught, theres no way to get to the other side and find them." Eliran explained, "But if we get to the other side, we can start helping people sneak back a lot easier. They're looking for people trying to sneak into the country, not out."

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

Desii sighs and smiles. "Well that's wonderful, I had no idea how to go about crossing. I was going to ask Dain and Saila, but we got rather side tracked... Oh wait!" Desii taps her fist into her palm.

"The white cloak! The guard said that the pyromancer with the bandits the night before last was wearing a white cloak!" Desii looks between the two of you with a glimmer in her eyes. 

"There a fair possibility that it's not an Eraian who took her, it's actually the bandit tribe from the other night!"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-01*

"I'm not exactly a *fan* of Nokri, especially right now but if we can find where she was taken, is is possibility these are the same people that took Dain and Salia'a daughter? And even if not.... theres still the chance that its not Nokri at all but someone completely innocent." Aldus's eyes dart around the room as if his visualizing all the various possibly outcomes of the situation.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-01*

Eliran frowned, "I thought the 'bandits' were supposed to be Eraians in disguise to kidnap people..." He was wavering, clearly not sure. "If we do this, and they're Eraian, we absolutely can't get caught."

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

"The same person who took Enera?" Desii sits back down and leans into the chair back. "As idea as that would be for the Kelits, I don't think it's the case." 

"The story the Kelit's has makes the most sense when Eraia was after Enera for her magical talents. If your friend is magically talented that's one thing, but no one could know that since she just arrived here."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-01*

"Ay, but she's drecan. And Eraia is in a holy war against Dreca." Eliran's tone darkened, "And they enjoy forceful conversions."

**Bill** - *2018-04-01*

"That assumes your friend, who just arrived in town, was noticed by an Eraian spy and that spy was able to get message to someone who can do the kidnapping in the time we've been together. I find that hard to believe." Desii says with a frown.

"Maybe I just want it to be someone different. It bodes better for Enera if that was a unique case." Desii smiles sadly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-01*

Eliran returns her sad smile, "It would..." he sighed, "I think its more likely an Eraian spy kidnapped her upon contact though, If they wanted somebody from this village, they would have just taken them during the so called 'bandit' raid... It just doesn't make sense for a bandit to kidnap somebody in the middle of the day to begin with. there's no reward or benefit."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

"While I don't exactly like the idea of risking my skin for Nokri in particular, what these bandits - be them Erain or not - are doing is not right. The principle of the matter is that they not only pillaged this town, but kidnapped a girl likely based on race alone... how long until someone else is taken? Or they pillage the town again, or another town? There's just too many factors here for me to be comfortable ignoring the problem and carrying on my way. Perhaps we could get the town watch involved?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

Eliran sighed, "you're right... still" Then a light bulb went off in Eliran's head, "Hey Aldus, do you still have your mask?" he asks suddenly

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

"yes...?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

"do you think you can fight with it on?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

"I believe so... It shouldn't be a problem. That would be a good way to try and keep our identities a secret"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

Eliran gave a silly grin, "exactly." He said, they would still have to be careful, but the idea of masked heroes beating bandits is like something from stories or songs! If anything, he could turn this adventure into a new piece, telling of the fox and the wolf, one cunning and the other strong, that saved townspeople from evil. He turned to Desii, "What about you, think you could work with a mask? even if Nokri went missing, most of her stuff was left here, so if she still had her mask you could borrow it?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

"I'm... well, terribly confused. What's the point of the masks?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

"Eliran is concerned that if the bandits end up being Eraian that we will have trouble getting into the country after our little side trip."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

"And if we have face masks, we can hide our identities." Eliran continued Aldus's explanation, then added,  "Another bonus is that animal masks can also help with intimidation"

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

"Eraians razing a town is grounds for war. I don't think they do that on a whim." Desii says with conviction. "Masks are for festivals, not for he battlefield." She states. She doesn't argue the point further. 

"You're going to go after the bandits yourselves then?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

"I mean I dont think we should run in there firing arrows, maybe we could try a more stealthy approach? Is there anyone we could maybe rally for help?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

"The guard are injured from the raid... I don't know the town much better than you honestly. We'd best catch up to Dain for that kind of information."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

"I doubt we can ask for much help, this town barely survived the last attack from the looks of it, to get them together for dealing with a bandit camp?" Eliran shook his head, "Aldus is right, stealth is the best way to go. A small group, scout it out, then contact the local king if possible."

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

"I have... little fighting experience. I can hold my own via spellcraft, but maybe it's best you adventurous types lead the way..." Desii says. She doesn't seem to like admitting she can't handle the task at hand.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

Aldus brings a hand to his chin and makes a dissatisfied face. "Id hardly call myself the 'Adventurer type' but it would seem Eliran and I are the closest thing we have, unless we can recruit a few others but We'll have to see about that"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

"Adventure type _is_ a bit of a stretch for us" Eliran said as he scratched the back of his head, "I'm a bard and specialize in archery....Still, we can do our best, if anything a tracker would be helpful. We don't want our group getting much larger than 4 or 5."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

"good point" Aldus's confidence in this plan is wavering by the moment "I dont like this... but I cant just sit idly by"

**Bill** - *2018-04-02*

"Right. Sitting and discussing it won't help us figure anything out. We're all not the best equipped for this, but we're united in that we can't let this slide." Desii says, standing again and nodding to the group.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-02*

Eliran gets up and shoulders his bow,"Lets go then and see if Dain can offer us any final help before we go."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-02*

Aldus shakes his head in agreement and turns to the door "shall we?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-10*

'''End aside'''

```Location: Town center
Characters: Desii, Eliran, Aldus, Frin, Saila and Dain,```

Eliran nodded understanding the town leaders struggle, "I figured as much, still," He scratched the back of his head, "we aren't particularly familiar with the local area..." he asked, "Would it be possible to get the help of one or two people?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Frin looks to Eliran with a raised eyebrow. "I wish we had the people to spare you, I do. But look around you. This is out entire town guard. Everyone else in town isn't a fighter. You've unfortunately come at the lowest this town has ever been."

"If there was anyone able to fight who could go with you, I'd suggest it. There's truly no one." Frin says sadly. "I can't rightly send anyone else with you, one of our resident hunters, given where you'll end up. We've... lost enough life this week."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-10*

Eliran looked conflicted, he knew that sending anybody with them was dangerous and hard for the town leader, however without a local, he doubted they could figure out where the bandits were without getting caught themselves. "I understand your position but..." he looked somewhat distraught, "our friend is drecan, and time is of the essence." 
His hands were moving as if to explain, giving off a clear sign of anxiety, "We don't need somebody to fight, _We_ didn't even plan on fighting. " He looked back to Aldus, then towards Frin again, "Somebody needs to scout the bandits if the reinforcements are going to avoid casualties, and it'll help you save those kidnapped during the attack." He looked almost pleading, "We can do that for you, we can help for the attack too, Please if you know anybody who could help, couldn't  you at least ask?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

Aldus scratches his chin and looks to Dain. "I realize I don't really have the right to ask this but... Dain, would you be willing to help us? Or if you  know anyone who might be capable?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Frin frowns. "You just heard me say to Dain and Saila how stretched thin we are. I can't rightly asks these men to pick up their wounded bodies to tour you around the plains can I?" her frustration is returning. "They bandits retreated towards the desert, not many places to hide on that route. I think everyone's agreed they're at the foot of the mountains."

Dain looks to contemplate it for a moment. He eventually comes to a sigh. "I... wish I could. I'm only a innkeeper. My place in neither in the wilds nor on the battlefield. I won't die before I find my daughter." He looks down. "I wish I could do more to help you."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

"Then perhaps you could provide a horse or two at the least? So we can get to them faster?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Dain looks to Frin and stares at the older woman. "No one will be riding anytime soon. It's about the only thing we can provide."

Frin's hand raises to make a point, but she doesn't say anything. She nods back to Dain, and then to the two of you. "Our Guardsman stables are by the north entrance. Tell them I sent you."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-04-10*

_Ah yes Everyone's agreed that the bandits they didn't track clearly fled to the foot of the mountains, and because the mountain ranges are small and nobody would think to hide in them, going to hunt for them there would TOTALLY be simple_ Eliran thought to himself. tracking down these bandits was a foolhardy task at this rate. _I bet even if we did go looking for them, the reinforcements coming tomorrow would get to the bandits first._
"If not somebody to help us find them, do you have any maps we could use?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

"Certainly, we have some covering the area up to the mountains in my office. It's only a few blocks, you won't be able to miss it." Frin says. "Take them if they'll help."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

"Is there anything else you might be able to give us? Anything to look out for or, anything that might help us at all?"

**Bill** - *2018-04-10*

Dain and Frin look to each other and shake their heads. "We're not exactly in positions to leave town all that much." Dain says sheepishly.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-04-10*

"Well, if thats it...." Aldus feel discouraged to say the least. He isnt even sure trying to find Nokri is something he wants to do, but he knows its the right thing to do

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

```Characters: Aldus, Desii, Eliran, Nokri
Location: Yes```

As they ride away into the Great Beyond, Nokri flips off the straggling pursuers with both hands, and nearly falls off her horse in the process. She pretends no one saw that and imagines all members of their party looking incredibly majestic and heroic as they speed off, despite Nokri herself being covered in grime falling apart at the seams.

As they ride in silence and catch their breath, Nokri feels uncomfortable and awkward. Hoping to break this tension she tentatively asks "where are we heading?"

**Bill** - *2018-05-18*

Desii breaks her staring contest with the back of her horse's head with a final sigh. Her heart is still pounding, but her breath has evened out and she can feel her muscles relaxing. 

"Before that, are you okay? Injuries? I can do first aid, but I'm, um" she gulps and flicks her eyes behind her, "Not sure if we should stop that long."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

Aldus feels nervous when he feels both of Nokris hands leave him at the same time *did she fall off? She's so small maybe I didnt hear-* he turns his head, tucking his hair behind his lower ear to get a look behind him and sees shes just flipping off the bandit hideout. "my sentiments exactly" he mutters, but keeps both hands firmly on the reigns. 

"We are headed back to town for now, too check to see if those reinforcements have arrived, and to get you - and all of us- some rest, if we can avoid stopping until we are back, I'd perfer it but" he hesitates " h-how do you feel?" he asks gently

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-05-18*

"I can heal my own injuries. I'm quite fine," she muttered, not offensively yet just salvaging what little pride she had left. Rolling her head to test how sore her neck truly was, she concluded it was indeed pretty sore. Now that she thought about it, Nokri was sore all over and the swaying of the horse certainly didn't help. Some lacerations where she was dragged along the ground and a nice motley of bruises all over made her look very scrappy, but they would heal. *It'd be nice if I had my book.*
"...and you?" she asked the group. N-not because she was concerned or anything. It'd just be easier to get medical supplies in bulk and treat everything at once. Yeah.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-18*

The question for his concern make him widen his eyes a bit but before responding to her *first ever* question of concern for others he says "That burn on your neck says you are decidedly not 'quite fine' - and is that bit of shaking I feel behind me? hmmm... but if you insist" he shrugs a little and surveys the scenery ahead of his black horse.  "I'm still shaky from the whole ordeal" he hold his hand out to testify for this, an involuntary twitching can be seen as a left over effect of adrenaline.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-19*

Eliran looked at Nokri from his horse and shook his head, "If your fine then this horse is actually my uncle." he quipped, noting the girl's clearly bruised and beaten state. He looked back behind the group, checking if any Bandits had somehow gotten on horses themselves and tracked the group. "We should be in the clear for a little while..." He looked over to Desii, calling loudly, "Hey how long would it take to patch her up?"

**Bill** - *2018-05-21*

"I... haven't at a look at her yet, but first aid shouldn't be too long! 15 minutes at most?" Desii calls.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-21*

Eliran thought a solid second, considered it, and decided. "Ok then we lets stop for some quick first aid, we've got more than a large enough lead."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-23*

Characters: Aldus (Personal Aside)

Aldus walks into the copse of trees a little ways and and lifts himself onto a low hanging branch of a sturdy, old oak. Propping his back against its trunk He removes a leather bound notebook from his side bag and unties its bindings. He isn't far from the group, through the other trees he can see Eliran, Nokri and Desii so he can continue to keep and eye -and ear- on them. He pulls quill and ink from his bag then, props the book in his lap, holds the ink bottle between his knees, and begins to write in neat Naissankarian:


>>>>>>>
I do indeed believe I have quite the tolerance for people, at times I’ll admit I have far too much tolerance. It seems to be that even when people would see me battered and broken and thirsting for water I would still defend them, even against my better judgement. Today I was foolish, impulsive. I risked my life for someone who has given no regard to mine in all the time I have known her. And why? Because of some instinctual need to protect that I have only felt for few others up until this day. Is it because I am so far from my home? From the people I care about? My mother, and my friends, Master Van Horning and even Layda, though I am sure she would surely scoff to see me even forming the letters to her name in this notebook. Did my instincts use this one girl - this woman, as no more than a surrogate for a pack bond? She has done nothing to elicit this sort of a response from me. Nothing! Her treatment of me makes me feel like the lowest of the low, like few others have in the past, like my father has. 

But unlike my father, she falters in her apparent distaste for me. When he crossed that line, that line where I was no longer his son, he never came back. he never once gave me another hug or shed another tear for me. When I left, he all but said 'good riddance’ at my back when I turned away.

The other day she outrightly accused me of being what might as well be considered the scum of this world. Lies of course, she is quite versed in them. Her comparison reminded me much of my aforementioned father, yet her treatment of me only makes me me want to compare *her* to him, not myself.  

But then not even one full day later I find myself bruised and bloodied -and wasting good poison arrows mind you- to save her from people who may just be even worse than people like my father. And it was stupid, so stupid but when I managed to save her from being hung on the spot, she hugged me. She *hugged* me. She cried at the sight of me and said my name so desperately that the only underlying meaning must have been a thank you. I thought maybe this was a turning point, and maybe it still is but right now she does not seem thankful. She seems to be the same cold and selfish person she has been since I've met her. But when she looked at me, when I saved her, there was something there in her eyes I could swear it. Something warm and not icy like this outward appearance she lets out. I wish she’d let me in, let us all in, especially after today. 

Perhaps I am wrong, perhaps she *is* cold and heartless ~~and perhaps I should have let her hang from that rope.~~ I find myself severely conflicted, I wish to discuss this with someone, but I have only just meet the mage, and Eliran may think I am mad for even considering such things. I wish to become closer with them, they are good people and not frustrating like the small blonde woman which I have already wasted too many words on. 
<<<<<<<

He snaps his journal shut and stretches his neck muscles which have become tight from sitting in this strange position. He rebinds his notebook and puts at as well as his writing supplies away. Then he leaps down from the branch, pulling his unpigmented hair to one side of his head to run his hands through it in stress. Looking again at the sky he suddenly remembers his pre-battle thoughts “Well, at least we are alive.”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

```Characters: Eliran, Aldus
Location: A street in town```
After meeting with Frin upon entering the town, Eliran prompts Aldus to follow him, leaving Nokri and Desii behind with some generic excuse about taking care of some sort of thing. After he gets a fair distance from the two, he glance back to the laguz following him, "So..... you doing alright?" He asked casually.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

Aldus raises an eyebrow at Elirans request, non-specific as it is he follows him. Eliran's question for his welfare catches off gaurd. He pauses shortly stumbling over his words a bit. "Ah yes, I mean at least I will be. I assume you are reffering to my little outburst earlier. I appoligize, I've had quite the day but I shouldn't have gone off like that in front of you... That woman is simply so.... frustrating."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

"Its not something you need to apologize for," Eliran said waving a hand, "people get stressed,  and Nokri is definitely a frustrating type."

"But, if it were that simple you wouldn't have gone off in the woods for so long," Eliran said as he stopped walking and looked Aldus in the eye. He then mulls over it a bit "well I mean you could have wankin it I guess.... but I doubt that"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

Aldus's eye widen at Eliran's statement, he lifts a hand to his mouth to stiffle a laugh, which helps to lift some residual weight from the day off his shoulders. "No, most definitely not. I suppose I needed a few moments to... reflect on what happened earlier. My instincts took over in a way I haven't.... encountered in while, and it took a lot out of me. I don't wish to burden you with the details."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

"Hey man, if you let a lot out, I'm impressed not burdened," Eliran said with a slight gesture and a smirk. 
He then let out a small sigh before he scratched the back of his head looking down. _Another jerk joke, come on serious time Eli serious time_
"But seriously," he asked looking up to Aldus with some concern, "Are you sure about that?" he asked, "Keeping it to yourself isn't going to help it go away, especially if she's still traveling with us."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

The awkwardness in the air is almost palpable at this point but Aldus it thankful for the concern Eliran has for him. He takes a breath and attempts to explain. "Well, Nokri isn't a very nice person, obviously, but we all put our lives on the line for her anyway. As if that wasn't enough, when it came down to it, my pack instinct kicked in. Now, I don't know if you know what that it but it's pretty self explanatory I guess. I had to save her, in that moment I was running on impulse. I didn't even realize what I was doing until the entire ordeal was over and then she has the gall to not even thank us? And criticize Desii as well? I don't regret saving her I just.... Don't know if she'll ever appreciate anything anyone does for her." Also let's out a deep sigh and chuckles nervously "I'm rambling"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

Eliran looked at Aldus and just kinda nodded, thinking about it. "So... nokri is a part of your pack.. and you're worried cause she seems to still be a complete jerk?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

Aldus scratches the back of his head contemplating. "Yes? I don't think she nessicarly 'deserves' my kindness,that sounds bad - I mean that's not to say I would have deserted her. I uh... have been prone to letting people treat me poorly in the past, I don't wish to continue that trend in my life but it appears the ancestors have different plans for me. I don't want to be taken advantage of" Aldus groans slightly "You must think I'm a fool."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

"I don't think you're a fool" Eliran said quickly, maybe a bit too quickly, "I mean maybe a bit naive at time but..." he shook his head, "You've been treated poorly before and now you find yourself having family ish feelings for somebody who treats you poorly." Eliran struggled for words, "Sure it ...sounds foolish i mean but...." He paused, thinking for a moment. Then choosing his words careful he added, "just because you feel for somebody who's horrible to you doesn't make you a fool. It can be foolish but you aren't a fool"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

"Hmm I suppose you are correct. Still I do wish Nokri would open up. Do you believe there is good in her? Somewhere? Or do you think she is a lost cause?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

"Honestly? who knows" Eliran responded with a shrug, "But we might as well give her a shot. She must have PTSD for days after being beaten and strung up for a hanging. You really can't not feel bad for her." he said sincerely, "Before the kidnapping I would have left her in this town alone but now?" He shook his head. "it'd be cruel."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

"Perhaps I should try speaking with her? But that has failed so many times before, I don't know. I'm sure she is very much shaken from the whole thing."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-05-28*

"Maybe..? I think we should give her some time. We do have a ways to trisp to catch up during" Eliran offered.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-05-28*

"Yes you are probably right. Hopefully the right time will present itself"

```CHaracters: Afina, Desii, Eliran
Location: Outside the Abbey```

Eliran was peacefully waiting when he hears a very rude voice interject and ram into him out of nowhere. Not one to take such things lying down, he quickly grabbed the rude maidens shoulder, "Pardon Miss," He started, before noticing the girl was a mage, clearly ready to fight. _Jesus christ why is it all female mages want to shoot me with something these days_ He thought to himself, as he quickly grabbed the girls free hand, pointing it very specifically not in his direction, and promptly knocked her tome hand out of the way with his other hand. "Woh there miss why the sudden need to fi- wait a minute..." He bent over slightly to look her in the eye, "My god is this an Afrin of the Tyndalls I spy?" He asked incredulously, "What are _you_ doing here?"  the surprise was clear in his voice.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

Afina yelped as her free hand was grabbed by the wrist, and her other promptly dropped her tomes. “Hey, what are you--” the princess started, before she found herself eye to eye with a certain charismatic merchant from her childhood. A confused look flickered across her face, before lighting up as she realized who it was that she had bumped into. “Eliran!?” she exclaimed incredulously, throwing her arms around the tall man. She pressed her cheek to his chest and closed her eyes, much like she had done as a child. “Eliran, what are you doing here? What brought you to Trisp? Are you well? What have you been doing,-- I mean, why didn’t you write-- I was just in Theanovene and no one there had heard from you in quite some time and--.” Afina exhaled, separating herself from Eliran and resting her hands on his upper arms. “I’m so glad to see you, how _are_ you?”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-01*

As a man brought into a sudden hug, he only knew one thing to do, kindly reciprocate. After exchanging the customary cheek pecks, Eliran waited out Afina's sudden barrage of questions, knowing that once she got going there was no possibility of getting a word in edgewise. Eliran smiled at her reaction, giving a slight chuckle, "I'm doing fine as you can see," he said with a grin, "Though some people might have me broiled via light magic in front of the house of god." He added with mock reproach. "I'm in Eraia for an archery tournament, and Trisp specifically because I have mail for a Bishop named Dean and the friends I met along the way needed to visit." He exclaimed, perfectly glossing over his lack of writing back, "enough about me though, how are you? You certainly seem to have grown up a little since the last I saw you," he said looking her down, "I daresay you've even put on a bit of muscle since the last time. What happened to being a bookworm?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

Excited to be seeing such a positive reminder of home (and more importantly, a friend), Afina let most of Eliran’s teasing slide. The princess stood straighter as the Eblian inquired about her welfare, resting her fists on her hips. “I’ve been travelling for weeks from Tyndall Tower in Theanovene. I’m here for a cultural exchange that Master Witella-- you remember him-- was able to garner for me. While I’m quite proficient in light magic-- as you may also remember-- I’m finding this a valuable opportunity to expand upon that which I already know.” Afina raised her chin higher. “In fact, I’ve also taken up sword fighting since you’ve last seen me. My--”

The princess hesitated, realizing that Elfriede was probably still wandering the market, waiting for her to turn. “My… uh… my escort Elfriede actually taught me. He was the one sent from Eraia to bring me here. He actually… might still be waiting for me to return. I had only run back to the monastery because it seems I’ve misplaced that pin that father gave me so long ago.” She laughed nervously. “But you should come to meet his acquaintance, I’m sure you would love him!”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-01*

"You've taken up _sword_ fighting?" Eliran whistled, "you've definitely been busy." _An Eraian escort? I bet he's a Lylalel praising zealot_ he thought to himself, _at least he got her here safe._ "I can't wait to meet him." He said with a smile, "I'll definitely join you, if your staying here do you know the Bishop? The sooner I deliver this the better. My companions aren't used to Eraia, so I can't help but think they might end up breaching some form of courtesy and cause problems in town" _Especially Nokri, If anything goes wrong they could kill her for being a spy_.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

"Yes of course," Afina said. "I'll take the letter to the Bishop for you while I grab my brooch. You two can wait right out here," she said, holding her palm open to receive the letter. _I wonder if Eliran trusts me enough to do so_, she thought.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-01*

Eliran gave a sad smile, "Sorry princess, no can do. Mail goes to the recipient directly. Even if I know you well its the rules." he shrugged, "You could always just show me to the bishop instead?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-01*

Afina squinted at Eliran and turned around with a grumble. "Yes, of course, I'll show you inside. But when we're finished we must be getting back to the market!"

Characters: Aldus, Elfriede, and Nokri

```

Aldus is immediately taken aback by this newcomers hostile attitude. He backs up half a step defensively ,  and starts to reach for his weapon before the auburn haired man drops rapier back in its sheath.  He lowers his defense in return and studies the man inquisitively.  "While I'm sure help would be appreciated, you'll surely understand our.... hesitance, yes? You went from wanting to attack you wanting to help in a matter of moment. Is there a particular reason why you would reacted that way? How can we trust your offer of help is exactly that and nothing more? Given your first impression I'm sure you understand my line of reasoning" He smiles polity at the man.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-04*

Was this guy actually going to draw a sword on them in the middle of the street? *Yeah, think again bucko.* Nokri glanced at Aldus. To an outsider, this would appear to be a glance of concern or worry. But anyone who knew Nokri's true nature could understand the *real* meaning of thislook. *Get a load of this guy, am I right? Who does he think he is?* It was as close to rolling her eyes as she could get without being offensive.

Instead, she did a little curtsy, wincing after bending her leg at an unusual angle. She made a mental note to patch that up later. "Good day, sir. I apologize for his rude manner of speech," she started, gesturing to Aldus, "but he is correct. We haven't had the most... pleasant of days recently so do understand that we're hesitant to follow a stranger."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Aldus blinks at Nokri's polite response *Oh today just keeps getting more interesting* he thinks while he waits for the man response.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-04*

"I apologise for my initial rudeness." He says while glancing around looking for a certain princess. "But you'll have to take me at my word, as ... A Knight of Eraia." 

He spoke hesitantly as he realized that his ranking likely meant nothing to these outsiders. 

"P-please just come with me,I promise you won't come to any harm in the blinding daylight and busy streets of the market."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

Aldus is confused. Why ever would this man want to help so badly? He was obviously a knight like he claimed... civic duty perhaps? "very well then I suppose. My name is Aldus Larian, and I'm not a local, if that wasn't obvious." there is no malice in his naive tone as he says this.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-04*

Elfriede bows slightly, "Pleasure to meet you Sir Larian."
Faun then eyes the girl expectantly. "Is this acceptable to her ladyship?"

Elfriede mentally sighed in relief, *Good.. this doesn't have to get ugly..* He paused a moment in thought looking at the two, still unsure what to make of them. *Such an odd pairing..*

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-04*

"If Aldus is willing to trust you..." Nokri nodded, ok with going along if they just stayed in the public eye. Aldus would probably blindly trust a scarecrow if Nokri threw a decent shirt over it and pretended it could talk, but if this so-called knight wanted to immediately kill them he would have already gotten it over with. She wasn't going to say her name unless prompted again, though. Nokri preferred to get more information about the situation. "You said we should go to the temple? Is it open to the public masses?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-04*

"Not... exactly. The church of Lylalel part is of course, but the healing services usually "cost" a small pittance of tithe. I'll cover this for you of course, I do not expect that someone in your current condition has much in the way of resources... Unless." Elfriede looks back up to Aldus. "Unless you hired this man for protection?"

"And we can talk a bit while we're there, maybe I can help you find... Whatever it is, whilst you're here."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-04*

"I appreciate your concern good sir, but I am okay. I don't require any healing services, with the right supplies and a little bit of time I can heal myself." *And I'm not paying for some shams to come mumble a few words over me in the name of god.*

Nokri smiled, but held back her laughter. If she had the money she'd pay for way more than some dog. She'd be riding around in a gold palanquin. "No, Aldus and I are merely traveling together. He aided me a great deal as of late."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-04*

His tone dropping a bit, Elfriede's visage went from apologetic to more serious. "I don't want this to be an unnessasary scene Drecan. If you are truly of innocent origins, you'll come with me." He said rather quietly.

It was a rather amusing scene, Faun standing there holding the princess's belongings.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-04*

"huh?" Aldus is confused by the man's words. *Why would it matter if she's Drecian* despite this he feels hesitant once again. But he has no thought if getting in trouble today.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-05*

"Pardon?" Nokri took offense to his words and it greatly showed. "Did you call me a Drecan? I don't appreciate being vilified in such a way." Aldus's audible confusion was a nice bonus. She had no clue why he was confused, but it would help sell the act.

"We've already agreed to go with you, haven't we sir? We wish to avoid unnecessary trouble as much as you but we would prefer to keep things civil and *not* spew insults at one another. If you can promise us that, we shall follow."

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-05*

Elfriede scrunched up his nose a bit at her comment. "Fine." He conceded. He had his mind made up that she was Drecan, but now he was second guessing himself. Was all this drama for nothing? Maybe she was some odd mix of Eraia and Laeran having blonde hair which was not so common in Eraia. 
..but her eyes and her tan skin... Elfriede sighed. "I can indeed promise you that. Let's be on our way." Faun wanted this whole situation resolved already, these two were already giving him a headache that he did not need.

```Characters: Aldus, Eliran, Nokri, Desi, Elfriede, Afina
Location: Trist Market Place```
While hearing Afina's hurried support put Eliran slightly at ease, his eyes narrowed at Elfriedes referral to Nokri as a 'Drecan,'. Before Eliran could respond he heard Nokri deny it. He looked Elfriede in the eye, still between the Knight and Nokri. 
"Nokri is no Drecan, she's a proud citizen of Theanovene _sir_" His eyes looked hard, "And she'd be in better shape if it weren't for some racist zealots kidnapping her just over the border. On the _Calloran_ side." He sighed, as if tired, "Like some people they just went and assumed based off of appearance, and almost killed her." Eliran looked again at Elfriede, "Aren't people who make baseless accusations like that the worse?" He said with an extremely polite sounding tone. 
"I assure you sir, Nokri here has been my traveling companion and has nothing to do with your nations _war. _ We're here to find some herbs, deliver some mail, and look into how the trades have faired." Eliran said with sincerity, he then offered a hand, "Either way we've started off on the wrong foot, My name is Eliran Cantaret, of the Cantaret Household and Trading Company. I've heard good things from Afina about you." He added, slightly less aggressively polite, and more genuine.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-14*

Elfriede annoyed gaze turned to yet another person who approached. *Why has this suddenly become a mob of people...*, he thought as he noticed some townfolk staring. He looked down slighty to the new woman and his gaze visably softened a bit. She spoke to him politely in a Colloran accent, "*G-good afternoon sir Knight."* She then lightly curtsied and brought an unsteady hand out to Elfriede. 
Elfriede paused for an uncomfortable few moments considering her and her overwhelming politeness.... and her obvious childlike ignorance of the current tradtions. Although he was impressed that she knew *this* much.

Faun bent down slightly and cuped his hands around hers over and under. "Please my Lady... Only the Knights much older then I still honor that tradition. I did not mean to make you uncomfortable to great me, but I'm impressed by your knowledge of our old traditions." For a brief moment Desi and Elfriede seemed comically disconnected from the current conversation. He bowed lightly and stood back up facing the three in question.

```*Eliran says his piece*```

Elfriedes eyes narrow a bit and he felt his teeth begin to grit a small amount, his pacifistic tone really chaffing Faun's pride. *Is this man mocking me?* Eliran broke his concentration by offering a hand, "*I've heard great things from Afina about you.*" The Knight-Leiutenant really did not want to let the whole situation go... but finally gave in with an annoyed sigh. He took Eliran's hand and shook it. *Odd she hasn't mentioned you...*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

Eliran knew when somebody was getting annoyed with him. He had a way with words that often left him in a socially more appropriate view, and forced his counterparts in conversation into social traps, like with the handshake he just offered. One look at Elfriede and Eliran knew that while the matter had been settled for now, he would probably have to placate the knight later to avoid more confrontation, _Maybe we could bond over a drink or something_ he mused to himself. Eraians soldiers weren't known for the alcoholic tendency, but Eliran had found that in the past they were uptight folk that really needed a little liquor to get much needed relaxation. He gave the man a firm handshake and looked to Afina, "So... do you need to return to your 1 on 1 night out.. or would you guys like to join us for dinner?" he asked.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-14*

It was only then that Afina realized that she had scarcely been breathing. She forced a smile at the small group collected in the marketplace. “Ah, yes, well-- we weren’t on a dinner alone really it was just us simply exploring the marketplace.” Afina gingerly took her bag back from Elfriede, giving a small nod and a smile that seemed to signal both “thanks” and “sorry” to the knight. “Either way. Dinner sounds delightful. There is much we might be able to learn from each other’s voyages, so I am anxious to hear of what you have encountered,” she declared, cupping her hands together. A tense vibe still hung in the air, but the princess was quick to try to displace it. 

Eyeing Eliran’s companions, the princess took it upon herself to offer her most polite introduction. _Especially when it seems that something had set Elfriede off,_ she thought, glancing warily at the knight before turning to address the small blonde woman and the white-haired laguz in Eliran’s party. “Might I introduce myself before we go to eat together. I’m quite glad to see that Eliran is keeping company, as his usual self is wont to do. I am Princess Afina Tyndall of Laera, in the kingdom Callora. Though Eliran’s family does not hail from Laera as I do, he is like a compatriot and blood to myself.” She bowed her head in a quick nod. “I hope he has not caused too much trouble,” she said with a knowing expression. Afina’s eyes hesitated on the tall white-haired laguz for a moment, remembering Atalantia, before quickly darting away to look at the ground.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-06-14*

Everyone seemed very awkward and uncomfortable, much to Nokri's amusement. She didn't care about her ragged clothes anymore now that uptight knight boy was put in his place. Eliran's behavior was also pleasantly surprising, and she nodded along to every word of his partially-bogus story. She considered giving him a pat on the back later. Her, a legal Theanovene citizen. Hehe. And him, the... heir of... the Cantaret trading company?

*Woah woah woah woah. Careful with your tall tales, associating yourself so boldly with such a well-known company... That's something people can trace through public records.* Nokri's thinking slowed to a halt. Then, it started racing. Technically, nothing he had said was an outright lie. What was Eliran's last name, anyway? Had it always been that? Nokri couldn't remember for the life of her. She stared at the ground while lost in thought, eyes the size of dinner plates. *Is that why he knows so many people? Not because he sleeps around all the time?* Nokri moved her stare to Eliran, looking at him as though it was for the first time. *What the [censored].* She snapped her neck towards Aldus. Did he know about this?

Now was not the time for a crisis. She took a deep breath and smiled. Everything was totally natural. Everything was fine. *Why didn't he tell me. I could've been selling my potions and making a pretty penny with connections like that.* Fine. It's all fine. Back to the conversation at hand.

At the moment Nokri wasn't very hungry, especially after the weird hand display that Desii and sword slicin' mcgee put on and the sudden announcement from Mr. "I'm actually rich" boy, but she wouldn't pass up a chance to chow down if given the opportunity. Doubly so if the food was free. *Especially* if Mr. so-called Cantaret might be willing to elaborate a little on his background. Plus the least Mr. Knight could do for them would be pay for their dinner. "Indeed, with some good food perhaps we can put this all behind us. Right, Aldus?"

The blonde woman was in agreement, and a little flustered? She was pretty hasty to deny that she and the knight were going to eat dinner alone together. The color drained from Nokri's face as she introduced herself. *Pppppppprincess??? Nooooooooooooooooooohohohoho way.* The girl did look the part though, and had been acting pretty princess-y in the 60 seconds since she arrived. Was this all some messed up fever dream, and Nokri was still rotting in a cave somewhere? Did this girl and Eliran devise some sneaky prank to mess with them? The clock was ticking, and it would be strange to stay silent. Nokri deduced that even if this girl wasn't a princess, her social status was far above Nokri's and just humoring her might win some favor.

She bowed back, "I apologize, I did not realize we were in the presence of royalty, your majesty. This has been no trouble at all, I'm sure your knight was only acting in his best interests." She didn't lift her head, instead staying in a bow while mentally trying to wrap her mind around what in the world was happening.

"M-my name is Nokri Lyleon, it is an utmost pleasure to make your acquaintance," she stammered. It had been a long time since using formal etiquette. Most polite encounters were done in a shop-based setting. *Shoot, shoot. I messed up. I lost my cool. Way to slip up in front of the princess, dipstick.*

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-06-14*

He is more than surprised the Eliran’s hurried defense of Nokri, further cementing the claim that he didn't think Aldus was crazy for wanting to protect her. It’s more apparent to him now that Nokri was the true target here. Himself only being guilty by association. Although he’s still not sure what this knight thinks she is guilty of exactly. Aldus hadn’t realised the war had gotten so bad that people were starting witch hunts in the streets for apparent Drecans. Perhaps Nokri *was* guilty of something, perhaps she had gotten caught stealing something, or her shady potions dealing finally caught up with her. He was thinking too far into this…

Eliran has quite the way with words, the way he turns the situation to politeness quickly. He gives himself quite the introduction too, much more fanciful than the one given to Aldus weeks ago, Aldus has never heard of the Cantaret Household and Trading Company, but it sounds impressive, A title worthy of standing up to a Knight Lieutenant of Eraia. He glances down to Nokri the surprise at the given title evident on his face *Did you know about this?!* he tries to say wordlessly, finding the answer in the similar look she is giving him. 

Desii seems to be aware of some custom he is not, although her Guide to Eraian Pleasantries may be a little outdated by the way Knight Lieutenant Faun responds, he idly hopes this custom only applies to women. Her gesture does seem to defuse the knight a bit though.

Faun sighs, obviously annoyed at the bard, but does not press the issue further. Eliran follows the Knights social defeet with "So... do you need to return to your 1 on 1 night out.. or would you guys like to join us for dinner?" This statement confuses Aldus for two reasons; The first is it seems quite out of place to suggest a meal with someone who nearly caused an altercation just moments ago, perhaps this is the custom here? The other reason being that he’s pretty positive of of these two humans has recently spent the night, or perhaps day, with a Naissankari. Are they already onto their next conquest? Are knights or Eraia even permitted to be so? Could the woman perhaps be the one? But she doesn't seem the sort, she seems regal, put together. Although Aldus has no doubt she could have any she desired to be her bed warmer. Or maybe Eliran has just been speedy this time around. 

The new blonde woman seems to be an old friend of Elirans, or perhaps a past lover? The stings of possibilities are quickly getting tangled in Aldus’s mind. Even more so when She introduces herself as Princess Afina Tyndall of Laera. Aldus is beginning to feel quite uncomfortable with all this fancy titles and positions. He doesn't even have a title, even if he had the title his father intended for him, it would command the same respect here as it does at home. Nokri is also obviously impressed by all these titles as well, evident in the way he voice drips with politeness and faked kindness.

Aldus clears his throat, having not spoken as of yet due to awe at the situation. And chuckles nervously. “Is this what the people of this area do when they have a dispute? Have a meal together? This is an interesting concept, such a situation would not be settled the same where I am from, nevertheless I would be happy to try to get passed whatever just happened and move on. I am Aldus Larian of Wynne” he says trying to make his unimpressive title stand up to the likes of knights and princesses. He bows fluidly to the princess before meeting her crystal blues with his deep emeralds “I am afraid that I do not know the proper custom for greeting a Calorian Princess, I hope that will suffice.”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-14*

Eliran watched Aldus' awkward introduction with a sympathetic eye. Looking to nokri  he noticed she wore a similar expression of shock at the titles going around. He hadn't told his companions his full identity for this reason. Because titles, while useful,  tended to create barriers and expectations that he didn't like while traveling. 
At Aldus' nervous comment he responded with a small laugh, "A meal together isn't the normal solution for a dispute no," he then gestured to Afina, "however tonight I get to see a friend I haven't met in a year, so in my mind that means a meal is in order." 
he looked at the group with grin, "plus, I know a great place here, one of the few that actually hosts performances as well!" He said with a hint of childish glee.  "And music is the best way to solve all problems."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

```
Characters: Afina Tyndall and Eliran Canteret
Location: Afina's Guest Room in the Trisp Monastery
```

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

Eliran opened the door after a light courtesy knock. "The light of whom?" He asked with an eyebrow raised "I only see a wee little princess in here." He teased with a grin.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

The sparks from Afina's light spell promptly fizzled out as she saw who entered. "Hmph, and I only see a merchant boy who doesn't know how to write," Afina said with a wry smile.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

_Shit she remembered_ Eliran thought, "you know the only thing I've ever written is music" He offered hesitantly with a slightly humorous sound. _she's never gonna let this go_

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"One would think after being near inseparable in our youth that you would at least write _once_," Afina insisted, folding her arms. She suddenly realized how childish that sounded, like she was throwing a tantrum, and promptly unfolded them. "Even when I moved to Theanovene, you weren't even there. There's an awful lot of books to keep a Laeran occupied at Tyndall Tower, but nothing quite like an old friend." She pursed her lips.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

"I'm sorry ok, its just been a crazy year and I haven't had any time" Eliran stepped into the room proper and lightly closed the door, "and I didn't even spend much time in Theanovene.... Wait you were in Theanovene???" He asked, realizing what she had said.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"Yes," Afina huffed, closing her light magic book and setting on the table next to her brooch. "Father sent me there after a problem with the handmaid. It was shameful, I don't particularly want to discuss it." She frowned. "The point being. Eliran. It's been far too long, I was quite lonely. You know better than anyone how few friends I had in Callora."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

Eliran plopped next to her and ruffled her hair a bit, "I know and I'm sorry." he said, "though next time if you want me to visit you could tell me you're in town? My dad lives there and he keeps track of where all of our caravans go."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"I didn't know where to write! And with Itory... and I was stuck there... and..." Afina trips over her words, looking at Eliran with wide, glossy eyes. "All I did was study, I cannot tell you how many times I wished to be a child again and run through the creek with my _best friend Eliran_ once more."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

Eliran thought back to the creek days from when he was 6,"I don't think you want to run through the creek like we did back then... considering how we did it..." He mused slightly, stroking his chin as if in deep thought. "Though it would definitely give weight to those old betrothal rumors" he chuckled

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

Afina's cheeks flared up a bright red. "You know that I don't mean _that_ part of it!" she yelled, shoving him playfully with a smile. "Though you give a good point. Those were quite the rumors. The Laeran paper ran such reports for quite some time. I assume after a while they realized they were wrong." She folds her arms, lifting her chin. "Technically, there's still time for you, however," she said slyly.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

Eliran chuckled, "Sure thing, imagine that. Me, a king. The wars that countries would start with us just because of my sass." he shook his head, "No I  think that relationship can stay in the old Laeran papers."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"For the good of Laera, I shan't marry you then," she grinned. "Unless, of course, neither of us are married by 40. In which case, I'll marry you out of _pity_," she laughed, a loud and honest laugh that she hadn't allowed herself to have in a long while. "Irregardless, Eliran. I'm quite glad you're back. I _did_ miss you, you know," she said quietly, scooting closer to the man from her childhood. She wrapped her arms around him and squeezed tightly, nuzzling into his shoulder.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

Eliran returned the hug, holding Afina in his arms tightly, "I missed you too," He gave her a light kiss on the forehead, "And I'm sorry about not writing. Its been a _long_ year." He added while comfortingly rubbing her shoulder. "Though, lets be honest, If anybody should be worried about marriage by 40 its you. When was last time you got close to somebody huh?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"I'll have you know that there are scores of men after me! Loads. Not even all Laeran. I was close to someone, just the other night, you know!" she gloated proudly. Sure, Eliran was going to assume she was _with_ someone, in which case she would have to correct him. But she was proud to have bonded with at least one person, whilst Eliran had been spending much of his life bonding with _many_ people.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

"Oh really, did you two hold hands?" He asked teasingly as he poked her side.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"Yes! Yes we did Sir Undergarments-Down-Upon-Meeting," she chided playfully. "Nonetheless, why do you need to know? Reporting back to my father? I'm sure you've been quite busy in your travels yourself."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

"I'll have you know, my pants may be down, but my heart is closed" He said with mock dignity. "A friendly romp with somebody is nothing to be ashamed of." He look at her through the corner of his eyes, "And why wouldn't I want to know what my best friends relationship status is. After a year at your age you could have gotten married for all I know."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

"Well, you'll be pleased to know that you haven't missed anything, then. There's someone I'm interested in, and I have reason to suspect he is as well, but I'm not entirely sure anything could come of it. There's... barriers. In the way," Afina pulled her knees to her chest and hugged them, thankful that her nightgown was long enough to prevent any uncomfortable sights from being seen.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

"Oh..?" Eliran looked at her, no longer teasing her, "Who is it?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

Afina bit her lip, eyes glancing towards the wall that she knew her room shared with Elfriede's next door. "You know... that knight... Eraian..." the princess said slowly, not entirely wanting to commit to admitting such things aloud. She mustered up enough courage. "My escort."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

"Another Knight?" Eliran said with an eyebrow raised, then added slow and carefully, ".... well thats good. Just... be careful ok?" He looked at her seriously, "A lot can happen when you travel, especially when you get into dangerous situations.." he paused shortly, a sad look briefly appeared in  his eyes, "You can get close without really knowing somebody."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

Afina watched as Eliran's eyes darkened; Clearly such an experience had really hurt him before. It wasn't often that the Eblian was serious, though he was more than capable of being so. It was infrequent that Afina had seen her friend so affected; When they were children, Eliran had always been the confident and strong one (which she had often attributed it to him have two years on her). "Ah well, even if nothing comes of it, I still have your friendship." Afina ruffled his hair. "Especially after I buy you proper stationary and ink!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-21*

With his hair properly messed up Eliran couldn't help but laugh, "Hey stop it," he said swatting her hand away, "Since when were you the hair ruffler here??" He added countering by ruffling the Princesses hair. He relaxed, putting his back against the wall behind her beds headboard. "Its good to see you again Afrin."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-21*

Afina blew the strands of blonde hair away from her face. "Good to see you as well, Eliran. Perhaps this time we won't part so quickly. Are you sure you'll be alright in that inn with your friends? I would offer you a place here, but sadly that would take much more conniving than I believe I'm skilled in."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-22*

"Probably for the best, if I stayed who knows what the others would think" Eliran mused. He shook is head at the thought, then paused. He was unsure if he still wanted to mention Enera, the night was approaching swiftly and discussing the potential of a church kidnapping was not necessarily something he wanted to do with the potential ears nearby. 
"Afina... about the girl you mentioned at dinnee." He thought again, remembering the Eraian knight next door. _I definitely can't trust his view on this_ Eliran thought, thinking of the Knights knee gut reaction to Nokri and his pre-existing suspicion of their company. "Ah never mind, we need to talk but it can wait for tomorrow." He ruffled her hair one last time as he stood up, "now I'll let you get some alone time with your knight boy" he added teasingly. "Dont break your bed, monastery mattresses arent known for their durability."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

"I-- what!? You little dumb--" Afina grabbed a hold of her pillow and shoved it in Eliran's face in an attempt to smother him. "Don't make such suggestions, we are in a holy building right now!"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-22*

Eliran, who was already standing and if her bed, easily caught and held afinas pillow away from his face as she tried to smother him in vain. "Okay okay," he conceded laughing. "I'll see you tomorrow?" He asked

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina lowered her makeshift weapon in defeat. "Yes, indeed. I'll see you tomorrow, Eliran. Goodnight," she said, giving him one last hug for the night. She felt like she should say some other well-wishing words, but a "goodnight" would suffice for then.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-22*

Eliran returned the hug with a tight squeeze, and then before letting her go have Afina a light kiss on the forehead, emulating the Laeran tradition. "Sleep well Afrin." He added before heading out the door and homeword.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina plopped back down on the bed as he departed, a light creak squeaking from the mattress as she did so. _Well, it seems he's the same old Eliran,_ she thought.

[END ASIDE]

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

```Elfriede Faun, Afina Tyndall
Afina’s Temporary bedroom, Trisp```

Faun paced back and forth in his room a bit thinking about how much of a fool he made of himself today. He needed to apologize to several people including the princess. *Plus she wanted to talk tonight...” 

“But, my actions weerent without merit… I mean she was clearly…”
It didn’t matter and he knew it. He exited his room heading over to Afina’s but stopped in his tracks when he heard a male voice. *That man from earlier.* He felt a heavy tug on his heart, Elfriede wanted nothing more than to respect her privacy but…*something* drove him forwards.

“--robably for the best, if i stayed who knows what the others would think.” Elfriede abruptly stopped again. After a brief moment he returned to his room, not wanted to hear anymore and jumble his thoughts. After a few minutes he heard footsteps passed his door heading for the exit. He waited a few minutes which felt like forever just in case and exited his room yet again. He *needed* to talk to her, for many reasons, some he didn’t fully understand.

Faun got to the doorway and gently knocked on its trim not looking in right away, as was the honorable thing to do. “...Fina? ...You wanted to see me tonight?” He felt a slight tremble in his voice. “I have some things I wanted to talk about as well.” *His mind drifting against his will to the handsome bard.*

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina's heart sank as she heard Elfriede on the other side of her door. _Right, there were things we said that we would discuss when we got to Trisp_, she remembered, holding her pillow tighter. "Come in!" the princess beckoned, more tense than she had been earlier. "Don't think I forgot, of course. But what was it you were hoping to talk about first?" Afina fidgeted as she sat on the bed, realizing that sitting cross legged was not entirely comfortable. She shifted to tuck her legs underneath her. _Perhaps it's the nerves more than anything_, she thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

Elfriede entered and eyed the princess in her nightgown. He sighed a tiny bit and walked over to the bed grabbing its frame at the end and glancing down. “First… I want to apologize to you for causing a scene earlier… it is just the Drecan girl… I’m sorry.. No excuses for my behavior.” He bowed slightly to her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina blinked in surprise, fully anticipating another topic. "Oh. Well your apology is greatly appreciated and accepted. I understand that your nations are at war; if it were myself I would have done the same thing. Prejudice is a form of ignorance, which all Laerans try to avoid, but. Sometimes it happens anyways. All that really matters is that the situation has been resolved. The Drecan girl doesn't seem to hold it against you." _Though whether or not a free meal may have played an integral role in smoothing tensions is still to be debated_, Afina thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

Elfriede nodded a bit and moved to sit down next to Afina on the bed. And paused a bit before the selfish topic he was about to dig into.

 "So... How... Aquanted are you with the Bard? You have not really said anything about your relationship with him." , he said to her with both a hint of curiousity and a touch of something more selfish.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina wanted to laugh. This conversation was much lighter than that she had been anticipating. "Eliran? We were friends in our youth. His grandfather was well acquainted with mine; Consequently, we were introduced to each other at a young age. My family also helped to train him in the ways of noble etiquette. Is... there a reason you're asking?" Afina inquired with a puzzled expression.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

"N-No I was just curious is all.. " Elfriede awkward ly fidgeted in place. "I..". 
A few brief moments passed and he move his hand to hers. 

"We.. wanted to discuss something?" He finally got out, his chest tightening a bit.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

_Oh, there's the topic I was bracing for,_ Afina thought as Elfriede reached his hand out for hers. She laced her fingers with his, hoping her hold didn't betray her nervous state. Afina's heart beat hard in her chest; She couldn't remember that last time she felt so nervous, if she could even think at all. Her thoughts were scattered, and the princess grasped for the first one that she could find. "When we were in the woods outside Trisp. You said that you wanted to be selfish. What did you mean?" Afina kept her gaze down, purposely avoiding eye contact with Elfriede. She was already experiencing difficulty in focus; His disarming and thoughtful gaze would make speaking her mind that much more difficult.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

Faun squeezed her hand a bit unknowingly when he heard her question. They sat there as a few moments passed while he gathered his thoughts. He thought briefly that they probably looked amusing, both if them staring at the floor unable to raise there gaze at each other. He had to though... If he was to explain himself properly. 

He slowly raised his head and turned it towards her. "...I wanted to be close to you."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina felt a light squeeze from Elfriede's hand, and she shifted her gaze from the floor to their hands. She knew what she wanted to ask, but just couldn't find it in herself to put such a question into words. _If I were Eliran, this would be so much easier_, she thought, cursing him in her mind. The princess felt Elfriede's gaze trying to meet hers, but she couldn't muster up the courage to do so herself. She shifted in her seat again, mulling over the thousands of questions she could ask the knight next. "Is that... something you still want now?"

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

Elfriede a free hand found it's way to her cheek and lightly turned her head toward his. His heart beating hard in his chest. 

"I... Would think so..." he finally got out as he stared into her blue orbs, which were sparkling a bit in the reflected candle light.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina could feel her blood run cold with adrenaline as Elfriede turned her face towards his, and she found herself immersed in his amber stare. It was like someone had turned off her mind, and the princess could scarcely form words. She didn’t have time to think anymore, she could only speak from the heart. In a way, Afina was terrified. Everything she did, she analyzed and thought about, it was just the Laeran way. But now was the best time as any to be honest. What had she told Eliran after all? _There's someone I'm interested in, and I have reason to suspect he is as well,_ echoed in her mind. 

“I don’t want you to leave when our time in Trisp is concluded. There’s still so much I want to experience, I don’t feel like I’ve had enough time with you.” 

Part of Afina wanted to run and hide for saying things so blatantly, honestly. The other part, however… was content to be exactly where she was.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

The honesty that the two shared was freeing. Elfriede felt both releaved and terrified for the future. He didn't know how to talk to her in this manner. He didn't know how to bring up his heritage or when. He didn't know how long they would be able to remain together.

Even so Elfriede's face went flush as he leaned forward and embraced her. He held her for a few moments before slowly retreating in to looking her in the eyes again. 

"I don't know what this means for us in the future, and... quite honestly I'm afraid.. Fina.. I've never..." He paused, the words briefly caught. "...felt like this." 

He couldn't tell if he was being foolish, or was blinded by his foolishness, but he wanted to put aside everything in his life to have her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

_Elfriede_ did _feel the same way_, Afina thought as the two embraced. In that moment, it was as if all the anxiety had melted away as she held the knight closely. Afina felt secure in knowing that her feelings were reciprocated, that Elfriede had like been thinking the same things that she had been recently. “We can never know what the future may bring. But… at least now… we might be assured knowing that at least we’ll have each other.”

The princess once again held Elfriede’s hand in her own, shyly looking away. “I’ve never had a better time than these past few weeks I’ve spent. Falling for you,” Afina said, hesitating on the last phrase, the words feeling odd coming from her. But in a way, it also felt right. Should anything happen to them, she would at least be able to rest assured that her feelings were reciprocated.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

Hearing her words caused his heart to start racing, beating unbelievably hard in his chest. “Fina… I just…” His body forced him forwards. 

He looked at her in a different light now. He noticed the way her hair fell on her shoulders, her eyes, her slightly parted lips looking as if they wanted to say something more to him. He stared at them for a second, his body forcing him forward until he felt them against his as he pressed into her. A soft warm sensation flowed through his mind and body and he embraced her. He held himself there against her for… he didn’t know how long.. Until they finally separated his face slowly backing away from hers. Princess Tyndall and Knight Lieutenant Faun looking into eachothers eyes once again.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

In an instant, Afina felt Elfriede’s lips on hers and it was like a thousand sensations were bombarding the princess’ senses. She could feel Elfriede’s face, warm against her own. Her hands, caught between the two of them, grasped the soft fabric of his nightshirt. Her very being felt warmed by the kiss, incomparable to any sensation she had felt before.

The two parted, and Afina realized that she still held onto Elfriede’s shirt tightly. She laughed as she let go, lighthearted and giddy from the kiss. “Who would have thought that the upstanding Eraian knight would be caught with a Callorian princess,” Afina said with a sly smile, her face still inches from his own. She wasn’t sure how _done_ they were (_Nobles traditionally weren’t particularly affectionate to begin with,_ Afina thought), but it was clear something more had to be said for their actions.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

His smiled at her and they sat still for a few moments, senses overwhelmed by the kiss. His heart still forcing him ever onward, while his mind screamed for him to stop. Elfriede could hardly believe his actions. Before he knew it he gently was laying the princess back and interlocking lips with her again as she laid down. He backed away a bit hanging over her prone form. 

He smirked playfully, unable to relieve himself of his joking-competitive nature even in the moment... “Somewhat reminds me of our sparring match back at Ransfords camp... for you are pinned again Miss Tyndall.”

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

“And you may very well underestimate me, Sir Faun,” she said, reaching up to unbutton his shirt. At any other time, the princess might have hesitated to admire the smooth purple fabric, but at the moment it was nothing more than a barrier. Afina threw the garment to the side, not entirely concerned with keeping track of it. “Perhaps pinned beneath my knight is exactly where I want to be.” 

Afina pulled Elfriede back towards her once more, her hands running through his caramel colored hair. She had never been so close to someone before, physically nor emotionally, but in a way, everything she did with Elfriede felt right. The princess separated from him suddenly, breathless. “Did… you want to…?” she asked hesitantly, nodding downwards.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-22*

Elfriede smirked genuinely at the princess's retort. He allowed her quickly unbotton his top and throw it aside, causing adrenline to run through his veins, his face feeling tingly and his breathing escalated. They came together again kissing passionatly as she grabbed his hair in fistfulls. When they separated she looked at him and asked the question he had been asking himself for the passed few minutes. Upon hearing her confirmation he leaned back in slowly and kissed her neck, running one hand up the outside of her thigh. Faun's mind screaming at him **no**, this will only end in disaster. *She HAS to know first.*

For a moment he ignored his logic. His hand kept rising under her gown and over her hip gently passing over her waistband of her undergarments and up to her bare waist. Faun felt his whole body was heating up, ~~his loins pulsed in anticipation~~, he wanted nothing but her.  

*but...* suddenly Elfriede froze and backed off removing his hand and backing away from her neck. *He couldn't... He had to explain to her proper... and not now, that would be wrong.*  He looked up at Afina defeated, hair a mess, and sulking a bit. "Perhaps.. we should wait."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-22*

Afina herself was enraptured in the ecstasy of the moment, not entirely sure what she was doing, but well assured that it was pleasurable. She felt Elfriede all over; his body pressed against hers, his lips grazed her neck, his hand stroked her thigh. The princess suddenly realized that she might have to explain the scar on her torso, but quickly dismissed such a thought, far too enthralled with being in such intimate proximity with Elfriede.

And then, he stopped. Elfriede backed away, and Afina cocked her head in confusion. She quickly sat up straight. _Something must be wrong,_ she thought, worriedly. Perhaps his own previous injuries had been upset. Afina looked Elfriede up and down quickly; At first glance, nothing seemed wrong. There was a certain defeated posture about him, like he had just been admonished. _Was it something I did?_ she wondered, confused though mostly worried about such an abrupt change in attitude. And then came the fateful words, _perhaps we should wait_.

Afina nodded slowly as she processed what Elfriede said. _Wait? Wait for what? We very well may be separated once you have to return back to the military, isn’t there a sense of urgency about this?_ she thought. “Yes… yes, this is true. You make a fair statement,” she said, running a hand through her hair and exhaling. “Nothing good comes from rushed intimacy.” The Laeran quickly pulled her nightgown back over her legs. “Did you… want to just. Stay the night. Without that?” Afina asked hesitantly, as if they were reaching a compromise that she wasn’t exactly keen on.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-23*

He just needed a bit of time... to decide what he was going to tell her. Elfriede raised his hand and moved Afina's hair back behind her ear. "Please... give me another day to think it over." He brought his hand down and stroked her shoulder lovingly. 

"You're beautiful Fina... I'd like nothing more than to... continue... tonight, but I need to work through some things first. I'm sorry, please forgive me." He gazed at her, not sure staying the night was the brightest of ideas. It was hard enough to halt himself initiallly, and he still longed for her.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-23*

“Oh,” Afina said, the one word response betraying how quickly her mind was moving. _Maybe it’s an Eraian custom. Perhaps he doesn’t know what he’s doing and he’s nervous he’ll mess up. That’s ridiculous, there is no conceivable notion that he’s inept considering what he was doing just a few seconds ago. What could he possibly need to solve in 24 hours_. She almost wanted to be angry at him because she didn’t understand why he was acting this way. The princess tried to shake the thoughts off. She had to trust that Elfriede was genuine about his feelings, and that it was some external force that was holding him back.

“That’s alright,” she said with a small smile. “If you’re not ready then I’m not ready. It would be unwise to force a situation to work when it simply just doesn’t.” She leaned in and kissed him softly on the cheek. “I’m already quite glad to know that my feelings are reciprocated.” 

The Laeran leaned out of the bed to grab Elfriede’s shirt off the floor. “You’re right next door, so if you change your mind, I’ll be here. Otherwise I doubt you’d want the Cardinal to see you looking like _that_,” she laughed lightly, holding out the shirt to him.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-06-23*

Elfriede sighed feeling quite inadaquate in the circumstance. Afina's words, although pained, comforted him greatly. He accepted the kiss with a smile and kissed her cheek as well. 
Afina laughed lightly and handed him his shirt. *Have I chosen wrong? should I have just continued?* Questions bombarded his mind. He looked at Afina and couldn't believe how caring she was towards him. He felt his eyes burn as wetness came to them. *I dont want her to see me cry... not tonight... I need to go* "He walked over to the door holding his shirt limply at his side. 

"Thank you for understanding Afina... I... Have a good night sleep. I look forward to see you in the morning." He flashed his disarming smile and shut her door.

Faun slowly paced back to his room, tears building up at the edges of his eyes. *I... cannot be sure but...* He thought of Afina's face, kissing her, touching her body, how sweet she to him was despite his withdrawel. Tears finally spilled over a bit and ran down his cheeks. *I think I love her..*

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-06-23*

~~Eliran looked in the door. "ITS JUST NO CLOTHES ON PENUS IN VAGINA"~~

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-06-23*

“Goodnight, sleep well, Elfriede,” Afina said, smiling back at him. The princess hated to watch Elfriede depart after such an emotional exchange, but something was clearly agitating him. It was best to leave him to figure out things himself. The princess burrowed under the covers, rolling over onto her side to stare at the white candle on the side table that casted its flickering light across the room. 

_Where does Elfriede fit into your plans for the future, Afina?_ she asked herself, brows furrowed in thought. She had set out from Theanovene in search of knowledge that would qualify her to be queen of Laera. Now… she wasn’t so sure. She still wanted to provide for her nation, but such a goal also conflicted with her desire to be by Elfriede’s side. And now his strange behavior? That complicated her plans for the future even more so. The princess exhaled. She hoped that Elfriede would come to terms with whatever was ailing him soon enough. If she could figure things out with Elfriede, then she might be able to figure out what her goals were once they departed Trisp. 

_Elfriede..._ The princess’ hand came to her lips as she thought of their exchange. It was just yesterday that they had hesitantly shared a common space, and now. _Kissing_, Afina thought, pulling the covers up to her nose as a pink tint blossomed across her cheeks. _Please think it over quickly, Elfriede. I don’t want to spend any more time apart._

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-03*

```
Characters: Aldus, Afina, Desii
Location: Trisp Monastery
```

Aldus steadies Desii, a little concerned. *She is a jumpy on isn't she* he thinks. 

He notes Afina's posture. *Strange for a mage, isnt it?* 

Also surprised at the coincidence he says"Ah Princess Tyndall! Yes Eliran is quite entertaining but we had business to attend to here this morning. You have great timing by the way! As Desii says there is something we were wondering to ask you but I am unsure it would be within our right to do so."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-03*

_Ah, right, the young woman's name is Desii,_ Afina remembered with a nod. She could only hope that the laguz man's name would also be repeated in time. "I have time to spare before supper tonight. What might it be that you require my assistance for?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-03*

"Oh," he starts, a little surprised at her openness to hear them out . "Well how about we go outside, I think I saw a garden park nearby that shouldn't be very busy right now, perhaps we could talk there?"  He asks a bit timidly, feeling like she must suspect them of something unsavory, but not wanting to ask he Princess anything amongst prying ears.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-03*

"Ah..." Afina said, glancing between the two of them before her. _That certainly sounds suspicious_, she thought. But the princess also wanted to give Eliran's companions the benefit of the doubt. After all, _he_ had found them acceptable enough to travel with. And even still, just because she heard them out did not mean that the Laeran was committed to assisting their cause just yet. "Surely, let's," Afina beckoned, walking towards the door of the monastery. "Lead the way, would you?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-03*

Aldus leads the two women out of the imposing black building and across the street where he has spotted the park earlier that morning. there are two benches set in a small clearing on a brink patio, facing each other. Perfect for a conversation. Aldus motions for Afina to sit on one, while him and Desii take a seat on the other. "That's much better. Thank you for your time Princess Tyndall. Now as far as our question goes, I believe I should let Desii explain."

**Bill** - *2018-07-03*

Desii falls into step behind Afina, letting the Princess walk before her. She watches Afina as she walks, marveling at the air of dignity the noble carries around her. It keeps her attention the entire walk, which in hindsight was a tad awkward of her.

"Right. Um, You see, I was asked by some friends I met in Callora to look for their daughter as I traveled. Her name happens to be Enera, and she was skilled in light magic before her disappearance... So when you mentioned a light magic wielding girl named Enera yesterday I wanted to follow up and meet this girl, on the off chance it's the same person." Desii says, ramrod straight on the bench. It doesn't add to the already uncomfortable bench's appeal, but public speaking isn't a magician's apprentice skill. 

"I tried to meet her this morning, but the Bishop I spoke to, well, in effect, yelled at me for asking. I guess..." Desii purses her lips, as if realizing something. She then taps her index finger on her chin, thinking. "I suppose we thought you might be able to shed some light on why? I'd just like to meet her, to confirm it is in fact a crazy coincidence."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-03*

Afina chuckles at the clever wordplay. "Yes, perhaps I might be able to help shed some _light_ on the situation. Unfortunately, I don't know all that much about the Bishop himself, nor Enera, beyond what I have told you already. My training session this morning with the Bishop seemed to have been... fruitful, so if anything, I am in his good graces." She hesitates. "I don't, however, wish to jeopardize my training by irritating the Bishop with questions he's already refused to answer."

Afina's gaze turned distinct as she mulled over the possible ways she might be able to help. "Perhaps I might be able to go straight to the leader of the monastery. The Cardinal. He offered assistance to me should I need it, but I doubt I would be able to do so in front of guests. What might you wish that I ask him?"

**Bill** - *2018-07-03*

"Just the chance to meet her would be lovely, if only for a few minutes." Desii says, eyes wide. The Princess has more connections than Desii could have imagined. "I don't know how we could repay you, favorable answer or not Princess. I don't have anything of value to offer..." Desii trails.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-03*

Aldus stifles a laugh at the Princess's pun, not expecting a noble of Calora to be so lighthearted. "We don't want to impose, and we certainly wouldn't want to get you into any trouble" Aldus thinks on the subject for a moment "Are light mages quite common in Calora? I've never met one in my life as I'm from Wynne, but yourself, and Enera would make two now"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-03*

Afina raises her hand dismissively. "No need to repay me, consider it a gesture of goodwill from Laera. Any friend of Eliran's is a friend of mine." She then turns to Aldus. "Well, it's almost hard to refer to Callora in general terms when you live inside it. My kingdom of Laera is quite different from its neighbors, and so on and so forth. For Laera in particular, magic is common to learn, as our citizens are constantly in pursuit of knowledge. Light magic though?" Afina tried to calculate the numbers in her head. "A majority of our citizens know some form of magic. Out of those? I would say a good 10% specialize in light magic. It's not common, especially with tensions between Eraia and Callora these days. But it exists all the same."

"Does the same idea hold true for your kingdom as well, Desii?"

**Bill** - *2018-07-03*

"um..." Desii starts, her posture tightening up again at being addressed directly. The Princess's smile was off putting, it made Desii forget the woman's stature and just acknowledge the woman herself. 

"Hylley isn't a big magic capital... In Evard, we only have one Sage, and he's... not a very nice man. I apprenticed with him and eventually decided to set out on my own." she says.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-03*

"What a coincidence that that should be two Calorian light mages in Trisp at the same time then, assuming the Enera here is the one we are looking for."  Aldus says thinking the situation a little odd, bit not focusing on it too much. "Relations between Calora and Eraia remain poor then? Forgive me, it's been a while since I had the chance to catch up on current events. I trust our respective nation's have remained allies?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-03*

"Oh of course," Afina answered, almost incredulously. _I guess the tribes don't exactly disseminate information about foreign relations well..._ she thought, starting to question how Callora's allies were not aware of their status as such. "Wynne and Callora have been allies for ages, I doubt anything will change that. As for Eraia... well. Callora and Eraia aren't officially on bad terms, it's just been uneasy relations for quite some time now. Many Eraians are probably suspicious of a Callorian princess' visit here, were I not proficient as I am in light magic. The ceasefire they settled all that time ago has been creeping back into foreign relations." She shrugged. "It keeps a princess on her toes."

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-05*

"I'm quite glad at then that, Wynne and Callora have been allies for as long as anyone I know can remember. Although it does seem strange that Eraia is now taking in students from a nation they were borderline crusading in not so long ago doesn't it? An olive branch perhaps? But then why so much secrecy around Enera?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina stands from the bench. "I will say this; The secrecy surrounding another light mage in Trisp is quite suspicious. I, myself, was invited here. But if what you say is true, Enera may very well have been kidnapped from her Calloran family. We must tred lightly in such circumstances." The princess brushed off her travel clothes. "In any case. Let me see what I can find out for you." Afina bowed her head to excuse herself, turning to head for the monastery. _Another thing to put Eraia on Callora's radar..._ she thought.

[end aside]

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

```Location: The Streets of Trisp
Characters: Afina, Nokri
Aside, S T A R T !```

Nokri had been wandering around the streets close to the hotel, getting a feel for the town. Her pockets were stuffed with common ingredients she was hoping to pawn off, but it was doubtful anyone would do business with her. While clean, her clothes were still torn up and she looked rather wild. Taking a rest from her walk, she stood in the shade eyeing the townspeople as they went about their business.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina shook her head as she walked out of the monastery. The Cardinal's behavior would suggest that he was hiding something. He purposely diverted the conversation! But his credibility made Afina want to believe him. Why would he hide another Callorian? _He would certainly hide a kidnapping, Afina you idiot,_ she told herself. Her new travel bag bounced against her side, a heavy light magic book and a few necessities contained inside it. Afina hurried strutted down the roads of the Trisp marketplace, in search of Desii and... what was his NAME!?

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

Nothing too interesting was happening, and Nokri was beginning to attract whispers for loitering. Just as she determined to set off, a familiar face entered the crowd. *Where have I seen her before?* she wondered. The girl looked very busy, striding with purpose towards... somewhere.  After a moment's hesitation, Nokri realized. *It's the royal chick! Mr. Trader's BFF! What is she doing?*
Nokri took a few steps forward. Would the princess appreciate being stopped while she was obviously busy? She's probably so important that she doesn't remember Nokri at all. *Maybe I could help her?* Even if the princess didn't want help, Nokri was dying to know what she was up to. It had to be something grand.

The course of action she decided upon was to swiftly catch up to the princess and wave. If it went well, great! Maybe they could start a conversation! If she received a weird look, Nokri would pretend to be waving to somebody *behind* the princess. It was a foolproof idea. Utterly genius.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina froze as a figure approached from the corner of her eye. _Doesn't a merchant have the good sense to see I look bus--_ Afina thought, turning to admonish the foolish shop vendor. Afina hesitated, and slowed her stride as she recognized the small woman approaching her. _Ah, Nokri. That's Eliran's friend... that Elfriede threatened,_ Afina thought, the secondhand embarrassment making her heart sink. She hoped that dinner had smoothed everything over. Though perhaps if the Drecan was approaching her, then all was well. "Nokri! Hello, what brings you out here to the marketplace?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

It worked! *It worked!* AND she remembered her name!! "Your royal highness, good day!" she greeted courteously. "I merely wanted to express my humble thanks for yesterday's meal. It was truly delicious. I hope I'm not interrupting you from anything too important, you seem busy." Her voice was full of sincerity. "Right now I was just enjoying some fresh air and seeing the sights of this new town. It's been a long time since I enjoyed somewhere as quaint as Trisp. May I ask, what brings you to the market?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina glanced about the market, suddenly every suspicious of every Eraian in the nearest vicinity. "Actually, I was on my way to the park. Would you like to accompany me?" Afina inquired, asking with the familiar soft smile of a courteous princess. _An awful amount of politeness has required today,_ she thought. _Hopefully things with Elfriede will smooth over tonight, even if we don't have any romantic involvements, I could do with some wise input and counsel._ A subtle pink blush blossomed across Afina's cheeks, but she was none the wiser.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

W-w-w-w-would I? Like to accompany her to the park? Now Nokri was the one blushing like a maiden in love. "I would be honored," she managed to say, moving next to Afina so they could continue walking side by side. "Were you just taking a leisurely stroll?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

"Ah, I'm afraid not. I came to Eraia on business, and it seems that business is what this trip shall be about. You see, I came to study light magic. As that is the magic I'm most proficient in." Afina hesitates. "I mean to say, I would study the other magics given the time and access to resources, but light magic is my first and favorite." Afina rolled her eyes playfully. "Laerans are very particular about that type of thing." The two continued down the road, turning onto a side street with much less traffic. "So it seems I've become embroiled in my duty for Callora, as a princess. Desii spoke of a Callorian, Enera, here in Eraia. I have reason to believe shes in the monastery, separated from her parents that miss her. Because your companions informed me of this, though, I'm sure this is information that you are also privy to. Yes?" Afina asked, blue eyes shadowed by flecks of gray as she looked at Nokri. She was serious, without being somber. A type of lighthearted focus that few could carry.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

She nodded along to the story on light magic. This princess must be very religious then. Good to know so Nokri didn't accidentally step on any toes in the future. "How wonderful! I've dabbled in magic myself, but find light magic quite difficult to get the hang of. You must have spent countless hours practicing."
Nokri's expression then faltered, her cordial smile fading into a puzzled neutral expression. The name Enera didn't ring a bell. Is that why they chose to come to this city? Why wasn't she informed?
"Oh yes, of course," she responded to this new information. "How kindhearted of you to be involved with these affairs. Your people must highly cherish you."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina blinked in surprise, a small smile forming across her face. "Why... yes! You know, back home, I'm called the Light of Laera, and everyone is very eager to see their princess take the thro--." Afina paused, remembering the letter from her father that she had received at Elfriede's house. "Well, they are quite anxious for their princess to return home safely. Adamina's Day is a holiday coming up soon actually, it's a day where we reflect on those, especially family, who passed on their knowledge to us." _Though I doubt I'll be spending mine thanking Master Witella_, she thought. "Do excuse me, where are my manners, what magic do you practice, Nokri?" Afina could feel herself relaxing. The Drecan was easy to talk to, and honest. How could such an enthusiastically friendly person come from such a hostile nation?

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

"That sounds so lovely! I would love to witness such a holiday being celebrated, I bet it's a most joyous occasion! Are there festivals, too?" It sounded similar to a Drecan holiday based around filial piety, though without the forced reciting of their national anthem and having to sit still on your knees for hours listening to the history of Dreca. Her legs went numb just recalling it.
"My specialty is healing magic, though I need the right tools. I was a doctor and many times my patients were on the brink of death, so it was important to learn quickly and efficiently to save as many as possible." She left out any mention of dark magic, as an avid worshiper probably wouldn't take too lightly to hearing about sacrifices and gore. "I've been getting rusty though as my companions rely on another to heal them, so if you happen to know anyone who is injured I would appreciate any opportunity to help."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina smiled. "Yes! We have festivals of knowledge and such, called the light festivals. And we have Laera National holidays, celebrating our founder, Archon. He is, of course, the ancestor that my name 'Afina' comes from." Afina cocked her head as Nokri offered healing assistance, genuinely impressed. Afina had been meaning to learn more healing magic, but had never really gotten the time to do so. How had Elfriede threaten someone so kind? Afina made a mental note to reprimand him later. _Adding to the list of things to consult Elfriede about_, she thought. _Right, Elfriede._ Seeing the park approaching, Afina took this opportunity while she had it. Stopping short, Afina quickly bowed her head politely, before raising it to meet Nokri's eyes. "I deeply apologize for the actions of my companion, by the way. He's a little predisposed to mistrusting Drecans on account of his heritage. He is quite the friendly and helpful partner with time, however, so I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive him."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

Nokri nodded in fascination, committing everything Afina told her to memory. It was all very valuable and fascinating information, especially as Nokri barely knew such a country existed in the first place. "Fascinating," and "wow!" were peppered into the conversation several times.
"It is perfectly fine, I don't let such things bother me," she said of the knight incident. "It happens quite often, actually, and I've gotten into a lot of hot water in the past over such misunderstandings. I'm sure he was only acting in his and your best interests. Consider it water under the bridge." How could she continue holding a grudge against the princess's knight? "You two seem like very close companions. You must trust him deeply."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

"Elfriede? Of course, while a queen serves in Laera, she often has a tutor, a counsel, and the support of her loved ones," Afina looked up at the sky as she spoke. "Miraculously, he's been able to perform all three functions, and more. I'm proud to have him by my side, in combat and in peace." Afina's heart fluttered in her chest as she thought about her travels with the knight. "Eraians and Callorians don't typically associate, of course. But... I guess one could say I'm hopeful." Afina turned back towards Nokri. "I don't suppose Eliran has captured your fancy in a similar way, has he?" Afina laughed.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

"How wonderful, to be so close." Nokri flashed an adoring smile. *Maybe one day the princess will think of me the same way.* What a silly, overly hopeful thought. 
She let out a rare, genuine laugh at the mention of Eliran. "Ah, Mr. Playboy? Not in the slightest, I know I don't stand a chance what with his adept ladykilling skills," she joked. 
As they neared the park, Nokri rounded off their chatter, like putting a cherry on top of a sundae. "Thank you for allowing me to accompany you, this was a delightful conversation! I really enjoyed speaking with you."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina smiled. "The same to you! I've had quite the tense day, and I'm glad to have found some pleasant company with you. I look forward to speaking again soon." Afina moved to kiss Nokri's forehead, but remembering her social graces, pulled the young woman into a hug instead. Afina patted her back awkwardly. _Good avoidance, Afina,_ she thought.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-07-09*

Nokri's entire face turned red at the sudden hug. How many years had it been since someone *hugged* her? This princess was totally different from the other nobles, who would just throw money at their problems to live a leisurely life. Was hugging a common custom in Afina's country? Nokri merely responded with "likewise," and bowed humbly, acting as though this was totally normal and not in any way awkward whatsoever.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-07-09*

Afina nodded contently, before turning to face the park. She could see Desii and the laguz man from here. _Darn! I should have asked Nokri what her friends name is,_ Afina thought. Frowning, she began to walk towards the two on the bench. This would be a very interesting conversation.

Getting up to the room goes a lot smoother than expected. Maybe this whole thing would go without a hitch after all. Lt. Faun departs quickly and curtly after Enera opens the door, the crease in his forehead showing stress, weather from annoyance or something more serious he is unsure.

It obvious this encounter is not going to go smoothly after Enera responds to Desii.

“Miss, I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed. I spoke to your parents myself, saw Mirashire not even a month ago. H-how long have you been here exactly?”

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-26*

After watching Elfriede go, Eliran turned and looked at the the young girl, the hurt in her eyes, he pushed the door a little further open, "pardon... but do you mind if we come in? its awkward to talk through a doorway" he asked, trying to keep the mood relaxed.

Desii steps aside slightly, letting Eliran come up next to her. She nods along with Aldus, wishing she had gotten the Kelits to write a message or something.

**Bill** - *2018-07-26*

"..." Enera eyes all of you, surprisingly sharp eyes for a girl age judging every part of the interlopers. She quirks her lip, then motions with her head inside the room. She stays by her chair, hand still resting on many books that adorn her desk. She watches you enter careful, and nods to Desii when the girl motions to close the door. The door swings shut with a quiet click.

"You're effectively telling me... telling me the last 2 years here at this place, which is the only home I've known, is a lie." she says. "That had best... not be a lie." she murmurs, still looking pointedly at Aldus. "Which... is it?"

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-26*

"I'm not lying to you, Enera. What reason would I have for that? What... is the last thing you remember about Mirashire?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-07-26*

Eliran noted the girls hand resting on her tomes, stepping into the room casually before sitting criscrossapplesauce style on the ground, _she's definitely a mage, ready to defend herself already_ he figured. He looked at the girl, feeling sorry for her and added to Aldus's response softly, "she knows deep down its the truth. If Mirashire was destroyed 2 years ago with her being the only survivor, it'd be impossible for us to know she's from there to begin with. The only public knowledge on Enera claims she's an 'Eraian born Light magic genius'.."

**Bill** - *2018-07-26*

Enera frowns at Eliran. "The Cardinal does not state I am *Eraian born*. Please don't make assumptions about what I "know" either." she says defensively. "I'm thirteen, I can think for myself." she says with a slight huff.

"My memory is hazy from before the attack. The town was raised, and Eraian troops traveling nearby came to fend off the raiders... The Cardinal was with them and he nursed me back to health. He calls it *post traumatic stress*". she says, clearly proud of herself for knowing the terminology. 

"When they went back to find my parents, they said nothing was left... It was a blessing the Cardinal took me in to hone my talents." she says, crossing her arms and leaning her tiny frame against the desk. Her eyes drift to one of the drawings on the wall, clearly herself and her parents.

Desii follows the girl's gaze as she wringes the hem of her hip cape in her hands. Nothing here made sense, clearly this is the Enera the Kelits talked so much about! She looks at the drawing as Enera does, mind whirring for a way to show her sincerity to the girl. The black and white drawing fills the young mage's vision, and she imagines Dain and Saila telling her all about their wonderful daughter. Desii bites her lip, trying to run her mind on overdrive.

"It's weird your parents both have dark hair when you have blonde isn't it." Desii says aloud, sinking into a nervous habit of thinking aloud.

**Bill** - *2018-07-26*

Enera blinks and looks at the group of you again. Rather than with the (attempted) harsh edge she use before, her eyes are wide, curious, and glimmering with feeling. 

"How'd... you know that. How'd you know I'm blonde, or I mean, Mama and Papa had darker hair?" she says with tentative excitement, stepping a half step from the desk towards them.

**Aldus (Jess)** - *2018-07-26*

"Because we met them, in Mirashire not to long ago. They are worried sick for you and even though other have given up they still hold onto hope that you will come home, and that you are okay. They love you dearly Enera. You must have memories of them, surley 11 is an age old enough to remember quite a bit?"

**Bill** - *2018-07-26*

"Of course I remember my Mama and Papa!" the girl barks in the entitled way only a child can. "It doesn't make sense though! I want it to, the Cardinal has been very good to me, but he's not... he's not my Papa, and..." she trails off, wrapping her arms around herself. "The Cardinal sent a whole group of mages out. They took *days* to return because they searched every scrap of rubble. If Ma...Mama and Papa are there, why did the mages find them?"

Desii attempts to hide a frown. She takes a big step forward and drops to her knees, hugging the younger girl. 

"It's okay Enera, it's okay. I don't know how this happened, but no one is mad. Everyone will be really happy once you get to go home. You want to go home, don't you?" Desii says softly, rubbing the smaller girl's back. Enera sinks into Desii's shoulder, sniffling despite herself. Desii can feel the nod of agreement. 

Desii gives the girl a moment before placing her hands on her shoulders, pushing back so she can look Enera in the eye. "Then lets go."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

```

Afina and Eliran walked somewhere in the middle of the group; Afina was one of the most at jeopardy if the Cardinal managed to find her. Not only would one girl be in danger, but the international relations of entire kingdoms also hung in the balance. Eliran walked beside her, albeit, at a more labored pace. Afina snuck a glance behind her; Nokri seemed to be trailing just behind her, with Elfriede bringing up the end of the group. Least someone start to fall behind, his strength from years in the military would be able to assist them. It seemed like the knight was about to assist the bard before they had absconded, but under the duress of time, Afina had elected to help instead. She frowned, looking over at Eliran. _Yes, and the oaf had rejected my cape as a disguise._ Afina huddled in closer towards her childhood friend. "We need to talk about some things," she whispered under hushed breath.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

Eliran had begrudgingly taken Afinas aid as he hobbled along on their way out the city. The man would normally have insisted on walking himself but  the imminent threat seemed to be quite humbling. Feeling Afina lean closer and whisper in his ears he raised an eyebrow best he could, "what?" He whispered back. Not forgetting Afinas shoddy state the man was still full of concern

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

If Afina was being honest, there was _much_ to discuss with Eliran. Now that Elfriede had proven untrustworthy, and serendipity had led her to Eliran, the princess had decided to switch to discussing private matters with the Eblian instead. Not to mention... "Something happened in the bishop's office," she whispered. "And not just with the bishop." Her eyes glanced back at knight before returning back to Eliran. "It's becoming increasingly clear to me that some people aren't what-- who they say they are."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

At the mention of the bishop and implied deceit Elirans eyes narrowed, he recalled that she had been taking lessons before, "what happened with the bishop" he asked, a hint of a growl could be heard in his voice. If the church had tried to harm Afina to... well suffice to say a rescue mission wouldnt be the reason Eliran returns next time.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

"The bishop was just like the Cardinal!" She said in a hushed yell. Clearing her throat, Afina lowered her voice once more. "The bishop was convinced that I myself was as divine as their alleged Lylalel. He was demented. And warped." Afina's free hand grazed over her injured left. Her spellcasting hand. "He drugged me, and then broke my hand. It was Elfriede's thinking that saved me from abduction. In all honesty." _And here I had asserted that I could handle combat myself whilst we were at Ransford's station_, she thought, her gaze distant and longing.

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

"Disgusting..." Eliran shook his head, "They like to stand up on a parapet and act holier than thou, but in the end they're all perverted maniacs." He spat to the side, "I should have followed Elfriede when we knew you were late..."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

Afina could feel her stomach drop, and she hesitated, mouth open but unable to force words out. _Elfriede realized that I was late, that's how he managed to save me_, she realized. _He was worried about me_. A warm, fuzzy feeling stirred in Afina's chest and she wanted to hug herself and smile. Recovering her train of thought, however, she blinked away the feeling. "Elfriede is... um..." Afina shifted uncomfortably, sparing only a moment to glance back at the Eraian. He walked purposefully, at attention, hand resting on the pommel of his sword like he always did. Scanning the forest, his eyes met Afina's and she abruptly turned to face forward. Her eyes burned with the threat of tears. "He's not who he says he is either."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

Smacked with a swish of hair as Afina quickly looked away from whatever was behind them, Eliran could hear the hurt in her voice. "What do you mean?" He asked carefully, wanting to be there for the princess, though Eliran already knew that he would be chewing out the knight for lying to her later.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

The princess was starting to feel nauseous again. Whether it was from the residual effects of the drugs, or her mounting anxiety, Afina was unsure. Her free hand wrapped around her torso, holding her stomach. She couldn't say it. Saying it meant that she was convinced of what happened. That there was no denying what Elfriede was. "Do you remember... that time that my family was returning from a festival and our carriage was ambushed?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

Eliran blinked in surprised, he had first heard about the attack from his parents, but it had taken Afina herself a long time to be open details due to the trauma it caused. The fact she was bringing it up now was completely out of left field, "...yeah?" What did it have to do with Elfriede though?

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

Afina pulled up the hood on her cloak, knowing that she could only fight back tears for so long. The Laeran sighed, looking upwards and blinking as she tried to contain her emotions. "Do you recall exactly what it was that attacked my family and I?"

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

"Of course it was-" _laguz_ Eliran realized. He peered over his shoulder at the Knight. The man looked relatively normal, albeit a bit haggard but they all were. "you don't mean he's...?" Eliran let the question hang in the air. _It would explain why he was so tense in the bathhouse.._ He thought to himself, but still to keep that fascade up his whole life through the Eraian military? It was a tough pill to swallow.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-28*

"He _is_," Afina nodded, eyes wide. "No ears, of course. But he's been lying to all of us this whole time." A sudden thought struck Afina. _That must be why... that one night he didn't want to..._ Had Afina not been trying to be discreet, she would have buried her head in shame. She settled for pulling her hood closer around her face. "If he's lying about such a basic fact about himself, then who knows what else he's lying about," she said, a haughty edge in her voice. "Not to mention, he really must not have control of his more... animalistic tendencies. He _killed_ the bishop."

**Halim (Mobiusmelt Cosplay)** - *2018-08-28*

Elirans eyes widened at that statement, _no wonders she lookes like hell... to have the person she was gonna bone suddenly transform in front of her eyes and kill somebody else..._ Eliran gave her a comforting squeeze with his arm that was swung over her shoulder. "its ok... for now we'll be fine... we can deal with this after..." He looked at Afina, then glanced back at Elfriede, "things will work out." They would need to have a discussion.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Afina relaxed just enough as Eliran lightly squeezed her shoulders. "Yes we... we will remedy this," she mumbled, her cheek brushing against the merchant's shoulder. "It seems that the group is heading for Callora. At least we will be able to find safety there. Perhaps the reports of turbulence in Eraia will reach my father. And I shall return home." Afina closed her eyes briefly. She had promised Elfriede that she would help search for Yuria. But such a promise felt like a lifetime ago. Before the circumstances had changed, and the hope of returning home seemed more imminent than ever.

```

Afina didn't know how long they had been walking. It felt like forever. Time dragged on, and yet, there was a constant state of anxiety about the group that the enemy could be gaining on them. Fatigue and fear were quite the mix. Afina herself wasn't even able to practice her light magic while they travelled; such a feat would make them more visible to the enemy. Eliran had sped up to speak with Aldus, leaving Afina alone, walking in silence. Her only possible walking companions were Elfriede, which was clearly not happening, and-- _Ah, Nokri_, Afina realized as the young woman caught up with her. "It's a shame that Eraia has treated you so poorly, Nokri. Your healing skills would be invaluable in the monastery, I would believe," the princess remarked, her voice not quite a whisper.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

Nokri had been stretching her ears, trying to listen in on the princess's conversation without obviously infringing on their privacy. Eliran certainly was buddy buddy with her. Afina treated him like a confidante, spilling all her troubles for him to hear. A pit of jealousy twisted in Nokri's stomach and she shifted the bag she carried in frustration.

Walking like this reminded her of the military. It sucked. It would take forever. So Nokri retreated inside her mind, thinking of what could be done to earn more money in the next stop of wherever their journey would take them. This train of thought came to a screeching halt when she noticed Afina was speaking again. This time, directly to her.

"Oh, p-princess," she sputtered, briefly hiding her face to clear her throat in order to speak properly again. "Thank you for your kind words, but nevermind that. Are you alright? Your system took quite the hit and you immediately bounced back after regaining consciousness. Surely you must be exhausted? Are you thirsty?" Nokri had absolutely nothing that would cure these things at this point in time, but felt that asking anyway made her sound good.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

"Oh! No, I'm quite fine, thank you for asking. I presume my hand will need some tending when we find proper time," Afina said, her left hand cradled to her chest. "Such details such as those can wait, though. Especially as I believe our expected waypoint is... Callora, after all. If I'm not mistaken." Afina absentmindedly straightened the silver emblem that was pinned to her cloak. The night air was becoming cold; Fall was truly upon the traveling party. "Though I must say, I'm not one for Eraia, I think. I thought that the Cardinal was a respectable man, and I learned many of his techniques from my Eraian tutor. But... this is not a land I wish to come back to. Is this how Drecans see such a place?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

Nokri squinted at the princess's hand. Broken? That somehow slipped her previous search. When did it break? "Do we have any cloth? Or gauze, preferably. We should get that wrapped up as soon as possible. It might be awfully painful, I'm sorry. For now try not to move it too much." That last point was probably obvious. The princess would be in immense pain if she even flexed a single joint.

She stiffened for a moment at hearing Dreca. It would be hard to keep on denying being Drecan. Dog boy, Mr. Sleeps-a-lot, or Ditzy probably confided her true nationality to Afina even after Nokri denied the accusation in front of her knight. At this point it probably wasn't worth lying anymore. "Indeed, I was only told Eraia is a horrible place. It looked quaint enough, but the people are said to be ruthless backstabbers. The same could be said for any place, though. What of your homeland?" Her tone suggested she was not insulting the princess's homeland, but merely curious about it.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Afina clicked her tongue, shaking her head. "A shame, really. I've always loved my tutor, but it seems he is just an outlier. A truly upstanding Eraian." Afina's eyebrows raised at the mention of Laera. "Oh? Well Laera is pleasant, there's not much that troubles the small kingdom. Scholars come from all over to refine their knowledge in different fields. It makes Laera quite the inclusive place. Now... that you ask, that's Laera's biggest defining feature, actually. The pursuit of knowledge. Much of the culture revolves around such a commitment. But. Our kingdom came to be from the great Archon Laera, who settled the land in the idea that knowledge could prevent barbaric fighting." Afina stopped for a moment, realizing that Elfriede walked behind the two of them, within earshot. Her more naive nature was starting to get the better of her. "I would say that his outlook is positive, the moral people of Laera do not kill unless it is a last resort. We have some of the lowest frequencies of murder in the Callorian kingdoms," she added, her voice a little louder.

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

Bingo. Afina started spewing like a fountain. The girl was quite fond of her homeland. Nokri nodded along, making the occasional "mmhmm" sounds. She assumed the princess paused to conjure up more facts of Laera, which sounded like an ideal fairy tale. "That is quite wonderful. Other nations could learn from those pacifistic ideals. Your highness is obviously very knowledgeable herself." Nokri thought back to the impressive light show at the monastery. "Are you travelling now for knowledge, then?"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

"Yes! I am. That's the end goal of all Laerans, to be as knowledgeable as possible." Afina felt satisfied as more underhanded insults came to mind, confident that Elfriede was at least casually eavesdropping on the conversation at this point. He deserved to feel hurt, after lying like he did. There was no reason for him to cover up who he was. _Especially with someone he was prepared to be intimate with!_ Afina thought angrily. "Though, most people think that Laerans are simply chasing skills that can be found in books. Such is not the case. My travels are also allowing me to hone my skills as a leader, a friend, a lover, anything really. I hope to gain experience in all facets of life while on this journey."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

Nokri gave her a sideways glance and smirked. "A lover, eh? Sounds like you've had a very fun adventure up until now." She jokingly wiggled her eyebrows. It was a weird sensation and she soon stopped. "It's wonderful that someone of your prestige is willing to undergo all this for the sake of experience. Pray tell, has there been anything difficult for you to learn?" Nokri stopped herself, realizing how insulting that sounded, and followed up with, "I'm sure with your wisdom everything has been a cinch. Everything is probably an open book for you!"

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Afina laughed. Nokri's playful comments were well appreciated in such serious times. "Hardly. Do you know how many times I have nearly died on this voyage? There are far more close encounters than I would like to admit." Afina leaned in closer, exaggerating her motion by pretending to cover her mouth. "And the choice in suitors out here, absolutely dreadful. You would not believe the atrocities if I told you." She giggled again, elated from the subtlest of insults she was able to direct at the Eraian behind them. _Well, in the hopes that he's listening. He better be,_ she thought. "Oh, I wouldn't give myself too much credit," Afina replied, beaming. "In Laera, we believe our ability to learn comes from our parents. My father is king; therefore I have a predisposition to being a good leader and public speaker. So I suppose it only makes sense that combat has been difficult for me. Light magic, no. But only recently have I started using... a..." Afina hesitated, realizing the blue embellished sword was still strapped to her side. Despite Elfriede's faults, he had still been the same patient individual that had stood by her side, demonstrating every sword-fighting technique that she now knew. Such details hadn't changed in the course of events from that night. "Well, Light magic has never been particularly offensive, you see. So. I found it necessary in my travels to arm myself with a sword, and with help, the knowledge of how to use it. Perhaps fire or another anima magic can assist me with such offensive endeavors in the future. How well are you in combat, Nokri?"

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

The princess's laugh and banter was an unexpected surprise. Nokri couldn't help but genuinely giggle herself, unused to such a lighthearted atmosphere. "Oh my. I can only imagine!" A laugh in Dreca was rare and could earn you some lashings in the military. Her smile widened ever so slightly at the mention of 'king.' *Would Afina some day rule the throne?* she wondered. Nokri wanted to ask about the line of succession and whether Afina had any siblings. If someone else was slotted to rule before her, Nokri very much wanted to meet them.

The atmosphere grew tenser, casting aside the playful witticisms. "I know the basics, and enough for self defense." That was essentially the extent of her military training. Nokri left out any mention of traps, toxic gas, and arson. "I can cause some damage with a dagger, but medicines, potions, and drafts are my specialty."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

"Interesting," Afina nodded. "I would very much like to train with you later then, Nokri. I find there's much we could learn from each other. Do you have any interest in light magic? Or perhaps I could teach you about international relations and diplomacy? At home, I have a regular tutor. But in our travels... I find myself lacking in such a department." Afina scratched her head nervously with her free hand. She lowered her voice. "Between you and me, I am quite puzzled as to who my next teacher may be. I'm interested in some skills that aren't exactly common. Alas, hopefully we shall find a skilled teacher whilst voyaging."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

"I've tried my hand at light magic, but it's quite difficult for me. I'm simply not as smart as your highness," she said with a sad smile, taking a deep breath. "It would be my honor to show you what I know! If you have any interest in healing, it may come in handy for the future. Healing and potion-making is really the one thing I can do with pride." With her belief in religion being nonexistent, light magic was unlikely to come to Nokri soon. It was more likely that she should sprout wings and fly. But of course in front of the princess, who was surely religious, Nokri was a prim and proper follower of... *the* church. Whatever church that may be. "Some may call my healing techniques a bit unorthodox, however. In the past it was necessary to heal quickly and with few supplies. Time was of the essence so... improvisation was key." Nokri dwindled off, hesitant to keep talking. "Uncommon skills?" She continued suddenly. "What sort? I find that light magic is already rather uncommon."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

"I..." Afina started. "You may be surprised to hear this. But I'm beginning to feel like light magic really just is not for me anymore. The way the Eraians use it; it's frightening but ineffective. I need something stronger, that truly takes skill to command. I know it's not necessarily illegal but, I believe a slight taboo exists all the same." Afina thought of the dark magic tomes, hidden away in her pack. She lowered her voice to a barely audible whisper. "I want to learn dark magic."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

With a feigned gasp, Nokri looked at the princess. "Really? Perhaps you're also too skilled, and light magic no longer poses a challenge to you? You might get bored in that case." Then things got interesting. Nokri cocked her head to the side, closer to the princess. The confession was exciting, and Nokri took a moment to think if she should dare speak. "For what purpose?" she asked quietly. Dark was the opposite of light. This would prove to be quite the challenge if the princess was serious. "In all honesty..." Nokri nervously continued, "I have given it a try. For research purposes, it was necessary in my previous line of work. Desperate measures, but it showed results. Have you been success with dark magic before?" Nokri inconspicuously glanced at their companions to ensure none were paying attention. Hopefully their attentions were diverted elsewhere.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

"I've never tried it," Afina whispered back, eyes wide with curiosity and fascination. "So I have yet to know whether or not I am able to conjure according to the dark magics. I just..." Afina stared at the ground, brows furrowed. _I shall not let the events of tonight happen again_. "I need to be stronger, is all."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

Worried the princess was getting frustrated, Nokri responded "with your capabilities I'm sure you can do it. I have little magic potential and am able to use the magic to some extent. I would not be surprised if you can master it quickly should you desire it." It would be bad to put the princess in a foul mood, and that would agitate her hand injury. In a regular voice, she asked "how long until we reach our destination? It will be a while, right? If that is the case, perhaps we can do some research along the way. Of course, the sooner we get there the better. It will help to have a roof over our heads again."

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-08-30*

Afina nodded. "Thank you, Nokri, your service to the Tyndall family in teaching me will be much appreciated. Perhaps there is a family crest in it for you, with all these services," she smiled, glancing towards the young woman beside her. "I'm sure we are not far," Afina said, squinted to see Desii and Enera coming to a rest at the top of the hill. "I suppose now we must confer with our companions. We shall talk more on this topic later. Thank you again."

**Nokri (Marisa)** - *2018-08-30*

Nokri stopped dead in her tracks at the mention of a family crest. Her eyes glazed over and she nearly started drooling, but played it off as tripping over a stick in the road. With a slight blush, she replied "the pleasure is all mine, thank you for your time princess."

[ASIDE: END?]
