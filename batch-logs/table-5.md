It was peaceful for a time in the cabin, if the groans of tied up injured men can be called the soundtrack of peaceful. Atalantia had no trouble with the lot of them though it exhausted all the rope she had and could find to restrain them. However nothing stays peaceful forever.

The trapdoor, which had fallen closed when the group rushed out earlier, opens again. Over a dozen men and women arise from the floor, spreading out across the back of the cabin. Each is both calm and armed to the teeth. The final one to rise, a Kissaelain woman with black hair and fur, points her blade at Atalantia.

"You should have left with your friends. Did you think we pulled off all the heists you hunt us for with less than a dozen foolish men?" she says, accompanying her insult with a kick to one of the tied up fools in question. "You have two options, Naissankari. Fight everyone in this room, or come along willingly. As a fellow laguz we'll be fair to you. But the leader wants to meet you, so you're coming with one way... or the other." she says as her eyes narrow. 

Atalantia's keen hearing picks up a thunk against the cabin door behind her, followed by shallow breathing. It's easy for her to realize bandits have come around the other way as well, blocking her escape route.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-14*

Atalantia springs back into a defensive stance upon hearing the trapdoor swing open once more. She chooses to place her hands near her dual blades, so that if she needed to grab them she could in an instant. Atalantia was not prepared to let anyone get the best of her.

Atalantia listens to everything the Kissaelain woman with black hair has to say, and then looks her directly in the eyes. 
"Heh, do you honestly think I would have left with the others? It would be foolish of me to assume that the situation was completely resolved; I suspected that there would be more of you somewhere." Atalantia speaks with a snarky yet firm tone.

Atalantia then relaxes her stance a bit, upon listening to the two options she was provided with. She knew that in this particular moment she would be outnumbered by the bandits surrounding her. There was no doubt that Atalantia could hold her own for a while, but just how many more bandits were waiting for her?
Atalantia chooses to take her chances; she walks slightly towards the Kissaelain woman and states, "I will come along willingly, in order to talk to your leader. Even I know that there is way too many of you against me; there's no way to ensure that my survival is certain in this current situation. All I ask is that you allow me to walk on my own, without anyone man handling me. I would hate to see any more of you get injured."

**Bill** - *2017-12-14*

The kissaelain woman looks at Atalantia for a moment, before leaning back and placing one hand on her hip. "Oh, you're incredibly confident aren't you." she sneers. "Well, so be it. I did not lie when I said we wanted to talk, not fight." she waves her other hand and the outside door opens, a few more bandits coming into the cabin. Some of the ones flanking her head down the trapdoor again and then she motions for you to go ahead of her. 

---

The trap door leads to a variety of wooden passageways and, staircases and ladders. Looking out the windows you can see the shack is actually the tip of a large network of wooden buildings built into the cliffside. It's a rather impressive feat of engineering, though you wonder if was the bandits who put it together in the first place. Each room you pass has some variety of pillaged items in it and if there's enough space some form of sleeping arrangement. As the precession your surrounded by works it's way to close to the cliff's base, you enter into a much larger chamber with tall wooden doors. The room is filled with a large population of bandits, all on the sidelines. As you are lead into the center, the group who brought you down spreads out into the crowd. Bandits line every wall but the far one by the time you reach the center. At the far end of the room is a long table at which a lone tiger laguz sits. 

The apparent leader is small for a tiger laguz but has the muscle tone that is typical of the race. Her hair is a platinum blonde and cut short, her laguz features a darker shade of blonde. A massive battle axes rests behind her against the wall. 

"So." the leader says. "An entire group of my men and women bested by... you? You and a few friends? It speaks poorly of the people I call my own for sure. But it is still deserving of respect. So I ask you, though I shall only once, what is your name? Who might you be and why might you be here?"

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-17*

"Thank you." Atalantia says towards the reasonable kissaelain woman, trying to keep her statements short, simple, and to the point. She was still trying to take in all her surroundings and was not prepared to let her guard down. 

Atalantia stares at her surroundings in awe, as she is escorted through the large network of wooden buildings. Who would have thought that there was this much housing under the deteriorating cabing that she and her teammates had entered earlier. However, this was no laughing matter; depending on the intent of the bandits, the Eraia military may be in a larger predicament then they could ever imagine.

Atalantia takes one step forward, and performs a slight bow of respect for the bandit leader. She wanted to cause no additional trouble than what is necessary, and thought it would be best to show some acknowledgement for the leader's authority.
"My name is Atalantia. I am the Ultimate Alpha of the Uinpeng tribe, which is stationed in the outskirts of Wynne. As my teammates and I traveled, the military near Eraia spoke about a group of bandits attacking and stealing the possessions of nearby townsfolk. While most of my party assumed the worst of your people, I have come to determine why you all have decided to partake in such criminal acts."
Atalantia responded only including what she felt was the most important statements in this current situation. If necessary she would be willing to include more details, but for now she remains patient and ready to defend herself.

**Bill** - *2017-12-18*

"Ha!" the leader exclaims sarcastically. "Well of course you would hear that from those ever groveling dogs." she says with venom in her voice. "Allow me help you in your determinations Atalantia, *ultimate alpha* of the Uinpeng tribe." she stands, raising her arms in an open gesture. 

"We are those who could no longer live with the garbage we put up with in the human controlled lands. The Kissaelain territories are gone, taken by Drecia in their petty war. We had no where to go but north, less we be enslaved or worse by the dragon rider scum. With nothing but the clothes on our backs we came to Eraia, to Theanovene, to Callora for aid. What did we get?"

"Almost as much abuse as the damn dragon riders would have done." she spits. "Were we human refugees we'd surely have been given everything we needed, at least enough that we didn't have to *steal to survive*. And yet there we were, living on streets and cheating, lying and stealing just to live in the cities of man. Well..." she drops off. She leans over the table in your direction.

"If they were going to give us aid at all, they would have done so. If we're going to have to take the aid we need for ourselves... we might as well take heartily." she says with a sneer. 

"Surely, as a proud wolf, you must understand this plight. The humans of the world destroy our home then refuse to take responsibility. Are we not justified? Do we not do onto them as has been done to us? Do we not take from their home since they took ours from us?" she calls. Her men acknowledge her various ways, nods and raised fists. Not a one speaks up though, leaving the leader looking directly at you to answer her question.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-21*

Atalantia stood in awe, after listening to the Kissaelain bandit leader explain the reasoning behind the criminal acts.
Since the beginning, Atalantia knew that there must have been some reasoning behind the bandits' actions. However, was all of this information true? And if it is true, does the torment that these laguz people have endured justify their crimes against the humans?

Atalantia took a moment to reflect on her own life, especially her experience with her tribe. She too could recall many times in which the humans have harmed her family and people, although nothing was as extreme as this leader was presenting. Perhaps the most harsh encounter Atalantia faced with the humans directly was when her sibblings were slaughtered; their deaths did provoke some negativity towards the humans, and could build up into some vengeance seeking tendencies.

After reflecting, Atalantia finally chose to speak:
"During my days leading my tribe, we too encountered plenty of the humans' destruction. In fact, the humans murdered my two youngest sibblings in the most brutal of ways. So trust me, I understand the plight you all are enduring and why you hate the humans.
However, despite all this pain, is it not best to learn to better yourselves as people? By committing crimes against the humans, you aren't just seeking revenge for the sins against your people, but you are becoming monsters as well....."

Atalantia understood that her last statement would probably come back to bite her, but she stuck to her gut and said what had to be said.

**Bill** - *2017-12-21*

The leader scowls at the term monster. "We do not commit crimes for *revenge* girl. We do what we have to survive. Survival of the fittest is nature's law and it's by that we live. You may have had what you needed to survive in your cushy *ultimate alpha* job, but the rest of us need to fight our way up the food chain." she says tersely.

"Did you truly understand our plight, you would surely agree with us. Not call us the monsters." she says, looking off to the side. She turns back to you with a sneer. "Then again, you travel with the true monsters. Maybe you've just been indoctrinated. Are you just a pet for those humans who left you here?" At her insult the entire room laughs and jeers. After a good moment of laughter the bandit leader raises her hand and the room quiets. She's still smiling.

"We'll be happy to help you remove that collar you know. Join us and we'll show you what it means to be free, to live. Or..." the leader reaches behind her and lifts the massive axe onto her her shoulder. "We'll beat that attitude out of you. Maybe ransom you back to your friends. An Eraian knight has to have coin." she says with a shrug.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2017-12-27*

"Ha, me, indoctrinated by the humans? Surely you don't expect that I agree with  the actions and attitudes of the humans, do you? 
I have faced their discrimination against the laguz people first hand and while this does infuriate me, I understand that they may not understand the world from our perspective and that we must help teach them about our culture respectfully. 
Perhaps, it would be better to try and teach them our morals and ideology in a civilized manner instead of committing crimes against the humans. 

Forgive me,  but I never meant to suggest that you all were monsters. However it appears that you all are helping to portray the animalistic behaviors that the humans think the Laguz have. 

I would love to work with you all if you want to teach the humans the true nature of the laguz, but i will refuse to allow you all to represent the whole Laguz population by committing the crimes that you have. If we are to demonstrate that we are better than the humans, we must do so without causing harm and destruction. Only then, will the humans truly appreciate our species, and no longer cause prejudice and crimes against us." 
Atalantia responds slightly becoming infuriated by the navie thinking that the bandits seem to have.

**Bill** - *2017-12-28*

The leader's brows furrow as Atalantia replies. 

"You speak that you act for the good of the laguz, and that you know the discrimination we faced. Yet you talk like a foolish girl whose never suffered a day without food because no establishment will allow you in. A foolish girl whose never been beaten for asking for *help*. Another indoctrinated whelp." She shakes her head. 

"I see potential in you, the potential to see the world as it really is. But..." She turns around, grabbing the massive axe behind her and resting the hilt on her shoulder. "It appears we have to do this the hard way." She nods and the sound of metal weapons being drawn resounds throughout the hall while many men shout "Yes Rica!". The bandits wrap the circle completely, surrounding Atalantia and closing inward. Rica stands as she was, watching Atalantia with narrowed eyes.

(ooc: The side goal refers to breaking out of the bandit's circle allowing you access to the walls of the room, the door out, or Rica. Rica is abstaining from joining the dog pile at this time and it's obvious. This is a very high stake fight, where you can earn 8 dice to roll in a single round. You've got a lot of dice to earn and and a lot of enemies you can slice through. Go ham, you'll want every die you can get.)

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-01*

Atalantia truly becomes filled with rage at Rica's accusations. 
Rica truly had no clue who she was talking to, nor of the struggles Atalantia and her tribe had gone through. 
There were plenty of winter's where Atalantia and her tribe would go days without eating food due to the hibernation and migration of many of the creatures they would hunt. Many of these animals also fled the wynne outskirts due to the pollution the humans were creating through their production of useless weaponry.

The humans also frequently ambushed Atalantia's tribe's campsite during their travels, or when they were testing new weaponry. Overall,Atalantia's tribe faced a fair share of the humans ignorant and selfish acts against her people. However, despite such struggles, never once did her tribe seek to inflict pain on the humans. Instead her people accepted their suffering, and continued to push forward. They knew that criminal acts against the humans would prove nothing, and would perhaps endanger and cause more discrimination against the tribe.

Atalantia knew that there was no longer the option of negotiating with the bandits; they were set in their criminal ways due to their devoted acceptance of their leader, Rica. Perhaps if Atalantia were to impair the bandits surrounding her, and vanguish Rica, they would acknowledge that their criminal acts were wrong.

Without hesitation Atalantia begins a flurry of slashes focusing her attention on the circle of bandits surrounding her. 
Atalantia was still strongly against murdering these Laguz people. While their actions have been merciless and criminal, Atalantia did not want to become a monster herself.

Atalantia first looks towards the tallest white tiger laguz bandit in the circle. This bandit was holding a giant bastard sword, which seemed like it would be capable of doing a lot of damage. To handle this bandit, atalantia slashed the grasping tendons so that they could no longer hold the bastard sword and would have to rely on their rigid hand to hand combat skills. 

Atalantia then rushes towards a smaller orange tiger laguz, who was holding dual blades like she was. Knowing that dual blades require a lot of finesse and fast movement on the feet. In order to handle this orange tiger laguz, atalantia slashed the Achilles tendon so that their movement would be impaired. Hopefully slashing this tendon would make the orange tiger laguz fall to the ground unable to move in general.

Atalantia then turns around and braces into a defensive stance so that she would have enough endurance to withstand the fight.

**Bill** - *2018-01-03*

The bandits swarm around the Naissankari woman. Steel in every shape and size pounds against her guard. While Rica's orders seemed to imply a non lethal take down these men and women are bloodthirsty in their swings. Behind the first wave of warriors Atalantia can spot a half dozen kissaelain tigers transforming into their beast form, growls reverberating in their throats.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-04*

While standing in her defensive stance, Atalantia notices the wave of bandits dashing towards her. A few meters behind that wave was the group of tiger form laguz; Atalantia thought to herself *Hmm I guess these laguz people aren't afraid to use their animal forms either, and may use them freely. I suppose this would not be an adequate time to change into my wolf form though...*

Atalantia ears prop up to the sound of Rica yelling at her men from across the room. In a frustrated tone, Rica informs her men that, “The girl cannot escape unscathed, be sure to corner her and take her down!!!!”
Atalantia knew that this meant trouble. She could not just remain in her current space, otherwise the bandits would surely succeed in cornering her. In effort to avoid such conflict, Atalantia puts her dual blades away and waits until the first wave of bandits come closer, she then and jumps forward and flips over the bandit in the center of the first wave, drawing out her dual blades again and takes a chance at slashing the center bandit’s shoulder blades. Her slash causes the bandit to drop his weapons unable to move his arms.

Once gaining a position in the center of the line, Atalantia waits until the two large white tiger bandits of the line start to take a swing at her with their giant hammers. Right before the hammers are about to hit, Atalantia drops to the ground keeping her knees bent, causing both of the men to hit each other. Their strong hammer swings knock each other out. Once these two men fall to the ground, Atalantia springs back up in order to continue the fight.

By this point the second wave of tiger form laguz were encroaching on her position. Atalantia knew that she had to take care of the first wave immediately. In order to finish off the bandits from the first wave, she takes bold chance to throw both of her dual blades at the last two bandits. The blade aimed towards the bandit wearing shiny gold earrings his him directly in the sternum and the other lands directly in the other bandit’s eye! Atalantia winces as she did not intend for those to be fatal blows but there is no time for that at the moment. Atalantia takes hold of her blades again and pulls it out of the earring bandits’ skull and rushes over to the blade embedded in the other bandit’s torso.

As Atalantia grabs her second blade, she is knocked prone as a tiger bandit manages to pounce on top of her. “Damn, I wasn’t fast enough.” The pressure of this large mammal’s weight on her shoulders has Atalantia starting to feel a bit exhausted, but this was no time to slow down. Atalantia manages to pull back her legs and push with all her might on the tiger’s stomach...with no result. Atalantia sees the other tiger form laguz walking over chuckling at the trapped puppy. Atalantia fills with rage, “To laugh at your own kind!” With the arm that had retrieved the first sword she pulls the blade across the vulnerable area of the tiger’s belly and rips across. The tiger rears off of Atalantia in pain moments before falling backwards, lifeless in a growing pool of blood.

The other tigers hesitate for a moment upon seeing this, but know they have this girl outmatched they resume their approach. Their hesitation did give Atalantia enough time to regain her stance and second weapon.

Atalantia rushes towards the remaining five tiger form bandits, who were also attempting to harm her. The first of these tigers widens its mouth in attempt to bite Atalantia on the arm, in hopes to impair her fighting ability. Atalantia notices this, and reacts by swinging her blades in between the tiger’s mouth causing it’s jaw to be dislocated and mauled. 
A second tiger attempts to pounce on top of Atalantia in order to restrain her, and brings its front two legs upward. However, right before falling down on to Atalantia, Atalantia positions her blades upwards and manages to slash in between its chest.
Next, two of the remaining three tigers decide to team up against Atalantia after becoming slightly afraid of the madwoman standing before them. The two tigers aim for Atalantia’s legs, but Atalantia reacts by jumping in the air and thrusting her two blades through their skulls. 
The final tiger of the group seemed quite fearful of it life, and chose to run towards Rica. However, Atalantia was not allowing this bandit to get away. As the last tiger runs away, Atalantia runs towards it and lunges on top of its back. She then takes the base of her blades and starts to strangle the last tiger. While the tiger squirms for air, Atalantia begins to calm herself down a bit from her rage, and notices that she has perhaps taken this a bit far. Instead of killing the last tiger bandit, she suffocates him until he falls unconscious. Hopefully no more enemies will have to fall today…. 

Atalantia steps away from the limp bodies of the bandits she had either killed or left immobile. She was thoroughly exhausted by this point, but still had a job to finish. Atalantia wipes some sweat off her forehead, smearing some of the blood of her enemies on her face. She then points one of her dual blades at the circle of bandits and Rica and yells, “So who’s next,” in attempt to scatter the remaining bandits.

**Bill** - *2018-01-04*

The collected men and woman of Rica's bandits all have similar expressions. Partially shocked at the violence Atalantia has displayed, partially enraged at the deaths of their comrades and friends. There's a beat where no one moves, everyone watching the bloody Naissankari taunt them. Finally one cat laguz leads the charge with a tear in his eye, and the entire crowd moves as one with him, blades, clubs, claws, and fangs at the ready.

_-_-_

The double doors open to bodies, dozens of them. Slash and stabbing wounds leave men injured and dead alike in front of Ransford, Elfriede and Afina. Bloody lines fallen from blood drenched blades line the floors, all leading to the center of the room where Atalantia stands, bloodied and battling a room full of bandits. The trail of destruction behind her gives you a vague idea of whose blood it is that saturates her clothes and blades. Across the otherwise unfurnished room on a raised platform is a tiger laguz woman with a massive axe on her shoulder. She looks over to your group and looks away dismissively. Some of the men, the one approaching Atalantia from the back, turn around and sprint towards your group as well. 

Ransford whistles.

(Ooc: with the side goal clear you are now free to move anywhere you like in the room, that goes for everyone. Rica has still not engaged.)

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-04*

Atalantia remains standing in the center of the room unphased by  the bandits’ choice to rush towards her. She knew that they would be filled with several emotions after witnessing the destruction she has caused; any normal individual would react as such. Despite the reality of the situation, Atalantia did slightly hope that her violent actions would have convinced the bandits to stop their foolish attacks so that she would no longer have to participate in this harsh battle.

Atalantia's ears immediately prop up to the sound of the double doors opening behind her.
 *More of them?* she automatically assumes due to the nature of the battle, and she takes a quick glance to check. Atalantia’s eyes tear up slightly to the idea the sight of her comrades slowly entering the scene of the battle. She was quite surprised that her comrades have actually shown up to rejoin Atalantia at this hideout; she was convinced that her comrades still did not trust nor appreciate her for being a laguz wolf. However, even though Atalantia wished with all her might that this could be a peaceful and joyous reuniting with her friends, this was no time for formalities. Atalantia had a job to finish.

Atalantia face rapidly changes from one of being teary eye and joyous, to one that is stern. She then looks towards Rica to observe whether or not her actions in this battle had been updated. Atalantia observes Rica just standing pretty on her platform, as if she was a god; Rica apparently did not wish to get her hands dirty, and displayed no amount of sadness for her dying men in front of her.
 Atalantia becomes infuriated by this picture….*How could a leader be so selfish as to wish for their survival and protection alone? A leader must be there to guide their men, but also set an example to live by. By not participating in this battle, Rica is definitely not a leader… instead she must be a coward of the worst extent*

Filled with rage, Atalantia decides that she must end Rica’s foolish decision to remain low as her men become vanquished. Atalantia steps forward one step at a time, grasping on to her dual blades, ready to slash down anyone who got in her way. As she suspected, bandits did try to block her from gaining ground towards Rica; in response Atalantia just slashed the men without hesitation, causing them to fall to the ground bleeding and wailing in pain. As Atalantia sliced about half a dozen men, her face remain unchanged and her eyes remained focused on Rica.

Finally, Atalantia approached the platform Rica was standing on. She points her blades at Rica, who Atalantia notices is looking at her as if she was a foolish little puppy. 
“I believe I owe you a fight. You are no leader, you are a coward… a sadist… who takes pleasure in watching her men die. Now you must pay the consequences!” Atalantia exclaims towards Rica.

“What makes you so special that you think you can stand above everyone else?” Atalantia then states towards Rica, jumping onto the same leveled platform as Rica. “Now we can rightfully determine who is more worthy to be up here,” Atalantia states as she swings both of her dual blades, landing a direct blow on the left and right side of Rica.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-05*

Afina covered her mouth in horror. Bodies and blood littered the floor, strewn about and slashed open like they had been attacked by an _animal_. She resisted the urge to fearfully grab one of the soldiers by the arm, unable to avert her eyes from the crimson splattered across the room. Glancing about, Afina’s sight landed on Atalantia, who stood in the center of the room hacking and slicing. The princess put together the two facts, realizing it was Atalantia herself that had done this damage. Atalantia… was the animal. 

At the sound of the doors opening, Atalantia had spared just a moment to glance their way. For a split second, it felt like they had made eye contact; Ataltantia’s bright gray eyes were filled with vibrant determination, and Afina didn’t have the time to hide her horror at the scene in front of her. A shiver ran up her spine. There didn’t seem to be an ounce of remorse in Atalantia’s eyes. Maybe this was how the tribal laguz fought.

While relieved to have recovered their lost party member, Afina found herself distracted by the blood. On the floor, on the walls, on _Atalantia herself_. She opened her palm to direct a column of light at the laguz, and the beam itself flickered and fizzled, many of the bandits still standing after getting caught in its blast. Afina’s chest felt tight, and she took a step back from the fight. This scene felt too familiar. The sticky and humid texture of the blood that covered the floor, coagulating on the underside of Afina’s boots. The heavy, metallic scent in the air, that the princess almost dared not to breathe. The needless violence, that fed into more gruesome, terrible violence. Afina shook off the fear, focusing on projecting a new ball of light. Maybe if she could just calibrate it so that it purified a higher quantity laguz, she would have a better chance at incapacitating a bandit. 

Instantaneously, the remaining soldiers charged forward at Ransford’s command, the shoulder of one knight catching on Afina’s. She stumbled forward, hands and knees meeting the bloody floor with a dull thunk. The knight paused, apologizing profusely, and offered a hand to the princess. Afina pushed it aside, wiping her hands on her cloak before pulling herself up.

Afina brushed herself off, and watched as Atalantia ascended the platform to be eye level with one laguz woman, who they could rightly assume was the leader of these forces. A battle axe so needlessly huge was only a weapon wielded by an idiot or a leader. Afina pursed her lips. Or both, she thought. 

Afina flipped her book to a new page, smoothing it out with her hand. She took a deep breath, trying to push the violent imagery out of her mind. If she could just take down the last few bandits with a scatter shot of light. Afina pointed her palm at the bandits, gritting her teeth to focus, she began the spell, body still tense with a mix of anger and fear. As she read, a ball of light condensed in front of her, suspended in the air by her words. Abruptly, it shot forward like cannonball, breaking into smaller fragments that exploded in all directions.

Afina’s eyes wandered to Atalantia up on the platform with the bandit leader, and the light abruptly fizzled out before it could reach any of the bandit forces. She cursed, calling much of the room “dumb” and balling up her hand into a fist. With a grunt, Afina angrily refocused, and a bright white circle appeared on the floor of the room, encircling bandits and soldiers alike. A small voice fought against the action in the back of her mind. The spell’s radius was too big. Afina didn’t have complete control of the spell as it was. Afina could injure soldier’s in her angry haze. And yet, the princess opened her mouth to recite the spell.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-05*

Elfriede followed Ransford closely with Afina in tow as he opened the double doors. His eyes first locked with the lone figure in the center, Atalantia. It did his heart good to see her okay, if not coated in blood. He smiled softly but then dropped the visage as he scanned the large room. The scene was gory devastation, although not the first time he’d seen so many dead. 

Faun’s drew his weapons while his breathing suddenly sped up as he took the carnage in. It was impressive that she had been able to hold her own against so many with minor injuries. Suddenly Ransfords men began to move forward, so the boy began to walk around the flank as he had done in the last battle. He saw a beam of dim light crackle passed him and he stopped in his tracks to glance back at Afina. She had *fallen*? She was on her hands and knees in a puddle of blood, mouth agape and disgusted at the grotesque life fluid. He froze as he watched her visible tremble a bit, then scramble to her feet brushing streaks of red across her tunic as she tried to get it off of her hands. Elfriede stared for a brief moment at her, in that moment she looked like a scared child; he desperately wanted to console her on this, but this just wasn’t the time. 

Despite his instincts he winced and turned away to face the battle scene ahead. Ransfords soldiers had swiftly engaged many of the remaining mooks with some moving to flank, while Atalantia slowly approached the lone demi-god figure that stood watching the battle unfold. The tall Lagu warrior from the north clearly could handle herself, so he paused for a brief moment considering if he should just stay and guard Afina so they didn't have a repeat of last time, but that would be a huge waste of his skill set. At the very least he should engage the ones looking to flank and attack the princess or Ransford from behind. Once that was clear, they’d deal with the boss woman. Elfriede suddenly cut left and behind the soldier wall.

“Alright.” Elfriede breath steadied and he slipped into his practiced stance just as two laguz skidded around to the right of the soldiers. One of them slid on the blood that ran freely from the bodies and stumbled toward Elfriede. 

“You’re joking right? Elfriede sidestepped and pommel-striked the fool hardy laguz knocking him out cold. The other stepped forward twirling nothing but a chain with no flail on its end. The bandit swung hard at Elfriede and the chain met with his dagger. Fortune didn’t smile of him at that moment as the chain wrapped tightly around his arm pitting his strength against the bandits. In a battle of pure strength Elfriede was going to lose. Luckily Faun still had a weapon in his other hand and had other skills. He briefly tugged backwards on the chain and ran up the bandits body into a backflip, pulling the chain wielding arm outwards to hold on to him. His rapier came down stabbing into the bandits forearm causing him to let go.

Faun shook off the chain as he landed and went to engage again when he saw a dim white light all around the bulk of the enemies on the floor.

**Bill** - *2018-01-08*

Rica hops back from Atalantia's slashes, ignoring them as if they were only paper cuts. She gives her arms a glance before turning back to Atalantia. Rica raises an eyebrow at the woman, no girl in front of her. A speech about what it means to be a leader? *She certainly does not speak from experience*, the Kissaelain woman muses as the axe drops from her shoulder to a ready position.

"You'd be better off defending yourself than theorizing on if I am leader or I am a coward girl." Rica says. There's no malice to her voice, the woman has none of the firey passion her opponent shows. Instead she is calm, focused. Rica steps in with a rising diagonal swing of her axe, cutting the Naissankari's leg. As the axe comes over Rica's head she loosens her grip on the haft, the axe sliding down in her hands. Holding the axe half up the handle she drops the blade down in a crushing blow at Atalantia's shoulder. The axe flips upward as it hit's the ground, Rica's hand sliding back to the handle of the axe's hilt creating a strange Yoyo effect where the closer axe extends outward as she swings it up. It builds a bit of space between the two women. Rica takes her axe in two hands, holding it cross body such that she can defend herself with the haft.

Ransford grimaces. With a hurried step he jogs into the fray, knocking one approaching laguz in the head with his shield rather than actually fight him. He gets to the center of the room before he's stopped by the flow of combat, three laguz clearly in his way to the bandit leader and the wolf girl.

The left bandit, a tabby cat laguz, is the first to rush Ransford with his short sword. Ransford raises his shield to block and the laguz's blade bounces off the shield. Rather than raise his own blade Ransford steps forward with his shield, pummeling the Kissaelain right in the nose with his shield. The laguz collapses to the floor just as the right laguz, a blonde tiger this time, leaps at Ransford in tiger form. The cat's weight knocks Ransford down, Ransford is unable to interpose his shield between the tiger and himself. 

Before the cat can sink it's fangs into his windpipe Ransford flicks his wrist and thrusts his blade into the tiger's stomach. Ransford rolls, ending up on top of the impaled tiger. Ransford shares a look with the tiger before standing up and facing the last man. The final laguz in Ransford's way has an axe nearly the size of Rica's and swings it in a mad overhead slash at Ransford. The man looks to dodge to his right, but hesitates after looking at the tiger below him. Ransford crouches and raises his shield using his sword arms as another support as the axe head slams into the Commander's shield. The slam reverberates through the whole room, louder than a gong. Ransford thrusts upward from his crouch, stabbing the axe wielder in the arm. The axe clatters to the floor and the laguz step backward. Ransford stands and slashes across his legs and the crossing his body. The cut is deep and the laguz falls to the ground in pain. Ransford hefts his shield and steps over the three.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-08*

As Afina read, the floor began to glow with a brilliant white light. Bandits paused, confused at the sudden luminosity of the blood-stained floor. Their reactions did not register to Afina as she read, fueled by anger. She wanted to see every bandit vanquished so that she didn’t have to stand in that _filthy_ room of barbaric savages any longer. She had materialized the light on the floor; the next step was the column of light. She imagined the soaring beam enveloping every laguz bandit in the room, leaving them as pained heaps on the floor. Afina read with extreme prejudice, her eyes flashing with anger. 

The loud clang of metal striking metal broke her concentration, and in an instant, the spell misfired. 

Instead of enveloping the room in a curtain of light, the floor flashed with a brilliance that blinded all facing it. Afina herself dropped her book to shield her eyes. As the light faded, the room returned to its regular flurry of fighting, and the princess stared at the fallen book, dumbfounded. She felt like she was young again, training with her tutor. She had not failed a spell in a long time, and out of habit, she braced herself for a reprimand. Realizing no admonishment was forthcoming, Afina exhaled, tucking her hair behind her ear and stooping to pick up her book. She was the most gifted light mage of her age, and this behavior was very unbecoming of her. Not to mention, without light magic, she was proving to be very useless in combat.

Afina took a deep breath to realign her focus. By now, most of the bandits had been placed out of commission by her comrades. She watched as Ransford disposed of any bandits who dared to attack him. Atalantia was holding her own against the bandit leader, whose calm demeanor directly contrasted the wolf laguz’s firey one. Elfriede had defeated all the enemies that challenged him, sparing only a couple moments to assess his companions before making his way towards Atalantia. 

Afina realigned her focus, realizing that bolstering her companions would do more good than wildly attacking bandits. The generic ball of light spell was basic, but versatile and effective when used correctly. Perhaps the more advanced spell wasn’t always the more appropriate. A rogue bandit charged at Elfriede, and Afina conjured a ball of light _within_ the bandits body, searing him from the inside out. The bandit clutched his chest, falling to his knees and dropping his weapons. 

Gaining confidence, Afina directed her attention towards a bandit on the floor, who seemed like she might rise to attack Ransford. A popping ball of light exploded in her face, and the laguz woman threw her arms up to hold her agonizing visage. Afina’s eyes seemed brighter as she continued to cast, disposing of bandits that had failed to notice her. Finally, Afina fixed her spell on the laguz leader fighting Atalantia. A small disk of light appeared on the floor, encircling the woman’s feet. Let’s try this again, Afina thought.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-09*

Suddenly, groups of bandits all engaged Elfriede. Many resounding parries were heard. Metal on metal ringing throughout the compound. Elfriede's feet shifted left and right, side stepping the numerous weapons while leaving stinging stab wounds all over the enemies. This was the flow of combat; this was the riposte fighting style.

Laguz after laguz stepped forward and was beaten back by flurries of stabs and minor slashes, many weapons fell to the ground under the agility and dexterity of Elfriede Faun. Elfriede ducked under the might of a swing from a Warhammer wielding bandit and went to arm throw him when suddenly a flash of light encompassed the room throwing him off balance. Faun backed up and straightened his posture to reassess. He glanced a confused glare over at Afina, she looked to be uneasy but steadying herself. Unless the laguz got ahold of their own personal light mage, it was probably *his* own personal light mage. He wouldn't hold it against her though, she looked like she had a lot on her mind. At least no one was actively engaging her.

His concentration broke when a bandit approaching from behind was pegged with glowing light. “*Looks like she got it together.*” 

The last mook in the group ran at Elfriede and this time he ducked low, stabbed down into it's knee and shoulder threw it onto the growing pile of mooks.

Elfriede then made a break passed Ransford up toward Atalantia through the thinning sea of enemies, taking a few engaging Ransford down a notch as his passed with quick blows to the back of the legs.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-11*

Atalantia stumbles forward as both of her blades fail to hit Rica; she is slightly taken back by the idea that Rica can stand her ground and may in fact have more combat skills than Atalantia originally assumed. Shortly after this acknowledgement, Rica makes her statement towards Atalantia about needing to defend herself rather than theorize about whether Rica is a coward or a leader. This wisecrack statement fills Atalantia with Rage and she yells, “Don’t you dare tell me what to do.” As she says this, Atalantia loses her concentration for a moment allowing Rica to land a direct hit onto her shoulder. This hit manages to dislocate Atalantia’s shoulder, and shue mutters “Shoot, that’s not good” under her breath, as she falls to the ground. Atalantia becomes quite disappointed in her failure to maintain concentration, and for allowing herself to become injured.
------------
Upon hitting the ground, Atalantia closes her eyes and takes a brief moment to recognize that perhaps there are plenty of people stronger than her in this world and that she might have a lot more to learn about combat than she previously thought. Despite this negative thought, Atalantia refused to sulk at the idea that she was weaker than she had thought. To counteract the negativity, Atalantia rapidly became filled with the fiery conviction to prove herself wrong; Rica would not get the best of her and no one would stop her from winning this fight. Atalantia slowly rises from the ground taking hold of her dislocated shoulder; her fiery eyes stare directly into Rica’s almost as if she was peering into her soul. As she rises, she makes sure to harshly push onto her shoulder until it pops back into the socket. While pushing her dislocated shoulder back into place, Atalantia first starts to yelp in pain, but the yells slowly begins transform from the sound of pain to that of a warrior’s battle cry.

After this process, Atalantia’s attention goes towards the faint glow of light encircling Rica’s feet; *”This must be Afina’s doing…. Thank you…”* Atalantia thinks to herself as she witnesses this sight, which may prove beneficial towards winning the battle.

Atalantia then directs her attention towards Elfriede who seems to be valiantly slaying bandits in order to assist her with fighting Rica. While Atalantia did know that allowing others to assist her in this fight would be most beneficial, she was too stubborn to allow it. Atalantia wanted so badly to prove to herself that she was strong enough to vanquish Rica on her own. After all, she had survived this long without help from others.
Atalantia then grabs on to both of her dual blades and menacingly starts to walk towards Rica. As she does this, she yells towards Elfirede, “Elfriede this is my fight! I thank you for your help, but I must do this one on my own. If you could, please watch my back and protect me from the bandits, and please make sure that everyone else is safe before myself.”

Atalantia then darts towards Rica, holding her blades out in front of her as if she was going to strike Rica’s ribs. However, Atalantia was not so foolish as to think this approach would work. Instead, she slides under Rica’s legs and takes a stab at Rica’s back in between both of Rica’s shoulder blades. *”Let’s see how you like a shoulder injury”* Atalantia thinks in a sassy tone. Atalantia’s blades scrape against Rica’s shoulder blades, managing to pierce into them slightly, but no devastating damage was achieved. Atalantia had underestimated the amount of pain she would feel in her previously dislocated shoulder, and could not follow through completely with her strike. Atalantia jumps in place for a moment attempting to shake off the pain from her shoulder injury. She then runs towards Rica yet again, attempting an attack at Rica’s chest; Rica manages to defend herself creating a parry. Both of Atalantia’s blades hit against Rica’s axe creating a loud clang noise, similar to that of a gong being hit in an orchestra. Atalantia then jumps backward and runs towards Rica once again, but this time Atalantia squats down in order to dodge any of Rica’s potential attacks. She then springs up and manages to angle herself onto the side of RIca, and take a stab at one of Rica’s elbows. The strike to Rica’s elbow barely hits, but still manages to scratch it and cause some bleeding; hopefully this elbow injury would be major enough to prohibit Rica from following through with any major axe attacks.

**Bill** - *2018-01-11*

Rica's face contorts slightly at the cut to her arm but that seems to be the only effect. She whips forward with her axe in two hands, stepping forward in a lunge as her swing turns into a spin. It's an easily telegraphed swing but puts space between the women. At the end of her spin Rica angles the axe upward, the heavy weapon launching into the air as she releases her hold on the hilt. Following the axe blade in the air is the true mistake. A massive tigress leaps up after it, grabbing the hilt out of the air in it's fangs. A paw reaches up as well and between the tigress's fangs and paw the axe blade comes swinging down towards Atalantia's head. 

Between Atalantia's own talents and the accuracy of a tiger diving bombing with an axe the axe blade can do no more than slice Atalantia's chest and arm before it veers off course. In the blink of an eye Rica transforms again, swinging her axe in a counter clockwise slash around her back and right for Atalantia's gut. At the last moment, she rotates the weapon so the flat of the double axe smashes into Atalantia, sending her flying into the center of the room in a tumble.

Rica swings the axe up to her shoulder and cracks her neck as she looks over her cowering and defeated laguz. "You damn fools. You came to me for strength, for pride and for a chance to take what was yours. Now a handful of men and women, hell, that one there looks like a bloody school girl, and you fall at their feet? Where is your passion? These are the humans that took *everything* from us. Our homes, our friends, our *families*! Half of you came to me with tears of rage in your eyes, looking to right the wrongs you've suffered! Where is that passion? Where is your pride as laguz, Your pride in your nature? That is where your strength lies gentleman, and I'd appreciate you showing our fine guests just what that power is. Show them just what we *beasts are capable of*."

The men and woman who can still stand rise. Those who can't begin to shift forms. The room is eerily quiet as soon dozens of cats and tigers fill the room. The few men left from Ransford's squad come together back to back, surrounded by a veritable pack of Kissaelain warriors. They're tired and bloodied already, yet they ready their blades through pained breaths. Ransford looks back at them.

"We should leave. No telling when the rest will get down here. That whole group can't chase us down the hallway." he says quietly. There's an edge to his voice, not of fear but of cold calculus. "I don't see that happening though." Ransford back up past Elfriede and Afina before turning around to his men. "I'll hold this line as long as possible. You cut her down, these beasts will back down too." Ransford says before standing shoulder to shoulder with his handful of loyal troops. With a glance over your shoulder, you can see his men straighten at their Commander's approach. It is not a speech Ransford gives to raise his men's spirit, it his mere presence that drives them to fight with all they have. 

Behind you the furball begins, growls, shouts, yowls and clashes as claws meet metal ring from behind you. The only sound lacking is the sound of approaching paws on the wooden floor. True to his word, the line has been held.

(ooc: You guys are not actually required to fight in the threat behind you. If you wish to join that fight, you write your way in and you'll be involved, but until you do you will **not** be taking automatic damage from that fight. Ransford, as long as he has HP, will keep that fight behind you. Rica has a set HP value, though is a boss character in the best of ways. Ransford will not be helping with the boss fight. Ransford was not incorrect that fleeing is an option either, remember this isn't a video game and every fight doesn't have to happen.

This is considered a new fight. You're going to lose the dice from last round you haven't rolled yet, but damage has been reset for Atalantia and Afina so you're all fresh and ready to boss battle.)

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-11*

Afina freezes up as the bandit leader rouses her troops, tense as the growls and barks begin to reverberate off the walls of the room. The light circle around the bandit leader fades as Afina turns to look behind her, and laguz clash with Ransford’s remaining forces. She then glances back to the leader, as Atalantia seems to be struggling to find an opening to land a decisive blow. 
As a princess, it aches Afina’s heart to see the valiant men and women, pained and bleeding, trying to hold the line against the laguz. Deciding to straddle both sets of combat, she takes formation behind Ransford’s men. As annoying as Ransford was, Afina didn’t want to see more soldiers injured because of their mission. Palm directed at the advancing beasts, Afina fires multiple scatter shots into the crowd. Laguz stumble and clutch themselves as the blazing light shots pierce their bodies, but do not halt in their approach. 
With a dull thunk resounding behind her, Afina whips around to face Atalantia, who had tumbled to the center of the room with one hit from the laguz leader. Afina almost bends down to help the wolf laguz up, but realizes the threat should be contained first. A pillar of light shoots up around the bandit leader, and the fiery leader takes a swipe at it, pulling back with a hiss to cradle her hand.

“Elfriede, Atalantia, I’ll provide support, as my ability to engage in ranged attacks is limited. Both of you are stronger in close vicinity. I have your backs,” she declares, letting the light barrier fall. Afina wanted this fight over and done with, but losing her temper like earlier would just cause her to embarrass herself once more. The best she could hope for would be assisting her stronger comrades with all her might. 
Rica growls once more, and small beam of light, hardly larger than a fist, shoots through the leader’s chest. Rica shudders only slightly, holding her chest. “We have committed no wrongs against you! Your arguments are illogical because you blame a group for the actions of the few! Surrender now and you will be treated with fair justice in the eyes of the kingdom of Laera!” Afina declares, addressing the leader herself, chin held high. “Should you not come quietly, my companions will be forced to take necessary action!” 
Rica’s response makes it clear that this fight will not be halted with a surrender. The stakes were too high, especially for a leader. And if the leader is weak… _ then we'll live in a world full of weak authority thrust into the ruling position_, Afina thinks to herself, repeating the phrase so familiar to her. Afina turns her back to the laguz leader, instead firing a few quick bursts of light into the skirmishing soldiers. The effort was draining, and she would surely burn through this book of spells quickly, but if it could bring about a ceasefire then it would surely be worth the effort. 
Afina turns back to watch her companions take up arms against Rica. “Eyes!” she calls, as a light collects in her palm, preparing to fire a purifying beam at the leader.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-12*

Knight Lieutenant Faun stopped halfway to Rica and watched as the battlefield shaped under Ransford's will. He had seen it many times, the sheer power of a group working together was always something that he admired. Ransford’s persona was questionable, but his leadership and combat skills were clearly remarkable.

Unorganized and confused, the transformed Laguz were certainly losing to the soldiers. Afina unleashed a bombardment of light into the crowd of transformed Laguz causing even more confusion. Afina was in no current danger, so Elfriede turned his eyes elsewhere. Everyone seemed like they were holding decently well except for Atlantia who had her hands full with his monster leader. Elfriede gritted his teeth and moved up onto the platform to engage Rica. 

Elfriede looked to Atalantia and smiled disarmingly. “I know you wanted this for yourself, but I can't allow you to risk your life for your pride when I’m right here.” Faun’s eyes move back to Rica and his face drops again to a grimacing visage. He sighs lightly and steadies himself, readying his weapons. “What you are doing out here is useless and despicable. I have nothing more to say to you.”

The laguz boy in disguise eyes darted all over her body sizing up this powerhouse that was giving Atalantia so much trouble. Everywhere skin showed or the clothing clung to her body, layers of defined, corded muscle showed her power. Her arms were toned to wield her axe with ease and strength. Elfriede knew that one hit from her could end any fight. Just looking at her confident smirk made Elfriede respect her. It’s obvious why she was the leader of this tribe of foolhardy bandits. She reminded him of his sister Yuria; such confidence and strength. Elfriede realized he had begun to sweat just sizing her up. Faun’s eyes met hers again and he could tell; She knew why he was looking at her so intently. 

As she sneered at him, her black hair hung in front of her face and she didn’t bother to move it aside. Her confidence alone was overwhelming and they hadn't even started fighting yet. He pointed his rapier in her general direction and readied his dagger. Slowly, Elfriede started circling her waiting for the sneering kissaelain to make the first move.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-15*

Atalantia shutters as her chest gets sliced by Rica's blade; she couldn't believe that she had allowed herself to become vulnerable once again. While being distracted by her own disbelief, Atalantia becomes hit yet again by the blunt end of Rica's axe. This hit causes Atalantia to shoot across the room like a flying bullet. 
After flying across the room, Atalantia lays on the ground hoplessly looking towards the bleak ceiling, which mirrored the amount of disappointment Atalantia was feeling. Atalantia's mind started flooding with more negative thoughts revolving around the concept of, *"How can such a poor leader be stronger than me?* While sulking, Atalantia's negative thinking becomes disrupted once Rica begins her attempt to motivate her weakened army of bandits. Atalantia begins to laugh at the petty sight of Rica finally making a half-hearted speech towards her bandits. Atalantia then begins to push herself off the ground, mustering the remaining amounts of fiery conviction she had to convince herself that she could still win this fight. 

As the room becomes utterly quiet, Atalantia takes the opportunity to disrupt the silence and yell at all those who remain in the enclosed room.
"Oh how foolish you all must be to follow a leader who dares not approach the same battlefield as you all. You all have been following this woman's orders, but what has she done for you? In this very moment you all have one important choice to make...you can either leave this battle and live, or you can stay and face absolute death."
-------

As the battle appears to resume. Atalantia takes a moment to nod towards Afina who is planning to assist with support. Atalantia was quite impressed with the princess' invested interest in helping her; she had always thought that the princess would remain weary towards her.
Atalantia transforms into her wolf form in order to avoid any oncoming laguz bandits, who might be blocking her way toward Rica. If she was going to win, she must conserve any energy she has left for the battle against Rica.
Once up on the platform, Atalantia changes back into her human form quickly grabbing her blades in case someone attempts to attack her in this state. No one dared bother to attack Atalantia, so she then looks toward Elfriede who was circling Rica, preparing to engage in combat. While Atalantia was clearly disappointed and a bit aggrivated at Elfriede's choice to assist in fighting Rica, she couldn't help but be slightly appreciative that he seemed to want to help protect Atalantia from any mortal danger. In a determined tone Atalantia begins to speak....
"Elfriede, if you insist on helping me, I only ask of one thing. May you help in getting Rica vulnerable enough so that I may have the final blow? This was my battle from the start... I wish for it to be mine at the very end."

Atalantia then begins to join Elfriede in circling Rica, but on the direct opposite side in order to create a flank on Rica. Hopefully this new tactic with Elfriede would allow Atalantia to finally finish this aggrivating battle.

**Bill** - *2018-01-15*

Ransford stands in a wide stance with his troops to his side. They group arcs slightly, Ransford at the center of the curve. The laguz swarm in the center of the arc, diving and clawing at Ransford and his men. Ransford bounces muzzle after muzzle off his shield, while using his sword's reach to dissuade any clever animals from trying to slip through a crack in the men's guard. The laguz aren't fools though. Ransford won't break the line even to strike a final blow and the laguz take advantage of this, doing strafing damage against the Commander and slipping away before they can be taken out of the fight. The battle in front of Ransford is truly a gauntlet of some form. 

- - -

An axe blade crashes into the floor boards between Atalantia and Eflriede as they exchange words. "Call me a jealous town girl, but I don't like being ignored." Rica remarks dryly. She flips herself over the embedded axe like a gymnast, pulling the axe out as part of her flip. She spins around with a wild axe swing, slashing at the nearer Atalantia and then releasing the blade as it flies towards Elfriede in a whirling dervish of cold steel. 

Rica transforms, leaping at Atalantia. The tigress puts her forepaws on the wolf leader's shoulders, forcing her to the floor with her significant transformed weight. Claws rake Atalantia's shoulders as the tigress seems to sneer despite her form.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-15*

Faun glanced down briefly toward Afina, concerned that she might have been beset upon by the enemy Laguz forces. In that moment he was caught off guard. Rica’s arms suddenly flexed as she was clearly tired of being ignored. Her axe came end over end came twirling at Elfriede at an insane speed. Despite his honed, agile muscles from the days spent training, he knew there was no way he was going to deflect the massive twirling missile. Such a blow would go right through any guard he might put up. Almost in slow motion Elfriede watched the approach of the weapon and suddenly fell backwards. He felt the gust of the passing weapon on his face as he fell onto his rear. It wasn’t a graceful fall but it got the job done. He yet again felt cold sweat gathering and his hands and sides. Rica’s insane strength was overwhelming, almost inhumanely so. He heard the loud thunk as the axe implanted itself deep into a wooden support beam for the hall.

“And you wanted to fight this monster on your own?!” Elfriede called out as he stood up. The knight-leiutenant watched as Rica leaped onto Atalantia with claws beared and he winced as he saw them come down on his companions shoulders, but he couldn't make out the damage.

"Atalantia!"

His footsteps started toward the beast form on top of Atalantia and swiftly sped up to quick tapping as he sped toward the two prone women. Faun didn’t want to risk getting caught close to Rica, so as he approached he jumped off with one foot and planted both feet into the tigress’s ribs attempting to kick her off and away from Atalantia.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-16*

Bursts of light radiated among the violent laguz crowd, a new candescent orb appearing one after another. Whimpers and yelps punctuated the snarling mass, but Ransford’s men themselves seemed to slowly be wearing thin. Afina froze, searching for a spell that could potentially offer more efficacy. Finally, a tome came to mind, and a popping, sizzling ball of light materialized above the fighting crowd. Small sparks crackled off the light ball, but were hardly noticed above the clash of weapons and hollering of soldiers. A few bandits hesitated, seeing such an inexplicably bright light, but few took note of the magic, or the mage conjuring it. 
In an instant, the ball of light exploded, shooting condensed beams of light down at the fighting crowd below. More yells rang through the room as the light pierced the bandits’ bodies with intense agony. Weapons clattered to the floor and laguz gripped their invisible wounds, falling to their knees. Afina smiled confidently as the tide of the fighting seemed to shift back into the soldiers’ favor.

Turning to see her companions, Afina’s face immediately fell. Elfriede had stumbled backwards, breathing hard, as an axe embedded itself in the wood behind him. Atalantia, meanwhile, was in a similar state, pinned to the ground by the laguz leader in tiger form. Afina gasped as Elfriede stood up and took off running for their companion. With a yell, Elfriede jumped feet forward, and Afina quickly reacted. A bright light flashed as his feet made contact with Rica’s side, and a wave of pain shot through her body. One claw retracted from Atalantia’s shoulder to swat at the knight, who had managed to keep a safe distance with his attack. Atalantia grunted with anguish as blood continued to flow from her wound, forcing up her injured arm to keep Rica’s tiger teeth away. 
Afina took advantage of the leader’s loosened hold, working quickly to form a white circle on the ground beneath Atalantia and her attacker. The next instant, a column of white light swallowed up both women, with vastly different reactions between the two. Afina hoped the momentary distraction would be enough to give Atalantia the upper hand, and a small smile pulled at the corner of Afina’s mouth, despite the encroaching mental fatigue. As the beacon of light faded out, Afina expression dropped and she met Elfriede’s gaze quickly, giving a curt nod to show she was still going to support them. _As long as this fight finishes in a timely manner_ she thought, turning her back to assist Ransford’s soldiers.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-18*

Atalantia smirks at the sight of Rica becoming jealous at being ignored; *Geez this woman is full of herself* Atalantia thinks to herself as she continues to circle Rica.
Despite her efforts to remain focused, Atalantia is taken off guard by Rica’s quick change in demeanor. Rica was no longer sitting back an observing the two friends chat; Rica had chose to attack both of the friends, swinging her giant axe at Atalantia. The distracted Atalantia attempts to block Rica’s swing, allowing her footwork to portray that of a inebriate individual trying to dance. Atalantia manages to block the axe strike, but her wobbliness causes Rica to be able to knock Atalantia prone onto the cold platform in tigress form.

Atalantia had gotten herself into a very tight situation. Not only was Rica’s tigress body much larger than hers, but her forepaws were restricting Atalantia from breaking free. Rica’s appears to acknowledge Atalantia’s disadvantages and begins to further impair the weakened warrior. Rica’s claws quickly stratch against Atalantia’s shoulders, tearing the flesh in that area. Blood began to gush out of the wounds like a waterfall, slowly accumulating enough to the point where Atalantia could not see the true extent of the damage in her current state.
Atalantia began to scream in anguish as her flesh was being ripped clean off. Atalantia’s world began to spin as she felt blood rush to her forehead. Atalantia knew she had to get out of this situation quickly, otherwise she might even face an encounter with death.
Just before all seemed hopeless, Atalantia notices a faint white circle appear under both her and Rica. To Atalantia the light felt like a warm hug comforting her from the pain of her wounds; it was almost as if Afina was trying to send the message not to give up and that all will be ok. Such a concept was very soothing to Atalantia, and filled her with additional desire not to surrender. To Rica, the light must have caused immense pain for she began to wince and scream on the top of her lungs, almost as if she was being tortured. It was in this moment that Atalantia knew that this was her chance.

She begins to lift her legs up towards the tigress’ chest; her legs begin to shake profusely as a result of the strain on Atalantia’s body.  While pushing her legs forward, Atalantia notices Elfriede attempting to kick Rica off her injured body as well. Atalantia proceeds to push against Rica’s firm chest at the same time Elfriede does. Through much pain and strain, and with the help of her friends, Atalantia is able to lift Rica’s body into the air enough so that Atalantia can roll over and escape the tight situation.

Once Atalantia rolls over, she slowly pushes herself from the ground. One would think that using shoulder strength in this situation would cause loads of pain, but Atalantia’s adrenaline rush was prohibiting her from understanding the true severity of her wounds. Atalantia’s world sight started to become both fuzzy, yet focused. If Rica could cause so much pain to Atalantia, who knows how much pain she could do to others if allowed to continue her bandit ways. 
Atalantia looks towards Rica who is still screaming like a mad woman, most likely from the lingering effect of the white light Afina had placed under her. If Atalantia was going to win this fight, this was her brief opportunity to get Rica at a disadvantage. Atalantia raised both of her dual blades over her head and they began shining like the rays of the sun from the light of the room reflecting on them, almost mirroring the fiery aura that surrounded Atalantia. Atalantia then braces towards the vulnerable tigress and jumps into the air with one knee forward so that she would be able to get enough momentum for a downward strike. Both of atalanta's dual blades then come crashing down, piercing in between both of Tigress Rica’s shoulders. Atalantia is unable to see Rica’s expression in this moment, but assumes that she must have at least impaired Rica a little with this successful strike. 

Accepting her injured state, Atalantia acknowledges the extent to which she would need her friends’ help in order to finish off this foolish bandit leader.
 “Don’t just stand there! This is our chance! Attack!!!!” Atalantia yells towards Elfriede as best as she could in a very breathy tone. 
Atalantia then briefly looked towards Afina, giving her a nod, hoping that Afina would understand the amount of appreciation Atalantia had for her help.

Ransford frowns as light rains from above his head into the laguz crowd in front of him. "Focus on your own damn fight Princess!" he bellows over his shoulder as he bashes his shield into the nose of a tiger. The tiger bounces into the crowd and Ransford steps forward with wave of his sword. His men follow the motion wordlessly and press the advantage Afina created. Ransford thrusts into the back of a crouching tiger and kicks the body off his blade, raising his shield to meet claws leaping at his face. He forces his shield forward and launches the tiger into the air. With a swipe of his blade he cuts the tiger's stomach as it falls the the ground, all the while Ransford watching the line to find his next target to keep the wall blocked.

- - -

Rica yowls in pain as she rolls across the floor, launched by the mage's spell and the knight's kick. Before she slams into the platform she sinks a claw into the wood and slows her slide. With her reduced speed she is able to position her haunches against the platform and spring board off of it. It launches her straight into Atalantia's dual bladed assault, leaving long gashes across the tigress's back and evoking an angry yowl from her anew.

Rica loses her footing and ends up rolling across the floor again after taking her the wounds from Atalantia. This time she transforms mid roll and angles herself towards where her axe has embedded itself. She yanks the blade out to stop her roll and quickly brings it in front of her, looking for where Atalantia and the funny smelling one with the rapier ended up. With a deep breath she gets her bearings on her and focuses. 

Rica rushes the closer of the two, the Eraian knight. She preps her axe on her left and slides as she approaches the knight. She slashes low across Elfriede's legs from her lower vantage point and spins with the axe as it whips around her body. She lets it embed in the floor behind her as her back turns to Elfriede. Before she gives the knight a chance to attack she flips up and kicks into Elfriede's chest with her left foot and his chin with her right. She flips over the blade and pulls it out as part of the flip, the blade slicing at Elfriede as it follows the arc she took in a dangerous parody of leapfrog. She spins on a heel with her axe in position to angle herself better and to dissuade a follow up while she gets her footing back.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-18*

Afina had returned to the soldiers holding the line. Small crackles of light continued to burst through the ranks of laguz, slowing down their forces considerably. The effort to hinder Rica had been considerably exhausting, and Afina had resorted to smaller attacks to keep the forces away from her companions. 
Suddenly above the din, Ransford hollered. The princess hesitated, leaving just enough of an opening for a cat laguz to slip through the defensive line and latch onto her leg. Afina yelped, falling backwards as the cat dug its teeth and claws into her calf, right above her boots. Tears of pain pooled in the corners of her eyes as the sharp teeth gripped her leg, dark red beginning to stain her tights.
With a grunt, the princess unsheathed her dagger, blinking the tears out of her eyes to see. She jabbed at the laguz’s hind leg, hoping to create a painful, yet non-lethal injury. The thrust met its mark, and the cat yowled with pain, claws holding on tight to her leg, the jostle of the small animal’s body forcing more blood from her wounds. Gritting her teeth Afina twisted the knife, and the cat’s claws finally retracted, the creature collapsing on the floor in pain.

With a sharp inhale, Afina pulled out the knife and returned it to the sheath on her back, watching as the cat laguz heaved with pain on the floor beneath her. Staggering to her feet, Afina glared at the incapacitated animal, and spared but a moment to spit on its face, redirecting herself back towards the fight. Afina wiped the tears off her cheeks.Thankfully, though bleeding, her wound was small enough that it didn’t impair her conjuring. Afina tried to take a step forward and winced. It _did_ leave her with a distinct limp until medical attention could be sought. 
Afina shook her head, trying to clear the hazy fatigue from her mind. She was a _princess_; that fact alone put her a distinct cut above those present in the room. She shouldn’t tire so easily. Focusing on the fight ahead of her, Afina watched as Rica focused her assault anew on Elfriede. Squinting, Afina directed her magic at Rica once more. If she could place a light ball in just the right position, she could try to purify the laguz leader from the inside…
Unexpectedly, a blocking soldier back stepped into Afina, knocking her onto her stomach in the middle of the battlefield. She gasped as the air was knocked from her lungs, and her book fell on the floor before her, mid-sentence. Her spell was, in turn, sabotaged, flashing in front of Rica’s face instead of within her body. Afina hoped that the spell would at least stun the leader, allowing Atalantia to get an attack in while Elfriede recovered and she got back to her feet.

Wheezing air back into her chest, Afina shakily got back to her feet. Her arms were smudged with dried blood from their last skirmish. Blood blossomed on her left leg from the cat laguz’s attack. Flakes of dried blood still caked parts of her cheek, and clung to her bright hair. The dried blood was the worst, and it was everywhere. Her hands. Her dress. Her book. This was the most disheveled the princess had looked in years. She was… offended. 
Filled with a new vigor, Afina directed her light spells at the laguz leader once more. She was determined to prove herself a learned enough individual to take down a simple laguz bandit. Another burst of light exploded above her comrade's heads, and sparkles of light rained down on Rice, Elfriede, and Atalantia.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-18*

Faun firmly kicked off the tigress into a backflip, landing neatly a few meters away. Elfriede breathed easier for a second as she was kicked off his laguz companion. Suddenly, Rica was up again and charging in his direction taking several cuts from Atalantia’s twin sabres. Elfriede side stepped as Rica came rolling across the floor passed him toward her… **weapon**. *Shit* 

“Afina! Atalantia! We have to end this *soon*”

In a flash, Rica was leaping above Elfriede as the boy braced himself to dodge or parry. The huge unwieldy axe implanted itself in front of Elfriede before she even came down. Then Rica was flipping. Even Elfriede’s keen eyes couldn't keep track of her insane movements. He braced himself for an axe swing that did not come.

Faun felt and *sharp* impact on his chest that shook him to his core. He felt his ribs almost buckle under the weight of the kick from Rica and all his air was blasted out of his lungs. Elfriede was already flying back before he knew what happened. Then, before he even moved an inch her second foot kicked off his face sending him spinning in a spiral.

The knight bounced across the floor at an incredible speed and *splatted* up against the back wall near the throne. Both weapons clanged down in front of him. Elfriede’s vision blurred as he almost passed out from the impact. He slid down the wall onto all fours wondering in that moment how he was still among the living. Then came the shallow breathes as Elfriede struggled to breathe under a collapsed lung. It felt like he was drowning. He grasped at his chest with one hand in a coughing fit as his lung finally separated itself and his vision slowly focused to the floor in front of him.

Faun briefly stared at the blood droplets on the floor that he knew came from his coughing. He looked up and around as his companions fighting Rica valiantly and grasped his weapons. Elfriede steadied himself and got back into stance. The knight went to shout to rally his allies, but realized he couldnt speak at that moment. He’d have to let his actions speak.

Somehow, despite everything Elfriede sprinted toward Rica ready to riposte anything she threw at him. Faun and Rica reengaged on even footing swinging and blocking and parrying eachother. Steel ringing out as Elfriede tried to keep up the pace of his attacks. He couldnt relent and let her get a full swing. “This pressure *must* be kept.” Faun thought to himself silently. He was focused on the barrage of slights and rapier thrusts as he searched for a opening.

**Atalantia Enneka (Allison)** - *2018-01-22*

Atalantia begins to jump into the air like a giddy child upon realizing that her blades had in fact caused some physical damage to Rica. This moment of happiness came to a halt as Atalantia noticed Rica recovering from her pain and began bracing towards Elfriede. 
*Oh, Shit.* Atalantia thought to herself as she quickly transformed into her wolf form in effort to get closer to Elfriede in order to block him from any potential danger. Despite her efforts, Atalantia was too late; she watched Elfriede get hurtled across the room after being kicked by Rica.

Atalantia gasped at the sight of Elfriede’s limp body against the wall. She wondered if Elfriede’s previous wounds had opened up, and if so, she would wear a sullen pout because of the fact that she did not wish for him to assist her in the first place in the event in which he would get hurt.
Atalantia continued to prance across the room in her wolf form towards Rica, and effortlessly transformed back into her humanized form upon reaching Rica’s backside. It was at this moment that Atalantia observed a light flash before Rica’s eyes. *”Yes Afina!”* Atalantia thought as she dove and swung both of her blades at Rica’s posterior knees.

As Atalantia struck both of the posterior knees, Rica tilted her body backwards a bit causing Atalantia to fall to the ground. From the ground, Atalantia noticed Elfriede rising from his dire state like a zombie. Atalantia continued to watch Elfriede’s facial expressions, and could have sworn that she saw his eyes glisten with determination. Such a sight, whether true or not, both surprised and impressed Atalantia. She knew that if Elfriede could have the strength to continue combat, she must too. 
Atalantia sprung up from the ground with quite enthusiasm; she then ran to Rica and Elfriede who were continuously parrying. As both of the warriors fought, Atalantia decided to insert herself into the battle as well. During this moment, Afina’s rain of light seemed to be cast on all three warriors. 
Atalantia then engaged her full attention into the battle and observed the situation for an opening to appear. The moment it did, Atalantia did not hesitate and quickly jabbed one of her dual blades into Rica’s side, once it penetrated Rica’s flesh Atalantia twisted her blade and quickly pulled it out. Hopefully Atalantia, Elfriede, and Afina would be able to further use their teamwork abilities in order to defeat Rica.

**Bill** - *2018-01-22*

Ransford kicks an injured cat aside as if it were a ragdoll and adds another 5 feet of distance between the escaped zoo before him and the battle raging behind him. His shoulder feels like it's on fire, every moment that passes he can feel his shield arm sinking. The muscles just can't support the heavy steel, tired from deflecting powerful tigers and blades. Claws start to sneak by his guard when he can't get his shield in the way in time. Ransford makes sure to punish any of the fools who marr him, his sword flashing through fur, flesh and bone over and over again. 

A luck blow by one of the few humanoids attacking him, nails his sword arm hard. Ransford groans, dropping his blade. He drops to a crouch immediately, making the fool think the Commander had been dropped. The swordman lifts his claymore over his head for a decapitating blow only to find Ransford's shield slammed into his body. Ransford dives into the bandit, pushing him over and putting the Commander's weight and the metal shield on top of the laguz. Ransford quickly rolls, releasing his shield and grabbing the laguz's claymore, the nearest weapon. The Commander takes the hilt in both hands and begins a series of wide space clearing slashes, taking his place on the line once more. 

---

*"Despite the smell... he's persistent."* Rica muses as Elfriede engages her again. She has no further time for thought, her hands moving frantically to keep time with the swordsman's blows. She uses the hilt of her axe exclusively, the double blade too clumbersome for such an intense melee. A smile creeps onto her face as the heat of combat becomes palpable, sweat dripping from her and the knight's brows as they dance the most dangerous dance there is.

In her excitement, she fails to notice Atalantia in time to avoid the sneak attack the girl executes on her. Swerving her body just enough to prevent a lethal stomach would she grits her teeth as the blade cuts her stomach. Rica drops to a crouch, ducking Elfriede's last swing rather than blocking it. With her axe free to swing she swings from her right, slicing low at Elfriede and angling the blade into an uppercut that crosses Atalantia's body. Her true motive for the massive swing becomes clear as she spins with the blade, doing a backflip using the weight of the blade to carry her back a dozen paces before she lands on her feet.

"You bark and whine about honor, yet you stab me in the back do you? Who exactly are you calling a coward girl?" Rica yells at Atalantia. She twist her whole body into throwing her axe at Atalantia, whirling around faster as if a buzzsaw and flicking blood about the room. 

The axe blade is only the start of her assault, Rica leaps up right behind the blade her tigress form, teeth poses for Atalantia's neck. They fall, the fall preventing Rica from lining up a savage bite to Atalantia's neck and instead only allowing the tigress to sink her fangs into Atalantia's shoulder. The tigress actually spits on Atalantia before leaping off the girl with claws out, her hind legs cutting into Atalantia's thighs and her her forepaws the wolf's shoulders.

Rica transforms in her leap grabbing her axe from the ground and running the last few steps to Afina. The axe is raised at a diagonal and Rica swings the heavy blade down to cut Afina from shoulder to hip across.

**Afina (Georgia)** - *2018-01-22*

Afina’s eyes shined triumphantly as she watched her companions rise once more to take on Rica. Elfriede seemed to hold his own against the laguz leader, both individuals parrying and jabbing at each other, with the two seemingly in a deadlock. Atalantia rushed from behind, landing a decisive blow before the tiger woman is able to react. Time seemed to speed up, and Afina realized that Rica had turned her focus to none other than the light mage herself. 
The princess ran through the calculations quickly. Rica was sprinting, raising her axe, angling it on a diagonal. She was meaning to cut across her chest. Afina’s free hand twitches in a movement for her dagger, but realizes the momentum of the axe would be impossible to stop with standard defensive blocks. Her other hand tightens around the book’s spine, but any such spell would only affect Rica, not her weapon. Light magic didn’t have an effect on inorganic objects. 
As the woman is within striking distance, Afina drops her book, letting it fall open on the floor beneath her as she unsheathes her dagger. She stood a better chance at blocking with a weapon over a spell.

Afina reached up to block the axe’s trajectory with her dagger, and the loud clang of metal rang through the atrium. However, her block did little to deter Rica’s swing, only managing to slow the axe’s descent and change its trajectory. The axe sliced through the light blue fabric of her dress, bright red flowing from the wound across Afina’s abdomen. The princess stumbled, gasping with the shock of the pain, and clutching her stomach with her free hand.
Forcing her mind to process the events, Afina did a quick once-over of her injuries. Not injured organs, her clothes were still in tact. The injury pained her, and she was surely losing blood, but she could most definitely remain standing another few minutes. Rica sneered, taking a confident stance as she prepared to strike again. Afina straightened her back to the best of her ability, one arm holding pressure to her wound as the other held out her dagger. 
Rica pressed her attacks once more, though slowed down without the running start of her last hit. Afina blocked, releasing pressure on her wounds to handle the dagger with two hands. Despite her injuries, the princess seemed to hold her own in the fight, but it was dubious she could continue the efforts. Blood dribbled down her dress, and Afina’s own fear was near paralyzing. Her eyes burned with tears that threatened to spill over, and she bit her lower lip in an attempt to focus her concentration.

Rica roared, bringing the axe straight across in one hard swing. Afina ducked, swinging her dagger in a quick, small arc to embed it in Rica’s back thigh. The spot was always one relatively unprotected by armor and clothing, while also containing a major blood vessel. In Afina could land the hit perfectly, Rica would bleed out within minutes. Afina’s dagger met firm resistance in Rica’s hind leg, and Afina pushed the dagger deeper, twisting it once more before ripping it from the muscle. Afina spared a single moment to celebrate her hit, but that was enough time for Rica to manage a retaliation.
As the battle axe missed its target, the hilt came rearing back, hitting Afina across the cheek. In turn, the princess lost her footing in her evade, instead tumbling across the floor. On her hands and knees, Afina faced the laguz leader, breathing hard and ragged as the residual pain still stung her cheek. Rica sauntered over to the princess, hoping to deliver a final blow while her teammates scrambled to help her. Afina held out a hand to keep them at bay, knowing Elfriede and Atalantia could get injured in the crossfire.

Afina dropped her head as the leader approached, and even through her heartbeat racing in her ears, she could hear some lame monologue. Something about laguz being oppressed. Something about this being the proper judgement. All the dumb, falsified information that Afina could imagine. Rica was close enough now that she could smell the disgusting animal scent radiating off the woman. The princess couldn’t take it anymore. 
Afina lifted her face to the bandit leader, and Rica could see the princess’ mouth moving in quiet recitation. The gears turned in the leader’s head, as Afina moved her hands and knees to reveal her spell book beneath her. As the idea clicked, a bright light had already formed above Afina. The mage smiled, and in an instant, the light detonated. 
Like a stone hitting water, the light fanned outwards in one purifying blast, petering out before it reached her allies, but clearly enveloping Rica’s entire body. Rica shrieked above the noise of battle, and even a few of the skirmish’s participants stopped to stare in awe of the blast of light. The iridescence faded, revealing the two women that had been hidden by its light. Rica, weakened and vulnerable, but still a dangerous threat. And Afina, bloodied but with a bold look in her eyes, sitting with one arm propping her body up as the other gripped the injury around her waist.

**Elfriede (Tom)** - *2018-01-22*

Sweat ran down Faun’s brow as he worked his blades searching for an opening. How could one women fight off so many at once; she was making a fool out of them. They were all skilled fighters and yet there was no way any one of them could defeat her alone. The frustration was really getting to him for the first time in a long while. Elfriede again recalled training against his sister as a child and how useless he felt as she swatted aside every blow. He used to punch the ground in anger after every loss and she’d tell him to control his emotions. And he *had*.

Suddenly Rica swatted the air with her axe and disengaged with a flip. She quickly attacked Atalantia as payback for the blow inflicted on her moments prior. In his frustration, Elfriede moved to re-engage as Rica zipped passed him, axe in hand again. What games was she playing? Faun turned and his heart sank as he saw a line of crimson appear in a diagonal on Afina’s abdomen.

He froze for a moment as his failure sank in. He should have insisted **more** that they shouldn’t come here. To let his charge die here, in the middle of nowhere for no other reason then road safety and *pride*? How petty it all seemed in that moment. This scholar, this princess… Afina. Such a huge waste to the world if she fell here. A strange feeling began to well up inside him as Elfriede felt his blood boil. He gritted his teeth in a fit of frustration and anger. Rica was making them out to be fools with how she tore the party apart on her own, now this?! In that moment Elfriede realized he was biting his tongue in that moment with his sharper-than-normal canine teeth when he tasted blood. **[Invoke Aspect: - Hard to Anger, Hard to Calm down]**

He looked up with renewed determination and saw Afina surprisingly keeping Rica from landing a final blow. He felt a tinge of relief but he shook it off to hold on to his rare anger-fueled determination. Suddenly a ripple of light enveloped the scene. As it dispersed Elfriede caught a glimpse of Rica swaying from the blast. *Now.* Elfriede took off towards the injured tigress. As expected she turned upon hearing his footsteps and stepped forward. They engaged in another dance of slashing and thrusting as metal sounds resounded again. 

Realizing how tired he was Elfriede began gasping for breath mid combat. He stared at her eyes every chance he could get to show her how determined he was. Suddenly disrupting the dance, Elfriede parried with his rapier instead. It barely had an effect on the weapons trajectory but left him with enough room to thrust forward with his dagger. Suddenly Elfriede went flying back again as he was hit with the flat of the axe. He smirk as he collided with a pillar, again knocking the air out of him.

He coughed up more blood as he gasped for air.

“A hit for a hit Bandit scum?” Elfriede managed to cough out as he locked eyes with his dagger embedded firmly into Rica’s abdomen.

**Bill** - *2018-01-25*

Ransford slides to his left, blocking a claw from relieving one of his men of his intestines. The Commander had yet to make it to his own sword and shield, continuing to fight with the stolen claymore. It's earned him more nicks and dinges in the armor but it's kept him holding the line. His armor has taken so many hits he can't use his full range of motion. 

"Stand Darien, don't think getting injured here is going to get you out of morning drills." Ransford says and the soldier begrudgingly stands. 

*Still... we'll have to survive the night to do that.* Ransford thinks somberly. Ransford steps over to his own blade and shield while kicking a cat laguz back into the pack. "Boys, I'm going to thin this herd." Ransford says to no one in particular, picking up his weapons. "I'll leave the rest to you. Don't you worry. It won't be much." he says with a grim chuckle.

The Commander steps off the line and wades into the swarm of rabid laguz. Cats scratch at his greaves and he ignores it. Tigers leap at him and he twists out of the way or interposes his shield between him and them. And laguz close enough to his sword arm takes a fierce thrust through some part of their body. The tigers are at a disadvantage and against blade in such tight quarters. The cats are, well, not a threat anyway. Ransford is soon surrounded on all sides with a trail of collapsed forms showing his path from the defensive perimeter to where he makes his stand. The man is a twisting blur of shield and sword, punishing opponent after opponent as he blocks only the most lethal of blows to his person. He is quickly bloodied and with a might roar he cleaves into the dozenth tiger's neck.

Such opportunity comes at a high price. Ransford finds he can no longer raise his shield, the muscles in his arm protesting with firey pain. He falls to an unblocked blow and is quickly dogpiled by the big cats. A crazed, exhausted laughter echos out from beneath the pile. "I always did like dogs better!" Ransford laughs. His sword lances through the dogpile, causing the tigers aiming to tear his throat out to collapse on his own exhausted form. Ransford struggles once for the sake of it, but knows he's pinned and so ends his battle, for better or for worse. 

- - -

Rica groans weakly, her body spasming slightly as the blood loss from her thigh and now stomach drain her adrenaline. With a furious glare she spins and kicks Afina's prone form, sending the girl tumbling across the floor. 

"F..." she starts to stammer before catching it and starting again with renewed steel in her voice. "Funny... how you can't hurt me with anything large than a dagger. A... cowards weAPON!" she intones as she wrenches the dagger from her stomach. She coughs frantically, covering the floorboards with blood from her lungs. 

"You Eraian dogs are all alike." she growls. She takes a half step forward, clutching her stomach. She takes another and starts to straight out. She begins to walk, her hand returning to her axe hilt. "One less of you might just make Eraia *appreciate the laguz it has*!" she bellows.

She tosses her blade up and at Elfriede in a arcing toss. Her tigress form leaps up to grab the blade, spinning once in mid air before bringing it down with all the weight her form can muster at Elfriede's shoulder. The floorboards are crushed beneath the weight of the weapon and she shifts again with a primal yell. She rips the blade from the floor and spins, cutting into Elfriede again, horizontally this time, before releasing the blade as the end of her spin to launch it flying at Afina's collapsed form.

Elfriede collapses to the floor in front of Rica barely conscious, Rica's last slash pushing his high pain threshold over it's limit. Rica's axe rotates itself out of alignment as it flies and ends up pelting Afina in the face with the flat of the axe, knocking the princess backward and knocking her out cold. 

Rica twists her foot as to break towards Atalantia, but lamely slips and falls to her knees. The woman's breath is ragged and frantic and while her gaze is filled with energy her body seems to fail her entirely. She's left sitting there are the remaining soldiers lose the line without Ransford and the remaining laguz swarm towards their leader.

"That was... a hell of a fight..." Rica mutters with a grin on her pained face. A tiger steps forward from the protective circle formed around Rica and she barks "Hold. It's over." The tiger, along with many others, look back at her incredulously. 

"She slaughtered twice your number when you brought her here. You think you guys can really stand up to her, even injured? I'll tell you those blades are no joke." Rica stays. "It's their win. For now." She admits begrudgingly. She motions with her hands and after a moment of hesitation the remain laguz sheath their claws and back away. Rica is pulled onto another tiger's back. With no one between the door and the laguz, they make their way to the door still facing Atalantia. A few even spit in her direction.

"Go ahead little pup. Prove to the world that we're equals your way. I'll be watching for it." Rica says with a somber nod to Atalantia as she leaves the door frame. The room is silent, asides from a cough from Ransford, buried under three unconscious Tigers. You can hear foot steps from the other direction as well, the rest of Ransford's unit must finally be on their way.

Ransford unit is quick to address the wounded and unbury their Commander. Ransford hobbles to his feet, graciously accepting his subordinates help up. He leans on his sheathed sword, sheath detached from his waist, as he comes up to Atalantia.

"Well. They went to high and high water, dragging my ass along with them, to come help you. And here you were, slaughtering them like ribbon in the breeze." Ransford chuckles. "I'll wrap this hell hole up. Narder and his unit can escort the three of you back and heal you up. It would be a great comfort if you lot were back at the outpost not toppling any other gangs, at least for a few hours." Ransford waves Narder over who only grunts back and begins gathering his unit.

The troops carry Elfriede and Afina and offer a shoulder to Atalantia on the way up the hideout. Once reaching the top, the unconscious duo are put in their horses with a soldier to hold them and you're able to leisurely return to the outpost. Narder brings Elfriede and Afina back to the medic room they were in before, and spends the next hour on their wounds. He then leaves the three of you alone, letting you know that you all should rest and when the garrison returns he'll let you know.

(ooc: Table-5 is moving back to their home on table-2 now that they're no longer splitting the party)
